[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.940]   Redneck iMacs coming all sorts of interesting rumors
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.280]   on the Apple Horizon.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.440]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.480]   I'll come up next.

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.640]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.320]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.320]   This is episode 422.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.360]   I am Sarah Lane filling in for Mr. Leo Laport, who is on vacation in London this week.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.480]   In fact, I've been breathlessly watching all of his photos come in from the London
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.080]   eye and Clerages.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.480]   And he's eating lots of porridge and stuff like that.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.120]   But anyway, thanks, everybody, for being with us.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.520]   I am not alone here in studio.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.720]   I actually have Jason Snell sitting to my right.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.280]   Hello.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.120]   Hello, Jason.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   Would you say you are spending most of your time writing for sixcolors.com these days?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.640]   I am writing for sixcolors.com, my website.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.520]   And then I'm doing a tech podcast called Upgrade, which is on Relay FM.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.760]   You know, for the show, you mentioned to me that is apparently National Podcasters Day
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.880]   or Podcast Day.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.720]   Nobody told us.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   I had no idea.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.520]   I feel like this is something that really should be more in my wheelhouse anyway, doing
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   this for a living.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.840]   I didn't get you a card or anything.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.200]   I didn't get you anything either.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   We'll just agree to do this again next year.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.280]   It's the thought that counts, right?
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.120]   Over on my left is Indian Ocote, tech columnist for the Chicago Sun Times and one of the hosts
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   Hey, Andy.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   Hello.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.360]   Gosh, to be in London in September.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   Right.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.520]   It's so grainy and cold.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.320]   You'd feel it in your bones.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.200]   Actually, I don't really know anything about the weather in London.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.280]   And it's a good guess for any of you.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.360]   It's like a year round type of a situation.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.720]   But you're going to get a good time.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.800]   Your hat will be well washed by the time you've re-board your plane in Virgin Atlantic.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   It's fine.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Well, thanks for being here, Andy.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.200]   And of course, Renee Ritchie, editor at I'm or your editor, right?
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Your editor writer.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   You pretty much do everything.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Your podcaster as well.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Yep.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   Thanks.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.800]   Thanks for being here, Renee.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.640]   It's going really well, thanks.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   Winter is coming here, Sarah.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.720]   The trees are turning shades of golden red dragons and smarter creatures than me are
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   leaving for the south.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   Is that Canadian to talk like that?
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   Usually?
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   It's very poetic of you.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.360]   Well, it's very cold, Sarah.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.720]   We have a lot of times of thinking poetic senses.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.680]   To put together something that makes it all sound very beautiful.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.160]   Well, thanks everybody for allowing me to be part of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.640]   I always love the show because I sort of live and breathe everything that Apple makes
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   anyway.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.920]   So it's always a good time when I get to be part of the team.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.200]   It's nice to see Jason in person.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.680]   That doesn't happen very often.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.640]   No, we usually are on Skype or something.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   Right.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   Internet friends.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   Yeah, usually there's a little bit more.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   Much winter.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.600]   A few pipes and screens between us.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   All right.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.360]   This is not going to be hard to fill a couple of hours because we have so much material
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.560]   to start with.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.320]   I guess we can start with these.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.720]   There's a nine or five Mac story that Apple is changing things up a little bit with future
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.240]   versions of iOS 8.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.160]   Of course, iOS 8 came out what two weeks ago now, almost two weeks ago, two Wednesdays
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   ago.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.920]   Then we had the bit of the iOS 8.0.1 debacle, which was quickly fixed by Apple.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.800]   I think I don't think anyone's having too many problems anymore with the version that
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.120]   actually does not brick touch ID and your cellular service, which is something that in
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.280]   general, people with iPhones would like.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.200]   But that we might be rolling out on a little bit of a different schedule for future versions
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   of iOS.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.840]   That would be 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 in staggered rollout through 2015.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.320]   Does that surprise everybody?
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.560]   At this point, I feel like nothing that Apple does surprises me anymore because it's a different
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.240]   company that is doing things differently.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.440]   It's a return to form in the early days of iOS.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.680]   You always got the .1 version when the iPod touches came out in the fall and then you'd
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   get a .2 and a .3.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.840]   It was only, I forget it was iOS 5 or iOS 6, but they slowed down the point versions
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   then.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.720]   This is more of a return to the original program than anything.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.640]   You've got to wonder if there's a, is this attached to hardware or is this a different
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.640]   change in philosophy?
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.880]   It's attached to hardware.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.440]   You set up 8.1 for the new iPads that we're presumably going to get.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.760]   Maybe 8.2 is connectivity with the Apple Watch.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.000]   But I like the idea that maybe this is Apple shifting to a little bit different cadence
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.160]   for their OS updates.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.040]   I think what we've seen and maybe 8.01 was an example of it, maybe not, is that I think
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.000]   Apple has gotten really great at rolling their hardware out and that the software maybe has
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.760]   been struggling with their old processes to keep up with it.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.800]   I kind of like this idea of biting OS updates off in smaller chunks and rolling them out
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.640]   over time rather than dropping everything once a year.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.280]   And also we've all seen so many examples of Apple really chasing them their own tails
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.240]   on this treadmill of having to make the release by September for the new iPhones or trying
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.280]   to make this new on some arbitrary deadline.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.600]   It'd be nice if they simply said that we're going to have the .1 releases ready when they're
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   ready.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.720]   And if we don't have to push it out the door on an arbitrary schedule, we're going to
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   be able to do that.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.400]   And also I think it points to how many different services that Apple is rolling out over the
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   next couple of years.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.760]   They're really broadening out into services and markets that they haven't really spent
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.400]   much time messing around with.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.440]   And so if they have to wait for a to tag something to a hardware release or to an annual release
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.840]   schedule, they're not going to be able to drill up things like an expansion of the payment
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.880]   system or take advantage of new entertainment features that might be in the new Apple TV
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   and that sort of stuff.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.360]   So you make a good point, Jason, the iPad situation.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.800]   That makes sense that you might want to tie iOS, iOS 8, future versions of iOS 8 rollouts
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.240]   with obviously products that can be updated.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.600]   But then again, we know that the Apple Watch is not going to be running iOS.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   Right.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Right.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   But it has to talk to the phone.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   Sure.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.840]   It's some modified version of something that yes has to be compatible in some way.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.640]   But we've got all these product categories.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.280]   I mean, the Apple Watch, I guess we could talk about that.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.560]   It exactly knows when that is happening.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.400]   There's a story that I read on Mac rumors that said Apple will be lucky to ship the Apple
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.080]   Watch even by Valentine's Day.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.040]   I don't know what the significance of Valentine's Day would be.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.800]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.360]   It's code that it's actually going to be the luck of the Irish and it's going to ship
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.840]   on St. Patrick's Day.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.320]   It's secret Apple Co.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.800]   See, that would be really cool.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.320]   A green Apple Watch.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:13.240]   I guess I, besides the fact that I suppose you are buying and giving gifts that are Valentine's
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.840]   Day related, I'm not exactly sure what the February significance would be besides the
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   fact that that's just-
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.120]   Kind of find someone willing to buy me a rose gold watch really fast then.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.200]   It could be just as easy as whoever wrote that comment really, really swung and missed
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.240]   on the last gift they did for their student other Valentine's Day.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.360]   And now the only thing they can think about is what they have to get ready for Valentine's
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   Day.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.960]   So if they're going to pick out a date in the late winter, early spring, it's going to
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   be that.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.440]   I guess we have to assume that Apple really, really wanted to be able to not just introduce
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.720]   the Apple Watch at their iPhone event earlier this month, but have it ready to ship for
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   the holidays.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   I don't think so.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   No.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   I don't think so either.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   This is Apple's pattern.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.920]   These brand new Apple products end up being supply constrained because they're really hard
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   to build.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.680]   And so Apple's pattern with them generally has been to release them after the holidays
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:12.160]   are over so that they can sell them as many as they can make and by the next holiday season
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.680]   they'll be up to full speed on it.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.400]   And I think that's the approach here is that they wanted to give the rumors roll out there.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.480]   They wanted to get that announcement out the door before they have to go through regulatory
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.920]   things and anything like that and control that.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   And now everybody's going to, like us right now, we're going to be talking about it for
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.400]   all this time and then sometime next year they'll ship it and it'll probably trickle
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   out.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.200]   And I think they would have been completely not been able to fulfill need if they had
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.600]   made it available for the holidays.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   Two thoughts I had on that was if I was one of the reasons why I was thinking that Apple's
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.040]   going to do something simpler like a fitness ban was because they certainly would love
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.560]   to take advantage of the holiday season.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.920]   I'd see no indication they're ready to ship something as complicated as what they actually
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   showed.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.240]   So I was figuring how about something simple that they have the capacity to make that
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.280]   they can make at a good price point of that people would absolutely want to get his gifts.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.160]   But the second thing is that the more information, excuse me, the more I think about it, the
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.400]   more I think that there are a lot of signs that the Apple Watch is still in its early
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.960]   stages that we're not looking at something that is finished, finished, finished.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.120]   And now they just need to get the regulatory approval and now they need to get the partners
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.240]   in line to get the developers in line.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.200]   I think that it's earlier than we might think and that the stuff that Apple showed off at
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.040]   the event a few weeks ago is what they showed that was actually functioning and working as
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.880]   opposed to the stuff that they're still scrambling to get actually finished and approved.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.840]   Well, I tapped on something on the...
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.200]   I mean, we were all there.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.840]   They put the phone, one or the phone, the watch on our wrist and then they had another
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   one that was functional.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.000]   The one on our wrist was just running a demo.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.920]   And I remember I tapped on one of the icons on the screen and the guy looked like he was
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.440]   going to freak out because he was like, "No, no, you're not supposed to tap on it.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   Only we're supposed to tap on it."
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.800]   And that was clearly like there were things that they had in the script.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   Imagine a couple of showing off his guitar collection.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.120]   No, no, don't even point at it.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   Just look, don't look at it.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.760]   Don't even look at it.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.400]   And it reminded me of the original iPhone where I tapped on some of the icons on the
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.240]   original iPhone the day they announced it and it was screenshots.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.320]   It was like this app will go here later.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   So what does it mean if you tap on anything?
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.520]   If it's just a demo anyway?
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.760]   I think with this it's that there are things that are going to crash the phone or that
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.040]   they don't want to show and that there were things that were working that they wanted
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.360]   to show and that having us touch the device was not part of the script.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.960]   So I felt really bad for the guy because I mean I was like looking around to see if his
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.280]   minder was going to come and sweep in and take him away.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.480]   But it's not ready.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.640]   It's totally not ready in that experience.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.000]   It was like you could see like the invisible force field that the demonstrations were erecting
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.440]   between you and the watch that if you made a sudden movement towards something or if you
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   did something that they weren't really planning for you to do you could just see the key key
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   key key key key key.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   Okay.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   That's fine.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.560]   And that was that happened like twice with a couple of different demonstrators that I
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.560]   was working with them.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.000]   I knew that this was not a place to stress test anything or see if anything was working
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.200]   because I was the nature of the event they weren't showing off a finished object.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   So I don't think it would have been appropriate.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.760]   But you could tell that they were like oh God I think this guy has hairy risk over heat
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.040]   and explode to the hairy risk.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   Get him to shave.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.200]   I wasn't trying to crash it or anything.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.400]   I was just trying to see if those icons looked really small.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.760]   I wanted to see how easy they were to tap and if I would miss tap and it worked.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.840]   The thing I tapped on opened and then the guy was then he turned pale and ran out.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   Now you know why engineers disconnect interface before handing those things over for demos.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.960]   But Andy's larger point totally remains which is this is a product that is going to take
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.120]   some time before it's ready.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.760]   And not just stalling because of production line they're fixing.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.200]   This is why they didn't mention the battery life other than to say at the end of the day
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.440]   you can charge it because I think they don't know the battery life because it's not the
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.040]   software is not done.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.560]   I think that goes back to Jason's earlier point two because we just had iOS 8.1 seated
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.840]   to developers yesterday and it's got hooks buried in it for the Apple Pay system.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.640]   So you know that'll come out it'll enable Apple Pay.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.120]   You'll have touch ID on the iPads that it'll enable as well.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.560]   And then as we move through the year they'll have the version that enables the watch and
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.120]   maybe that works with the new Apple TV and then they might have a version later in the
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.360]   year as we started setting up for iOS 9.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.480]   But it's it really is a what's the best way to put it.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.000]   It is a marathon composed of sprints like they literally sprint towards release day every
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.240]   September and then they have very little time because they're already working on iOS 9.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.520]   They're going back and fixing iOS 8 bugs and it's it is a is a grueling cycle and I think
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.080]   breaking it up like this and especially with the watch coming at them.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.920]   And you have to imagine it took a lot of people off other projects to move to the watch project
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.640]   and have to fill both that team up and the previous teams up that it's going to be a
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.240]   good juggling act come the spring.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.960]   You know somebody in our chat room a couple minutes ago makes a good point that I think
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.360]   is I think is is is really going to to mirror what a lot of other consumers think is okay
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.880]   when the first iPhone was released it was expensive.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.920]   It was different but it was something that hey you need a phone.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.800]   So this might just be a new exciting expensive version of the phone that you already had
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.680]   and it's a brave new world and it worked out really well for Apple.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.120]   The watch thing a lot of us are still kind of scratching our heads about well I don't
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.960]   I certainly don't need one because I already have a phone that tells me what time it is.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.520]   So then it turns into something where it's like is it comfortable does it look cool.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.280]   Base price is $350 and we're all sort of agreeing that yeah you know the first version
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.960]   of this watch might not be perfect.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.480]   Yeah much as the iPhone wasn't as well but it's that product category that's elective
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.560]   rather than oh I need this.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.120]   Yeah interesting thing is you can never see the.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.560]   Go ahead Renee I'll go after you.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.880]   I was going to say you could never see the future in advance it always looks you know
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.400]   misty and foggy but when you get it Apple's Apple doesn't really make these different devices
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.480]   they package them that way but they make small increasingly small computers that connect
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.080]   you with a bunch of things and a watch now is a luxury but we have a phone not because
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.520]   we really need a phone we have a phone because we need to stay connected and whether Apple
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.640]   can move enough connectivity to the watch enough control enough authentication enough
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.480]   logging to the watch to make it better in certain situations than the phone is that'll
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.880]   be the real story we can tell time on our phone but it's the best way to tell the time.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.000]   If they can make a really good argument that it's more convenient to do these things on
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.040]   something small on your wrist then a lot of people who you know sure watch people probably
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.720]   have their Rolex as their panorise or whatever but there might be a lot of people who say
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.400]   I can leave my phone in the pocket I can get a bigger phone and leave it in my purse I can
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.320]   maybe issue a phone and just have a tablet and there'll be a whole bunch of new use cases
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   that I think we'll only figure out over the next year.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.800]   Yeah when I when I wrote my piece from the night after the event that was my lead paragraph
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.680]   that I don't think that Apple has ever made a product like this before where there is
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.880]   no preceding successful product that they could then put their own exclamation point
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.280]   at the end of that sentence maybe even have go all the way back to the Apple 2 Plus because
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.720]   there weren't really home computers before until they basically there was an example
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.920]   of a successful home computer and then they built one with the Macintosh there are already
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.880]   desktop computers not something as good with the GUI even the iPod we've got the disc
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.160]   man we've got the Walkman portable music players so people are were already seated with all
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.400]   that information about here's the sort of role in your life this is going to play I can't
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.720]   remember that even the iPad I think didn't have that place where we know you don't you've
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.360]   never owned something like this you've never you don't know somebody who owns something
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.400]   like this right now but we're going to convince you that this is something that you want and
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.280]   need which is I think is an unusual place for Apple to be.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.760]   Well how about the rumors speaking of rumors because there are always a lot of rumors surrounding
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:48.240]   Apple products that we're going to see a new Mac mini updates when we possibly get the
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.040]   new iPad announcement which is obviously not official yet but October 21st seems to be
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.400]   the going date for everybody if that indeed was going to happen new Mac mini hasn't been
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.760]   refreshed in what two years almost two years.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.720]   You're going to have a Sarah forever forever.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.760]   Anything after 1.5 years is basically forever I agree with you.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.720]   I've never had a Mac mini myself I know that there are Mac mini loyalists a lot of them
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.320]   I like to use it for their media management connected to televisions.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.280]   I'm casting a few friend yeah exactly few friends of mine got Mac minis in their kitchen
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   with a little monitor it yeah it's it's it seems to be the computer that if you've got
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.480]   one you think oh yeah this is really really helpful but again it's not necessarily the
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.440]   computer that I've ever needed.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.080]   So I have to in my house okay so I definitely my Mac mini fan and it has been sad that it
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.000]   hasn't been updated it's definitely not for everybody but it's actually if you don't want
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.480]   to buy an iMac if you don't want to get an iMac with the screen and the whole thing and
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.560]   you just want a computer to attach to an external display yeah your choices are Mac mini
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.480]   or Mac Pro unless you know or or by laptop but I mean there is there's a place for it
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.120]   I've got one behind my TV it is attached to a bunch of storage and it's where I put all
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   my music and movies and stuff and then the old one of that is in my is in my son's room
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.820]   and he uses a deploy minecraft and and they're great and in fact I want to buy one because
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.120]   I have a Mac book air that I use attached to a monitor at my desk and I actually realized
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.840]   that a Mac mini a nice Mac mini would have more power and I actually would like to park
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.160]   one there so I'm looking forward to it if they do update it.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.400]   Yeah it's a really important product because last we've all been we've just been discussing
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.880]   about it for 30 seconds to a minute and we've talked about at least five different unique
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.360]   you use cases for it people who want to use it just as a media server people who want
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.080]   a spare computer in a certain room or another people that I almost all the time when you
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.840]   go into someone's server room you will see these racks and racks of blade servers but
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.000]   there's always one Mac mini I find somewhere in that stack because that's what the admin
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.760]   wants to use to administrate all that's all that hardware I'm using one for podcasting
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   right now it's also the cheapest point of entry into Mac OS given that so many people
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.080]   will have something that they can plug a VGA cable into and you can get you know God
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.120]   well if Tuesday if trash day is Tuesday morning when Monday night at 10 p.m. you can have as
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.840]   many mice and keyboards as you want so there's no less expensive way to get into Mac than
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.320]   a Mac mini so it's kind of disappointed be disappointing if Apple were to give up on
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.680]   it and that's the exact reason why I don't think they are giving up on it.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.320]   How do you think Apple feels about Jason as you described it's great for media management
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.160]   music movies that sort of thing that kind of competes with Apple TV itself.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   Well it does and it's not for everybody but this is like the Mac mini seems to be a product
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.480]   with a whole bunch of little niche uses so this is why it hasn't been updated in two
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.360]   years it's not a high priority for Apple but I think it's nice to have around and you know
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   Apple kept the iPod classic around for ages when it was sort of like very few uses were
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.680]   left for it and the Mac mini has a lot of uses but it's but you know not every product
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.200]   that Apple makes has to be a super mainstream product and I think that's what where the Mac
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.320]   mini is it fills in it gives them flexibility in the Mac product line rather than just saying
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.480]   okay you got a bio laptop and iMac or a Mac Pro it gives them another product it's
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.520]   the lowest priced Mac there are lots of lots of reasons why keeping it around is great
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.000]   but it's you know I wouldn't ever argue that it should be Apple's focus and it clearly isn't
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   Apple's focus that's why it hasn't been updated since 2012 I think yeah yeah alright well then
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.600]   the next question becomes okay so what does get refreshed exactly if we don't have until
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   Broadwell processors that are available until are are doing yeah I mean the last I heard this
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.840]   is not happening until 2015 because it's been they've been delayed for a variety of reasons
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.600]   but you figure well there's really no point in being like new Mac mini's with Haswell processors
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.000]   that are impressive to anybody anymore for if you run the Mac book errors far as I understood
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.760]   was all was at least the recent version was always built on Broadwell and it was just
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.640]   Broadwell delays that was keeping it from market and as we saw with the original Mac book
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.520]   air and other things Apple has been good at getting chipsets as fast as Intel to make
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.720]   them off and ahead of other manufacturers and if they could do that again with a retinomac
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.360]   book air that would be terrific if Intel is really delaying them and that goes in 2015
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.880]   then that's really sad because they have a lot of you know there's rumors of 4k or 5k iMacs
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.920]   or retinomac as well and a lot of that hinges on all the technology that has to go to support
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.520]   that many pixels at you know on a Mac book error at that you know small size with that
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.920]   good battery life on an iMac just driving all those pixels and people complain that Apple
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.560]   is too controlling but it's often the parts of the of the chain that they don't control
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.920]   that ends up causing a little bit of dissatisfaction if ever there was a Mac that Apple would release
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.480]   with the about to be eclipsed Intel processor family it's the Mac mini so it wouldn't shock
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.320]   me it would be kind of sad but it wouldn't shock me if they said yeah well we updated
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   the Mac mini here it is and it was a well Mac mini it was just using has while yeah wouldn't
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.440]   shock me it would be sad what if we're the what if they would have to accompany it by
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.200]   a hundred dollar price drop would that soften the blow a little bit yeah i mean i don't know
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.280]   what Apple's thinking for this product right i mean when it first came out it was $4.99
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.840]   which was amazing and then the next year they sort of stepped away and said yeah $5.99
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.520]   let's try that but there's room in there it would be interesting to see i think Apple
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.320]   knows exactly who's using this product i think and what they're using it for and they may
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:31.720]   just decide look you know this is it's going to be better than the than the existing chips
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.240]   that are in there because it's two years old and it never went as well at this it's
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.640]   interesting to think what broadwell broadwell has a lot of advantages for a retina macbook
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:48.040]   care what their advantages are for a mac mini is harder to determine well i think in a few
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   minutes we should probably start talking about bendy phones because i know you're all
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:59.600]   ready to do that but first let's take a quick break to thank hover.com for sponsoring this
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.640]   episode of mac break weekly if you've got a great idea for you know on website or you
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.880]   need a blog or whatever you need a domain well okay where you go you want something
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.320]   catchy you want a good good good good memorable name you want it to represent you in some
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.800]   way that's what hover is so good for it gives you exactly what you need to get your domain
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.280]   get it secured and get on with whatever creative project you want to attach to it you need
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.000]   that perfect domain so right now is a great time to start a new project because hover recently
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.160]   lowered prices on over 200 domain extensions including many top level domains they also
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.720]   reduce the price for new dot com domain names now 1299 plus who is privacy is included for
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.160]   free on every domain that supports it people love hover geeks love hover developers love
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.840]   hover designers programmers people of hover because they know that they have good tools
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.240]   and they have good support you don't have to be some sort of a tech expert to get a domain
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.040]   it's very very easy to use hover search a few keywords hover will show you the best available
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.120]   options maybe you got an idea for domain let's see if it's available well maybe it isn't
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.520]   maybe it is but maybe it isn't maybe there's something similar that hover could suggest
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.280]   to you and you go oh yeah okay all right what are you doing Chad you looking for my name
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.760]   let's see what hover wants but certainly not comments and available because I own it but
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.160]   hey we've got some other stuff certainly not biz I'm missing out sir it leaned out today
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.120]   that's kind of fun certainly not global it's a little bit weird it's a really not pro
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.160]   yeah and and the list goes on obviously that would be a really weird domain for you to
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.280]   have but it'd be kind of fun for me to have hover also offers valet transfer service you
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.200]   might be using another domain register lots of people are you switch over to have hover
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.240]   and it's a pain list process for free hover takes care of the entire process for you and
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.720]   let's you know when your domains are nice and settled in in your hover account they also
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:06.000]   transfer all your DNS settings I have sometimes been in DNS hell here or there because you
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.440]   make one little wrong move and then it's very confusing hover does all that for you no matter
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.200]   how many domain names you have it's no additional cost best customer service support no wait
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.080]   no hold no transfer phone service and hover also offers volume discounts that means that
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.040]   they give you a discount on your domain renewals which starts at 10 domains and then goes up
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.360]   and value from there so so they kind of throw you a bone if you're actually managing a larger
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.800]   amount of domains and some of us are visit hover today to register your domain name and
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:46.440]   little extra 10% off your first purchase h o v e r dot com that's hover dot com and use

[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.880]   thanks so much to hover for the support of Mac break weekly I'm Sarah Lane filling in
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.400]   for a little report here on Mac break weekly this weekly is off in London where I am joined
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.480]   by in person Jason Snell of course to to my left Andy not go and then of course Renee
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.720]   Richie sitting in America's hat there you guys must get so sick of saying things like that
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.280]   no you took Justin Bieber off her hands we're good there you go there you go yeah he almost
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.200]   fits better in the US which you know what does that what does that say about all of
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.840]   us so I mentioned before the break and thanks all of you gentlemen for joining me today before
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:38.640]   the break I said we should probably talk about the whole bendy phone crisis which apparently
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:45.360]   is a lot less of a crisis than perhaps Samsung would have us believe Renee your phone does
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:52.400]   not look bendy I have had this in my non hipster jeans for going on 14 days I've sat down
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.860]   with it I've run around with it I've done everything I can humanly do with it it is
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.720]   still straight this is a six or a six plus this is a six plus I have a six on my other
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.320]   pocket oh that is also it's great now when you say pockets and you say sitting you're
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.960]   talking about front pockets or back pockets or pockets I'm not an animal well I don't
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:15.560]   know I'm a I don't I have a six plus here which if anybody watches my show I five you
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:22.480]   know that I have a lot of buyers remorse even though it was Leo's money I still have
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.760]   remorse because it's too large for me but I wouldn't dream of even trying to put it
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.960]   in a pocket because I don't have pockets that fit phones in general maybe a blackberry
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.080]   pearl would fit in one of my front pockets but we're not really doing that anymore all right
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.360]   Jason you got the six here you got the six which is so significantly smaller than the
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.600]   six plus it's unbelievable but I mean is it fitting comfortably in your pocket yeah
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.400]   you have it yeah I haven't even I haven't noticed a difference but it's not the six plus I mean
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.680]   that's I'm used to the five S in my pocket so it's not that it's not that different does
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:03.760]   everybody carry phones in their pockets I have pockets yeah I mean I've got pockets I've just
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:10.360]   never thought to put shove a phone so Ben Thompson who does a stratecary did he was in Taiwan
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.800]   and he I mentioned this on Twitter actually a couple weeks ago he says that we know that
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.160]   large phones are very big in Asia this is that's the market where the galaxy notes have had
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.480]   the most success and when I was talking to Apple about the six plus they definitely said
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.040]   there are certain regions that really love huge phones in Asia is the biggest one and
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.120]   what Ben Thompson said is people who have these big phones generally do not put them
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.440]   in their pockets they have a bag and it lives in the bag and then they take it out and use
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.040]   it and then put it back in the bag and you know there's also obviously some cultural
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   stuff at work here but I think that's an interesting thing that we here in the US especially
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.560]   being used to these smaller phones and they's because they sell better here I think are
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.280]   used to putting them in our pockets and big phones maybe don't work in pockets so well
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.240]   so we're Americans we got big pants for a big but so we got pockets that can hold
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.600]   stuff pockets but yeah I found I've been carrying around both of them pretty much daily no no
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.480]   bendy problems yet that doesn't mean that I absolutely discount the experiences that
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.200]   some people have been having the only thing that I've been finding that little bit disappointing
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.080]   about some of the commentary is that every time there's someone says yeah well I was
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.200]   carrying it in a pocket and when looked at bent after a couple of days the immediate
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.000]   responses oh see it's just stupid people doing stupid things with their phones because
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.480]   they're idiots let's wait a minute if I'm sure it's I don't think it's an epidemic problem
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   or else we'd be seeing a lot more reports within this but let's wait a few weeks until
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.760]   we see what happens I think I do think that you have to make a deliberate choice for the
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.000]   six plus you really shouldn't just get it because it's bigger and it's fancier because
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.120]   even I I mean that there I'm in the habit of carrying my phone in my shirt pocket because
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.200]   it's easily accessible and when I was I spent a really wonderful day on Sunday walking around
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.920]   with both these phones just eight miles covering most of Boston just taking pictures and I
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.440]   had to make sure that I did not keep my six plus in my shirt pocket because I was had a
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.160]   kind of a little it was a little bit shallow and boy you just put about 17 degrees of flex
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.400]   in my waist and that thing is almost certainly going to be tumbling out because it's so
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.920]   a top heavy off of this pocket so I mean you're right sir I mean it's it's going to be way
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.840]   too big for a lot of people and it's a shame that some people might have just gone for
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:29.040]   their gut instinct for the larger phone when the iPhone 6 is plenty big it's almost a
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.960]   I almost I almost considered a perfect size if you don't have a fancy for a smaller sized
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.680]   phone enough screen real straight to make it an extra screen real estate to make it
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:44.840]   worth a while but small enough that you can really conceal it pretty well yeah I I I thought
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.800]   that the whole let's get the six plus even though it's ridiculous because I'm a pretty
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.400]   small person and I certainly don't have big hands would be just a sort of a fun experiment
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.840]   especially because as as as you guys were mentioning there are certain markets where
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:04.120]   the larger phablet sized phones I don't know phablet is about it on the show or not but
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.880]   you know what I mean are do sell well people like them there are different accessories
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.320]   for carrying these phones maybe it's not so dependent on being in your pocket well my
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.720]   phone was never in my pocket to begin with so that part of it doesn't really bother
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.640]   me I've got some sort of like a handbag or a or a shoulder bag or something usually
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:30.880]   with me but it's it's so comically large that it's I'm going to get used to it I have gotten
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.160]   you sort of the last 10 days but it's not getting any easier I can never use it with
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.760]   one hand not as enjoyable as you hoped can I ask you have you been you were primarily
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.240]   an iOS user to begin with you weren't using Android phones never okay I think that's
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.040]   part of the issue that's part of it I mean if it's still too big it's still too big I
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.880]   think that the reason why six plus could be really really jarring for people who are
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.640]   moving up from an iPhone 5 is because they haven't had the chance like me to transition
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.600]   through where this if you'd shown if I'd move straight to this from an iPhone 4 this would
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.920]   have looked freaking huge whereas this looks like just oh it's a little bit on the large
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.840]   side that's not huge and so to go from this to a phablet size phone a 5.5 in screen the
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.800]   five the iPhone plus still is pretty big even for me but it doesn't seem quite so shocking
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.120]   but you're right I mean even there's I was taking lots and lots of pictures that's the
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.480]   whole point of my taking that walk on Sunday and even for me it was wow there's so many
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.640]   times where especially when you're just taking a casual shot I have I've got a drink in my
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.960]   hand I'm walking through Quincy market now I really have to put that drink down because
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:39.040]   we're asked that you've got a shot at one handing a camera like this the six plus if
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.760]   that thing is going to go right onto those cobblestones and break into smithereens if
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.960]   you even try it so I think a case is going to be is absolutely important for for the
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.560]   iPhone 6 plus for everybody yeah I actually I usually am anti case I just like to feel
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   the phone the way that it is and it you know it's thinner that way and and for the first
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.560]   time I think I'm a hazard I'm a walking hazard because it's all about juggling now you know
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:08.640]   can I can I reach my thumb over what I noticed and this is probably it says something about
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   the fact that I take too many walks at night and I live in a somewhat dangerous neighborhood
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.360]   of San Francisco but I find that I feel very conspicuous yes yeah when I'm you know I've
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.120]   got my phone out and I'm doing something not that the iPhone 5s which was my last iPhone
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   was invisible by any means but you could almost kind of tuck it in here if you just
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.080]   sort of think I got to hide it for a second or dip it into a pocket for a minute this
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.520]   doesn't go anywhere I feel like I'm it's sort of like rob me holding a billboard yes
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.560]   take my phone make expensive phone well with that big battery it's going to hurt a lot
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.840]   more when you throw it at someone's face that's right there's an upside there you go yes
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.160]   it's a weakness and a weapon go back to the bending thing for a second because a lot of
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.440]   people made fun of it a lot of people are really upset about it a lot of people made fun of
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.080]   it there's like this YouTube culture versus apple blogger culture war going on about
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.400]   it and it's a little silly to me because it shows that people have trouble holding two
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.280]   truths you know can exist at the same time back with antenna gate there absolutely was
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.800]   a problem that if you were in a low signal area and you touched a certain part of the
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.240]   phone you could detune the signal you didn't have to touch that part of the phone and once
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.160]   you understood the physics behind it you were fine but it took a little bit of education
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.800]   in time and Apple adapted to it with the iPhone Verizon iPhone 4 and the 4s and this is similar
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.040]   you have a very thin piece of aluminum and it's very thin because apple realized that
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.520]   it's not thin for thin sake a lot of people want it to be thicker it's thin because it makes it
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.600]   lighter in the same way with the iPad 2 and the iPad Air bigger things when they're lighter or
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.240]   easier for human beings to use to hold up for long period time but when you have this sort of
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.520]   this relationship here with the phone there's the volume buttons and there's a bolt right before
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.960]   those volume buttons with a titanium and steel reinforcement stop so if you apply pressure to
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:58.640]   that to the cut out area where the volume is in that bolt meet you can you can buckle the structure
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.000]   that's something that you can understand and you know pay attention to be careful with if it's
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.400]   something you think you'll do put a case on it's not the same as people just bending the phones for
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.800]   jokes on YouTube which is horrible or going into stores and bending it but it's something that
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.160]   it exists because of physics because you have an object that has certain structural areas and
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.720]   again for me it's just that you understand what the problem is or understand what the physics are
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:27.040]   and then take good care of the stuff that you bought. I think that was not an analogy that I 100%
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:33.600]   agree with because antenna gate was a real problem I experienced that like day one I literally I
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.440]   literally had it out of the packaging that it had come in 20 minutes earlier fired it up had a
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.200]   SIM card in it and I was watching wow I had four bars before why is there now one bar and
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:52.000]   some people deny it some people deny it was an issue exactly exactly with with with I won't even
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.960]   call it bend gate but the issue that some people are having with bending I agree that it seems to
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.680]   be very quite isolated it doesn't seem to be an epidemic I don't believe that it's a design fault
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:08.560]   but I'd the only the only complicity if that's the even inappropriate word that apple has is that
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.520]   I think that there are going to be a lot of people who likes are having their first really really big
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:19.680]   phone after years and years of having what are now a small phone by smartphone standards and it's
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.160]   they're doing they're they're only guilty of doing what with their phones the things that they always
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.440]   do with their phones which is to take really good care we care of them and try to prevent them from
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.640]   getting damaged unbeknownst to them knowing that well a larger phone has different rules now and
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   they're added risks that your smaller phone did not have so I hope that this will die down I was
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:47.040]   very first amused and then kind of saddened by the fact that I after about six or seven hours of
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.680]   walking around the city using my iPhone 6 plus and now they're still new enough and rare enough
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.200]   that hey is that the new iPhone 6 and two or three times I got asked is it bending on you I said no
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:04.320]   it's not bending on me it's perfectly fine it's not a cloud as well it just never got as much media
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.400]   attention but you ask anybody you were did any form of iPhone repairs at all including apple
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.680]   geniuses and they would tell you they would get people coming in and around the volume area
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.080]   some people managed to bend the phone because six yeah actually Anthony Nielsen who's one of our
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.920]   editors I mentioned yeah I met a joke about bending iPhone 6s and he said he pulled out his
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.480]   iPhone 5s and said look yeah it's I mean it's not bent in half but you can see a small little ridge
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:34.720]   from I guess sitting on it for the last year or so apple says only nine people actually have
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.680]   complained about this I don't know exactly where you get that official number it must be a certain
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.560]   way that somebody sent in a complaint to to apple support but consumer reports of course
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.600]   got on the bandwagon and and and did some testing is the iPhone 6 plus for example any weaker than
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:59.200]   other competitors in that class of smartphone uh consumer report says the iPhone 6 plus the more
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.160]   robust of the new iPhones in our testing started to deform when we reached 90 pounds of force
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.880]   and came apart with 110 pounds of force with those numbers it slightly outperformed the HTC one
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.400]   which is largely regarded regarded as a sturdy solid phone as well as the smaller iPhone 6 yet
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   underperformed some other smartphones and goes on to mention the LG G3 the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:29.120]   now we're talking about you know 90 pounds of force you're not talking about like gingerly like
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.040]   oh sorry my phone was in my back pocket whoops okay let me put it on the table let's hit flat
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.960]   phones Sarah yeah I mean this is where it's this this is I mean that's that happening very often
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.600]   it just can't be for 10 million phones sold of which we don't know how many
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.800]   are iPhone 6 plus but I'm betting it's more than nine uh that's a that's a low number even for apple
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.280]   to report so I'm not worried yeah it's it's oh it's almost like saying um my phone fell in the
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:01.360]   toilet because it was in my back pocket because it was so small I forgot it was there thanks for
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.520]   nothing apple well like Andy said I think it's worth uh I love that Andy is canceling patience
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   here because over time and with more of these out there we'll find out whether there is a was
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:19.760]   there a manufacturing flaw is there's just a weakness in every model is this common or not
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.600]   and my guess is that if there if some phones do have this problem apple will probably have a
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.000]   policy and they'll replace them and they'll you know they'll do something but right now it seems
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.480]   like such a small case that unless you're really trying to get attention um you're very not very
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.240]   likely to to see a problem here and then we'll just have to see how it goes but I do think it's
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.560]   fair to say that in a few months we'll have a much better idea the internet doesn't want to wait a
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.520]   few months for anything but we will have a better idea whether this is a serious problem or just
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.600]   another kind of oddball thing that happens when a new iPhone comes out every year Jason there's
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:01.280]   something there's always something there's always something like my grandma grandma we mentioned it
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:09.360]   uh earlier in the show that there was there was a small window of uh of iOS 8.0.1 uh I think what
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:15.040]   was pulled about an hour and a half after being pushed out it was yeah 80 minutes yep it was
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:23.600]   it was 80 minutes I counted good work I had not um installed the update so I was unaffected and I
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.280]   got to just sort of sit back with some popcorn and watch twitter have a meltdown and then regroup
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.680]   so that's always it's always fun to be an outsider in those situations and think I'm so glad I wasn't
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.320]   one of the first uh how about how long all of you I was one of the first absolutely I mean but
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.600]   that's sort of our jobs right just try this stuff so I did it and uh and I think Renee and I had a
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.240]   whole back and forth on twitter as we're both updated and said yep cell service is gone touch
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.280]   ideas gone and everybody else who uh what had installed it started chiming in and then it turned
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.440]   out very quickly that it was just the sixes that seemed to be affected fives didn't seem to be
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.160]   affected and Renee did we finally figure out that it was also only if you did it over the air yeah
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.120]   the the binary was fine it was only the bit differential file for the on if you did it on device
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.960]   which is a crazy problem to have yeah yeah so that that's stunk and uh it was interesting to
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.560]   watch how apple rolls back a mistake like this because they haven't really done this
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.000]   very often if ever that I can remember uh the first thing they did and this is actually very
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.480]   clever the first thing they did is stop signing the update and what that means is at the end after
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.600]   you download it your device any of these apple software updates your device checks with the server
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.240]   to see if the signature matches to basically like so it it can't be vulnerable to a an attack
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.000]   where a fake software update is sent to you and that it that can take over your phone um and they
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.320]   will often turn off signing for older versions of the operating system so you can't roll back
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   so what they did is they turned off signing for this so people would download the update
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.960]   some of them in the process of downloading the update and then it would say some weird error
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:00.080]   like you're not on the internet I got one that said like device is not authorized oh boy and it
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.320]   was it was weird but what it was really doing is saying I'm not going to install this so they did
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:11.200]   that first and then uh about ten minutes later if you were on an uh an a point o device and you
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.840]   checked for software update it said you've got the latest version so they they eventually
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.800]   rolled it all the way back and then I think later the next day they pushed out 802 so it was an
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.080]   interesting uh process of like how long did it doesn't take apple to stop the flow of software
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.520]   updates and it was I think pretty impressive that it only took them about 80 minutes to to shut it
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.040]   completely down but not without I can imagine just a lot of confusion from people who
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:43.040]   sure or 40 000 service apple said there were 40 000 people affected out of 10 million new iPhone
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.680]   sixes and iPhone six pluses which isn't which by no means is trivial and there were some people
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.680]   who said I don't I never use touch ID and never make phone calls so I didn't even notice I managed
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:58.320]   to downgrade to iOS 8.0.0 and then reinstall it then downgrade then actually install the binary
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:06.080]   for iOS 8.1 and that 8.0.1 and that worked fine um but yeah it's like sorry it was really I agreed
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:12.800]   Jason it was so impressive I was away at meetings that afternoon uh and it was out and then pulled
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.000]   by the time I was aware of it and was ready to start downloading it my my backup theory is that
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.440]   maybe this is more more genius apple marketing where they're trying to do now limited edition
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.840]   releases like mondo gallery prints where it's only available if you download it for the next
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:33.600]   80 minutes that only 40 000 people will get it so if you have the 8.0.1 release put that put that
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.840]   in a ziplock bag phone and then put it on eBay because it's going to be worth something someday
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:43.760]   I have waited already I guess I guess I can see someone saying oh I didn't have to make a phone
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:49.360]   call on those couple of hours sure so yeah it wasn't really better but the touch ID that's what
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.080]   I noticed when I rebooted that that in itself is a big deal because yeah if you need to make a
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.560]   phone call during that hour oh yeah yeah if you're if your dad just had a stroke yeah that's a really
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.760]   bad scene definitely you had to roll back you had to go to iTunes and download the iOS 8 install and
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.400]   then write do an update in place using iTunes on the computer to fix it during that one day period
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.240]   which is not it's also non-trivial for people who aren't very comfortable we don't even remember
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.360]   the age before iCloud when you had to do that all the time to update yeah well they'll do the
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:26.800]   next one on DVD or CD I'll mail you a 40 floppies are there are there people who prefer to not use
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.240]   touch ID when given the option I mean it's one of the best things ever invented as far as I'm
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.000]   concerned but but I also hate you know typing in my password every time I want to install an app
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.200]   for example I heard a lot of people right after the 5s came out say that they were turning it off
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.600]   and the software you know they made some software tweaks to make it work better that's true it works
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.160]   so great now I I never have a problem unless I did like doing the dishes or something in my hands
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.760]   exactly a wet sometimes at the gym if I'm sweaty enough I'm like oh yeah otherwise it just works and
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.400]   with and with iOS 8 now you can unlock all sorts of other stuff too which makes it that much more
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.440]   valuable like unlocking one password with my thumbprint is so great we had a big discussion
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.480]   about this on vector yesterday because Jesse char formerly of apple formerly pacific helm said
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.720]   that her fingerprints just never read with it for some reason it just never works she's a
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.440]   replicant she might be and George is the way you're cutting logo in the middle of the fingertip that's
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   throwing it off I'm betting she said that she never uses it because for her it's a form of
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.280]   identification and right now with a passcode you know someone else can use your passcode can use
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.800]   your phone consent something but if she ever sends somebody a nasty text it's now got her
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.440]   fingerprint proves that she was the one who sent it to her it's entirely a culpability argument
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:42.240]   interesting weird weird fingerprint issues interesting I love touch I do because I put a hard
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.320]   password on my phone then instead of a four digit code there you go I never wanted to enter in a
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.400]   long password every single time I unlocked but now that I got touch ID I only have to do that when
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.040]   I reboot and so it's great and even then I would say and that doesn't happen that often you
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.480]   sometimes I run out of batteries because I'm not paying attention or something but even then it's
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:04.960]   always like yeah yeah that's right my phone restarted now I've been typing my password like
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:10.400]   some sort of a lot I'd yeah there's a legal issue though because I believe in American Lost
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.720]   Dile you can be compelled to use your fingerprint but not compelled to use a passcode so to give
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.600]   up a passcode so some people just strictly for legal reasons won't enable touch ID and that's an
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.120]   interesting point because I actually read the justification behind that because your passcode
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.080]   is information that you know that you cannot be compelled to say but the fingerprint is just a
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.160]   physical thing and you don't have to actually tell anybody what it is and so that's the legal
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.320]   position that they on the basis that you they can compel you to unlock something with a
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:46.240]   fingerprint on a passcode the law is amusing as hell is it not amusing for sure as anybody
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:52.080]   played around with any of the apps that have been updated to support health kit this is this is
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:59.840]   all in the last week or so this was enabled by 8.0.1 and then enabled again by 8.0.2 right exactly yeah
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:06.160]   I feel like I I'm seeing press releases breathless press releases about oh the you know the the
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:13.600]   fitness app will now talk to the health app and keep all your data in one place I don't know maybe
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:21.280]   it says something about the fact that I'm not very fitness oriented but I have yet to find it to be
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:28.400]   a killer service for me yet but you know these are early days too I know I haven't seen anything
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:33.440]   yet none of the apps that I use have have updated to support the health app yet so I was just checking
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.160]   and there's nothing in there nothing in there I think you know at some point Apple said this was
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:43.200]   gonna happen about a month after release when they had this kind of a mess up that prevented a lot
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:49.680]   of the stuff from working and then they released it with 8.0.1 and so I wonder if the developers are
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.960]   all like come on Apple I'm still working on it I don't know it's gonna take time like like a lot
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.720]   of these things it's gonna take time for all the apps are absolutely I feel it the same way about
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.840]   iOS 8 where I don't think people are I don't think that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been officially
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.080]   released for until December or January when not only developers have a chance to update their
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.320]   stuff to work with these phones but also that they themselves have had time with these new phones
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:19.600]   these new technologies that as users they can decide oh I thought that academically back in August I'd
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.240]   want my app to behave this way but actually it makes more sense for it to interact like this so it's
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   going to be pretty exciting come January I think I'm yeah I'm I'm excited to use apps that can
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:37.680]   somehow take advantage of at least keeping health data in one place but health data is still
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   right health kit is still kind of rough like when you install an app that uses health kit
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.960]   apples got really really good privacy protection so you can choose send and receive for every single
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.600]   function of that app but that's leading to these page long toggle sheets that you just get presented
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.640]   with almost like a wall of permissions when you first start and the developers have found bugs
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.480]   in some of the things and they have having trouble addressing them and you have multiple devices
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.120]   you have to set up like are you gonna let your your jawbone up communicate your steps are you
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.200]   gonna let the chip in your phone do it you're gonna let them know about each other it seems like this
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.360]   is a technology I still sort of coalescing and it'll take a few months before we have really good
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.200]   health kit apps we also really know how to use it and apples sort of really understands what
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.640]   developers and weird doing so they can make it all work better for us and this also goes far beyond
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:28.800]   just fitness and mobility if you drill down into that menu structure and see all of the fine grain
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.440]   health data that this can collect and manage and organize for you if you've ever been the caretaker
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.400]   for someone who is critically ill you know that you really there's there's information that you need
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.160]   to track on an hourly and a daily basis and only by collecting that data over a period of days and
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.760]   weeks and sometimes even months do you figure out like if you if you're suddenly taking care of
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.160]   someone who is an insulin dependent diabetic this is a problem that I was having when I was taking
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.440]   care of my mom where it took a couple of weeks to figure out how to manage her sugar perfectly so
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.360]   she if she gets a snack at exactly this time of the night she will not have a problem I want to make
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.440]   sure that do another check at this time of day and that was the sort of stuff that only happened
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:09.600]   because I kept an old power book on the kitchen table with a spreadsheet that did nothing but
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.760]   collect this data that I was inputting and so when you look at this sort of data that could be not
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.080]   just collected by the fact that you're walking around but also if you imagine it imagined as part of
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.760]   a house that has different health devices inside it that now communicate with this and feed all this
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.400]   information saying well the patient the the the the individual was moving from these times of the
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.160]   day to this other time of day here is what their blood chemistry was like here is what their
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.080]   oxygen take was like that's going to be the the really wonderful and beneficial part of this is
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:42.000]   going to be when you just simply take a phone out of your pocket and glance at this graph and you
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.680]   see correlations that you did not see before only by virtue the fact that this data has no one
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.720]   localized place to land and a really cool user interface to present itself so the certainly the
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.480]   features that everybody's going to be looking at and be most familiar with is how many steps
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.280]   that I walk how many calories that I consume what was my heart rate if I have a heart rate monitor
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.600]   but there are going to be a small percentage of the users out there they're going to get the
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.800]   greatest benefit of all because those are the people who really needed health kit.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:15.360]   Yeah I think probably the day to day how many calories did I burn? You know the novelty of that
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.400]   is going to wear off for a lot of people even if you have got good intentions kind of like going
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:25.600]   on a diet most of the time you end up losing interest and it's not actually data that's going
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.560]   to work that well for you because your behaviors you know you can't just change them overnight
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:37.680]   because you've got some tools. Even though that is cool too because as you can get I do take
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.840]   constitutional's two to four times a week I know it's not like I spent all my time inside the house
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.480]   doing doing getting all my exercise from the risks downward but it's only I tried to I tried
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.880]   to health ban for a while at some point you misplaced where the charger is because you come home from a
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.960]   trip and so it takes you two days to find it and then after two days you kind of left the
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.160]   we got out of the habit of keeping this thing on your wrist at all times.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.480]   Rassafone is something you always have on you you always have with you so it can really do a good
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.680]   job of monitoring your activity and like I was saying earlier once you have all this incidental
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.640]   data that's being collected where you weren't even really interested in this as a project of using
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:18.480]   data to improve my health but you accidentally are just out of board curiosity because your
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.640]   bus is late you finished your last Kindle book you look at this data and it can show you that oh
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.160]   well here are the days when I just don't seem to leave the house I don't seem to do a lot of
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.320]   activity and here are days where I seem to be very very active I need to be more active on these
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:35.840]   days I'll tell you one quick story about I was doing maintenance of my my google account which
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.520]   is something that you should do often the google collects a lot of information but the good thing
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.840]   that about the way they do it is that it's all on one page they're very upfront here's all the
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.600]   information we've got on you you can take a look at the data yourself if you don't want us to
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:51.200]   collect this data not only can you stop us from doing that but you can also delete the data that's
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:56.240]   there and was only looking at some my my movement data tracking like where where I happen to go with
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:03.600]   my phone that I realized that okay so you left the house on Sunday good you didn't leave the house
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:09.920]   Monday or Tuesday you left the house briefly to go to the store one mile away on Wednesday
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.640]   didn't leave the house Thursday left the okay you know Andy maybe you should just like put shoes
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.840]   on more often of course I know you're a freelancer but use this this this indicates something that
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.800]   in your if you correct this in your 40s your doctor will not be suggesting surgery in your 50s maybe
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:32.960]   yeah never thought about that they know they know a lot about your uh your how good of a
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:39.440]   sitter we are as in sitting on the couch bending our phones uh that's that's your kind of it
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.960]   takes energy to get off the couch we should get credit for that that barometer should say okay
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:48.240]   congratulations you went from 18 inches off the ground to do 43 inches that's a lot of momentum
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:56.560]   exactly the watch is gonna bug you to stand up yeah it's a it's a reverse squat that's hard exactly
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:02.080]   yeah just I'm just I'm just pacing myself that's all I did there you go uh let's take another
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.520]   uh quick break um we want to thank square space this time for sponsoring this episode of
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.320]   Mac break weekly squarespace.com if you don't use it I'm using squarespace for years is an all-in-one
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.040]   platform uh whether you you want to uh you know once you got your hover domain exactly then it's

[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   or online portfolio of some kind if you can just go to squarespace.com you can look through templates
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:39.280]   that they have as a jumping off point uh you know I'm not a designer I I wish I was I'm just not I
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.040]   never really know where to start I don't really feel like I understand color palettes and I'm not
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.000]   designing client squarespace has some really beautiful templates that you can just use to get
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.640]   started you just go ahead and and and and start building your website you know maybe you're
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:58.240]   you're pulling in data from somewhere else um but it is it is a really nice starting point um
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.720]   really impressive um I've even had fun just kind of switching around templates to see how all of
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:07.440]   my information looks different uh depending on which template I've used once you're once you're up
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.080]   and running the designs are beautiful and of course they're completely customizable you're not stuck
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.720]   with some template that you think oh this is really great but I don't really like the placement of
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:22.640]   this one column all of that stuff is customizable and it's easy to use squarespace has live chat
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:28.960]   and email support 24 hours a day seven days a week but in in many cases this is all very intuitive
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.480]   it's it's really designed for people who don't know that much about putting together a professional
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.600]   website if you do you're gonna love it already but if you don't you're not going to feel like

[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:04.480]   for their support of MAC break weekly a better web awaits you and it starts with your new squarespace
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:13.040]   website so uh fbi director james komi said last week i think it was last thursday that he was
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:20.320]   pretty concerned uh with some steps that companies like apple i think the the the following day google
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.680]   came out and said yeah we're gonna make sure that um data is encrypted so that uh in in a new way
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.760]   so that when the nsa comes knocking on our door we can say whoa whoa well we just we have zero
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:39.280]   access to any of that data um so as an apple consumer customer i can then feel a little bit more
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:46.640]   uh free to express myself if for some reason i was worried about that sort of thing um komi told
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:52.880]   reporters uh at a press conference about this subject quote i'm a huge believer in the rule of
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:58.880]   law but i also believe that no one in this country is beyond the law what concerns me about this is
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:06.320]   companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law okay i
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:13.200]   i believe that i can understand what director komi is getting out here clearly he works for the fbi
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.720]   so he has a vested interest in wanting as much information as possible and let's just say that
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:26.160]   hey they they're they're um you know uh if you if you think about uh the the bureau what they're
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:31.040]   trying to do is keep the good people say from the bad people well i'm sure the head of the chinese
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.240]   fbi and head of the russian fbi wants to say max as the head of the kongalese fbi i mean america
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.640]   is where apple is located but it is not by any means the only country in the world and sure i am
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.680]   happy that you know if the if the fbi probably doesn't want other security agencies to have
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.600]   access to the information and we live in a world where unfortunately if you let one person in you're
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.600]   letting everybody in so i'm much happier if all of them have to go knocking on personal doors and
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:58.400]   not some big server anymore yeah this is this is i mean you hear this from law enforcement all the
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.760]   time when the maranda decision came down that they were gonna for read people they're right they
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.160]   said oh god we're never gonna be able to arrest anybody ever again guess what they adapted it was
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.080]   fine this is one of those examples too where um these kind of policies really hurt american companies
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.680]   you know selling their products in foreign markets because um you know if you know that the american
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.200]   government holds the keys to the encryption to this product and you're in some other country you're
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.920]   like we can't use this product they're gonna be spying on us so i get the overarching idea that
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:32.480]   they want to protect us but using a back door getting an encryption key um especially given how
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.240]   the government has been approaching these tech companies and in secret for national security
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.600]   reasons and trying to get them to uh to set up back doors for them and and setting up monitoring
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.360]   within organizations like uh like apple and yahoo and google and microsoft and you name them
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.840]   i think that as a member of the public i i want apple to be in my corner and say look we're not
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:01.680]   gonna get between you and the government here and that was where apple was they held those keys and
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.120]   and and so apple it's like like saying you could be compelled to put your thumbprint on on your
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.360]   touch id scanner apple could be compelled to give that information up and apple and google both
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   saying look we don't want to get in this we don't want to hold the keys to your data to all our
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.320]   customers data i think that's uh that's fantastic and i think that law enforcement will adapt they
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.400]   always do yeah that's exactly right and also i'm sure i'm not the only person in the world certainly
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.200]   maybe not even the person in this conversation who found it that his choice of words very very
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.760]   chilling that the fact that i want to have a phone in which my data is secure means that i'm doing
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   something suspicious because he said that the only reason why you would want this is because you
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:47.040]   want to skirt the law uh the it's i mean it's what is his opinions on the fact that i go to office
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.800]   max and buy a shredder what's the what is the position on the fact that i've got a wood burning
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.640]   stove in my house and i could burn papers as you say no no you're not allowed to burn anything
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.080]   until we've given we've taken a look to make sure there's nothing we want to see on that
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.080]   i mean this is a very very important principle i mean i don't obviously i've never talked to
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.320]   anybody at that high level of law enforcement i have spoken to people at a lower level and
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.800]   their opinion is always that we believe that it is our responsibility to use every legal option
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.480]   that's available to us to as you say keep the bad people from harming the good people but we use
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:22.480]   as our guidance the fact that the people choose to make something illegal and but once that uh it's
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.280]   not as though the most the the law enforcement folks i've spoken to don't feel as though they have a
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.400]   god-given constitutional right to see everything that you do and have a their thumbprint on your
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.800]   pulse at every moment of the day so that's why it was very very chilling to hear him speak of
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.880]   to try to i think i think part of it was maybe a little bit of PR to try to poison the well of
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.840]   public opinion saying that there's only one reason why you would want encrypted data on your phone
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.800]   and that's because you're up to no good and to and to basically turn the public against this
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.000]   which is i if that's true is a is a really terrible thing it's also poorly timed because
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.080]   just a few weeks after we learn about how people who thought that their private photos were nicely
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:08.000]   and securely stored somewhere that if they that uh it was available because of password hacks and
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.560]   you know weaknesses in human engineering uh not weaknesses during the system whereas if they had
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:19.040]   simply had encrypted storage on all their data and handled it that way uh not that they were victims
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.160]   excuse me not that they're anything but victims of uh of a personal uh personal theft there
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.720]   but this is an extra step to say you know what we never know where our phone is going to end up
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.440]   we never know where our data is going to end up it's just prudent with all the people who want our
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.680]   credit card information that want our personal information but even want our photos if only for
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.880]   yucks uh the ability to control the flow of data on our phones and the security of data on our
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.600]   phones is going to be a fundamental thing we want in every device just as fundamental as a touch screen
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.800]   and there was a police uh association or police chief in one of the cities who immediately played
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.400]   the child pornography card which you know is is even more disturbing and an even quicker bell
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.960]   weather that's something pretty terrible is going on in the discussion yeah the uh the the classic
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.160]   line here i got a i got a point out john groover uh who when he posted a link to a story about this
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.840]   undering fireball the headline he used was fbi and police departments endorse apples full device
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:20.080]   encryption uh because the idea there is when they play the pedophile card you know that they have run
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.600]   out of arguments and are just trying to scare people into uh into taking their side because
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.920]   there's a bogeyman out there and whoo boo scary um and missing the larger issues and i think
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:37.360]   grouper nailed it so yeah yeah uh like i said maryanda is the best example here that that was the end
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.160]   of law enforcement in the what early 70s when that ruling came down that you had to read people
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.640]   their rights guess what law enforcement is doing fine well they wanted to take everybody's fingerprints
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.920]   and we're told they couldn't yeah we need everybody's fingerprints everybody's dna yeah yeah if you go
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.320]   to the spy museum in dc you will see a room that's a reconstruction or at least a few years ago
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.520]   a reconstruction of i think was a romanian secret police archive in which they were of mason jars
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.920]   filled with like identical pieces of white cloth uh because according to this exhibit the secret
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.800]   place was systematically collecting scents from as many people as they possibly could so that if
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.120]   they needed to track them down with dogs later on they could go get the jar get this cloth and get
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.000]   this and that's the sort of thing and the message from that is that realize that we you don't work
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.360]   we don't work for you you guys work for us so you better do what we want you to do or else
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.400]   and so that's why uh this is just one this is just one guy one powerful guy making one statement it
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.440]   has to be backed up by the people that he relies on for political power and funding and also really
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.080]   on as cynical as you can get or lies on us saying that's perfectly fine where we support you in this
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.360]   policy so it's it's not that we're not at armageddon yet but it's certainly a warning that
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.440]   this is going to be an even more important thing and that people who did not have encryption on
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.040]   their phones today are probably going to be more interested in encrypting their phones next month
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.840]   absolutely speaking of uh different options for phones this is kind of an interesting article
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:03.520]   that uh that i read actually great little graph that arse technica put up that shows
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:11.520]   competitors of the big smartphone competitors um employee accounts and that sam san has
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:19.680]   as far as full-time employees this is in 2013 275 000 and some change employees
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.880]   i mean compare that to let's say google which is i think by and large thought of as a pretty big
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:32.800]   company just just you know under 48 000 sam san has like five google there's a huge company like apples
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.880]   at apple retail which distort the numbers sam san makes oil rigs and toilets and
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:43.040]   half rice cookers and the fridge is everything well yeah sam san i mean they're processors for
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.240]   apples products they're talking about yeah sam san san in the picture universe they are by and
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.880]   large their logo is on everything yeah and apple every name is exactly right apples number now
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   includes all the people who work in apple retail i think a more telling graph would be the people
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.480]   who are working on you know the computer sector and the smartphone sector at you know essentially
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.800]   at the headquarters are doing development and those numbers would be probably a lot smaller for
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.840]   certainly for apple certainly for sam san and probably for all of them you know speaking of
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:18.240]   retail uh how do you think microsoft's new fifth avenue store will will do what it opens in mid
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:23.840]   2015 we're gonna line up there for windows 10 is that the point i mean i don't know i i you know i
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.920]   i i'm familiar with fifth avenue apple has a nice door in fifth avenue it's kind of known as a big
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:34.000]   shopping hub i could see so they're gonna be like a clear plastic pyramid or octagon or something
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.880]   is that what i would like you're not far off you're not far off Jason because there is like
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.720]   right across the street from the bollison street flagship apple store in boston you go into the
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:49.200]   prudential mall there is a microsoft store and it's like the bizarro world version of apple where
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:56.080]   the apple store is like deep the microsoft store is wide the the genius bar is the last thing you see
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.880]   in the apple store it's the first thing you encounter when you enter the microsoft store it is truly
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:06.160]   opposite day and also also opposite day in terms of how many people are actually there during the
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.200]   holiday season that's that's what it's like at my mall too it's the same thing um is that there's
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   an apple store that's packed and then there's a microsoft store that's not and they are they are
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.080]   it's like black is white and night is day and and uh it's fascinating but you know this is something
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:25.840]   that happens in retail i i mean the retail is real estate and and some people argue that star
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.840]   bucks became as successful as it did because they were really good at choosing real estate and um
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:37.040]   microsoft has done a smart shorthand because apple was so smart at picking real estate that
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.440]   microsoft looks at where apple stores are and says we should be there too and that that happens in
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.480]   retail in lots of sectors not just the one that we care about here which is the computer but it's
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:53.040]   funny or jason area yeah yeah so fifth avenue seems like a good place to be let's do that
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.040]   it seems like a good place to be but as andy mentions it's not necessarily i mean sure it's
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.320]   good to have a spot in a well trafficked area particularly for a holiday season although this
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:11.280]   store isn't going to open until mid next year sometime but i i i just wonder how much you know the apple
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.960]   store model um has worked so well for apple over the years but i think that's that's not just because
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.800]   it looks a certain way but it's because well everything and there is apple yeah you've got some third
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.080]   party you know headphones and and and and and her direction that sort of thing yeah really
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.480]   i might change a bit but you know something like microsoft which is all about oem's and partners and
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.320]   that sort of thing it's i don't know how because clearly microsoft would like to recreate the apple
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   store experience as a microsoft store that people want to go and hang out in and and you know that
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.840]   whole thing i just don't know if it's possible i don't know if you can do that no matter where
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.520]   you're putting in a store because the apple fifth avenue store was famous i don't know if it's still
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.560]   the case but it was famous for outperforming tiffany's in a spur per square foot ratio they were just
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.920]   making handover fist money and you have to wonder would microsoft operate it at a loss is this supposed
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:04.000]   to be a profitable business samson had an experience store where you could you couldn't even buy stuff
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.400]   you could just go in and see how the samson experience made you feel and that obviously was for marketing
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.960]   not for revenue generation so you wonder i i too have experienced these malls where you go in and
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.280]   there's an apple store and then across the path there's a microsoft store with big cut out words you have
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.720]   to step all awkwardly over to get into and very thick tablets on the displays it's it really is
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.080]   a different experience and i i don't know if it would be a successful one on that street i'm a
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:33.600]   little surprised that uh such a nadela didn't come in and rethink this and maybe maybe they have
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.760]   behind the scenes but going ahead with a fifth avenue store it seems like that microsoft really
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.480]   is committed to this retail concept and it could work i gotta be honest i'm actually surprised
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:48.240]   when i go into or walk past let's be honest walk past a microsoft store that there aren't more
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.720]   people in them because it's not it doesn't seem like a bad idea it does work for apple i don't
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.200]   know quite what microsoft is doing wrong or if it's just that the products that they have in the
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.080]   brand name of microsoft just doesn't bring people in because it's not a bad idea to showcase your
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.800]   partners and the products you make yourself like surface and xbox and bring that that worked really
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.200]   well for apple it's like once people see this stuff and pick it up they get excited about it and
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:17.600]   the microsoft stores i i don't know i don't have anything but anecdotes but all my anecdotes are
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:24.640]   that they're empty and it's weird because it's not as if the microsoft isle at best buy is a place to
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:31.360]   avoid there's something about it when you take away i guess the the brand variety it becomes a well
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.000]   what am i going to the microsoft store is way nicer than the isle at best buy it is i can make fun of
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.960]   it being not quite the apple store and being like a bizarro version of apple stores but it's not a
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:47.280]   bad store it's it's a nice well laid out kind of big aisles it's not like you're in a big box store
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.960]   but they're just not i'm a little surprised they're still doing them i guess is what i'm saying
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.640]   there's a weird thing i don't want to make them too much of a microsoft thing but like they just
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.200]   announced windows 10 or skipping windows nine and making windows like they they got rid of the
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.320]   word metro and there's there's these choices that they make in their general branding that i don't
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.040]   think are always they're always making them appreciated by the general mass is apple whether
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.960]   you love them or hate them their brand is iconic they have a very clear vision for it and that suits
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:21.040]   retail very well microsoft hasn't taken the xbox was terrific if they had built something around xbox
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.080]   and windows media center and put it all together windows phone into a beautiful sensible branding
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.600]   package x-phone xbox x-late maybe xos x-store whatever i think it would be much more digestible
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.840]   you get a lot more people involved right now it's uh there's that store for that thing that runs on
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.520]   that beige box at work that i didn't want to talk about right now and i i think that hurts them
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.200]   and a lot of them yeah i think you're right i think an xbox store if they were okay with gang gamers
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.040]   gamers in there all the time as opposed to people who are lining up to buy ten thousand
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.080]   dollar gold gold wristwatches um that that that would be a more focused idea i mean part of the
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:59.360]   problem for problem quote-unquote has always been for microsoft that their apple is the exciting
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.040]   company you go to because they do exciting things and you want to walk away from the thing you're
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.200]   using and use the thing that's made by apple because it's so stylish and so focused and
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.320]   so well designed and it works so very well um microsoft has always been a lot more like the company
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.880]   that simply provides clean drinking water to your house they're not exciting you might even
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.440]   not know what the brand is until you actually make the payment every single month but you use
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.200]   their product and service every single day and and they can be very very profitable that way uh the
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:33.920]   fact that uh it's embarrassing maybe that windows 8 has not made quite so big a splash but then you
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.480]   look at the history of of o s releases uh windows windows xp was a big hit they replaced it with
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:47.360]   vista vista kind of tank so they kind of secretly rebranded it as window 7 they took the ideas that
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.520]   were working and also the infrastructure improvements that were important for vista and then by calling
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.480]   it window 7 now they have the sort of smash it that they wanted i'm not sure if this is cyclical for
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.560]   microsoft but i have no trouble believing the possibility that windows 8 is sort of like windows vista
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.840]   where it was the unpalatable fusion of desktop and mobile that people didn't want fine that's great
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.080]   we are going to take the ideas that we liked about it the things that you were responding well to
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.160]   it the things that are important for our future and we're going to call the next thing you're uh
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.520]   something else entirely so that when you come back to us you can say uh you know i mean windows 8
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.240]   suck but you but now congratulations you you learned the error of your ways and now you're doing
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.080]   something brand new you're looking at the i've only been be able to look at the coverage of windows 10
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.920]   uh from afar but you see that they're taking things like putting back the start screen but
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.880]   also taking the live tiles concept from uh from their mobile devices and integrating that into the
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.440]   start screen in a very interesting way so it's not necessary for them to have these big flashy
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.920]   rollouts all they have to do is keep the water clean keep it uh keep it furnished and making sure
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.040]   the people that want clean drinking water can get access to that and that's going to be the
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:02.160]   the secret to their success you know we talked about uh the idea of the mac mini finally getting a
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:09.280]   refresh but we didn't talk about this rumor uh coming from uh 9 to 5 mac that might be getting
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:16.480]   retina i-max uh with of course ostanyo somebody uh mark german over at 9 to 5 mac who's i mean he's
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.680]   all about the scoops these days uh says that the company's in late testing and they could launch
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.520]   soon and it's interesting because you know when i first read this article i was like
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:32.240]   is what kind of different retina is it then it already has because i just didn't think of the
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.040]   fact that apple doesn't actually have retina displays for the desktops they're just they just
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.760]   look nice right you know nice 27 inch i-max looks pretty good to me but no that's actually not a you
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:52.000]   know ultra high definition even though i guess uh retina came to the iPhone 4 back in is that right
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.440]   and that was yeah i mean that was that was a pretty big step up so i can imagine for tired eyes it
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:04.240]   would be pretty nice to to gaze upon a retina uh desktop computer as well a lot of pixels yeah
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.520]   so many pixels some that you don't even see not even visible to the naked eye as far as i know
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.400]   they've been working on 4k 5k retina displays they always do many prototypes and they start to figure
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.240]   out what they have audacious prototypes and they have conservative prototypes and try to figure out
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.320]   what they can do that has low enough cost high enough yield and there was a rumor for a while that
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.280]   they would go ahead that the panels would be expensive enough that they'd put them in the
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.440]   cinema display first i think they're called thunderbolt display now because it would be more likely to
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.120]   be bought by mac pro owners and that means they wouldn't have to make as many and they could charge
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.200]   a higher price but if they're going for i-max it means that and we've seen this in other people
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.240]   who make retina or 4k displays the prices are coming down sufficiently that they can get them into
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.480]   the i-mac first which is what they did with the original IPS displays and then when those are
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.200]   in balance sort of push them out into the panels but this makes a ton of sense and it'll it'll happen
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.760]   as soon as apple can make the numbers yeah it's so many pixels um so many pixels the
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.960]   also there was a what jack marichu is a pseudonym i think for somebody who has also some rumor
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.040]   source that said the 27 inch is definitely going to happen whether the question is do they keep the
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:11.440]   old i-max around do they add these at the top of the line they did that with the macbook pro do they
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:18.080]   do they uh just add one or do they add a bunch of them um i i'm really intrigued by this i i was in
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.000]   the camp of never wanting to buy an i-mac again and kind of go with an external monitor of my own and
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.160]   a mac mini or a mac pro and but boy i don't know it'll be an interesting temptation for a lot of us
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:39.200]   to have a nice retina display on a on a big monitor like that if this and it's going to cost a lot
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.800]   i would imagine but it but it could be really it could look really great yeah i'm keen to see what
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.440]   that would look like in the flesh because it's easy to appreciate a retina display on a phone it's
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:55.040]   easy to appreciate it on on even on a notebook that's about 14 inches in front of your face
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.400]   when i have uh when i use my my desktop machine that screen is so far away that even with my reading
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.840]   glasses on i'm not sure how much i'm going to appreciate the retina resolution but that's something i
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.800]   really have to experience to figure out sure yeah i mean the the idea that i movie or final cut pro
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:20.400]   would be able to handle high res you know 4k footage that all makes sense to me but are we all
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.680]   using those programs on a daily basis i almost never do in fact i'm not even really editing that
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:33.760]   many photos on my iMac these days i have to i have to admit that i hear people who are certainly
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.560]   offering sincere and and rational opinions about how gee after i got my retina macbook pro i can't
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:44.480]   even look at a non retina laptop display anymore without wanting to vomit but i on the on a daily
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.320]   basis i'm switching between my retina macbook pro and my old non retina macbook pro and i certainly
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.800]   appreciate the difference but usually when i'm editing a photo an aperture when i'm actually just
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:00.480]   doing a day's work with it i'm aware of the difference but i'm not if you offered me 500
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:06.960]   dollars to uh to if if they non retina version were 500 less based on this experience i wouldn't
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.960]   necessarily be spending the extra 500 for retina it's just not that big of a deal for me
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:18.000]   yeah i mean do we do it what i would love what happens to that desktop computer in the corner
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.120]   of the office i mean it's do how much do we actually need something like the the retina display of
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.480]   course that yeah of course like you like you mentioned andi it's going to look great
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:33.520]   but how much of your uh you know daily process uh depends on that Jason what do you think well
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:40.960]   i don't know it they look great um i appreciate it when i use one i very rarely i mean i've i've
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.520]   used a macbook red namacbook pro but only briefly uh you know for a day or two here and there
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.000]   and i i don't know it looks great it's easier to read the text on the screen i do a lot of reading
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.920]   of text on screens um it's not as huge a deal as it is on a phone or even a tablet andi is
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:03.280]   absolutely right but um it's going to be beautiful and it is where we're going right so the question
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.640]   it's going to be early adopter technology just like everything else you're going to pay through the
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.320]   nose to do it at the beginning and then in the middle somewhere it'll start to make sense and
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.120]   then a few years later everybody will have it and we will have forgotten that we used to be able
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.800]   to see the pixels and we're at the very start of that now where the people are going to buy
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:25.280]   let's say this happens a retina i mac they're going to do it because they really want to be
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.560]   there on the cutting edge and they love it but it's inevitable right three or four years from now
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:35.040]   every display on every apple product will be retina sure patty what are pencils yeah and as well
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.760]   when a when a sub pixel in a mommy pixel well we try to very much they get into a pixel cluster
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:44.400]   but yeah i mean you're you're right and also apple i think more often than not their usual
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.640]   strategy is to keep the price of a product the same but improve it with better components as
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:55.760]   years go by and so if the price of a 27 or even a smaller sized i mac is going to be the same
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.600]   three years from now and it still has a and it has a retina display great well it has a retina
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:05.360]   display i wish that if we had the option of saying well if you value retina we can we can charge you
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.720]   five hundred dollars more for this but if you're perfectly fine with what you have we'll make this
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:15.040]   more affordable more accessible to you but who knows i found six and six plus models will be
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:21.520]   available in china apple has announced starting friday october 17th pre-orders begin friday
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:28.320]   october 10th the week prior interesting a story that i read about yesterday that the gray market
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:34.080]   as they call it for iPhones they say you know buy a bunch of iPhones in hong kong and then get them
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:40.320]   to to third party vendors in Beijing for example what do those what's the premium what what do they
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:46.720]   go for for people who don't want to wait certainly and that the gray market value of the iPhone 6
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:52.080]   and 6 plus has plummeted from what would you know the equivalent would be something like i think that
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:58.320]   you know the the top of the line for the 6 plus was equivalent to about 2,500 that has that has
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.280]   has dropped now to something like the equivalent of two thousand dollars so it's still certainly a
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:11.200]   markup but i wonder how much that really i wonder how much that that that's actually um spells
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:16.960]   what does it mean for the somebody who wants to go through the proper channels of just buy
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.720]   a phone when it's legally available in your country versus the kind of person who will pay
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:29.840]   almost anything no matter what it costs to be first i'm not sure that that that falling prices in a
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:35.600]   gray market is really marrying the actual market but i don't know i mean maybe i'm crazy do we
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.680]   do we think that the six and the six plus are are going to make a killing in China i mean they're
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.040]   on uh you know apples uh has a partnership with China mobile now that was always something that
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:51.760]   it used as an excuse to say well if we if we were on China's um largest carrier then we'd be selling
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:57.440]   more phones i don't know i i i i don't get the impression that somehow it's going to be a flop
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.960]   in China but what does everyone else think the gray market is all about people who want it
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:07.120]   and will pay to get it sure they can otherwise get it right so now it's going to be out in China
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:13.520]   what october 17th mm-hmm yeah um and so the gray market there is going to dry up because people
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.960]   are going to say oh well i can wait that long that's not that long but there will be other parts of
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:24.080]   the gray market too i mean i i went to um bermuda a few years ago on one of these uh mac cruises uh
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.680]   which was pretty cool um but they're in the latin american region um and the people in bermuda are
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.120]   largely british and were really frustrated by the fact that the latin american region was like the
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.360]   last place that got all the new apple gear and so they had an off-brand apple store that was filled
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.920]   with gray market products where people were like literally bringing them back from their trips to
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.720]   london and new york they'd say you know go get a couple more ipads go get a couple more laptops and
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.520]   just bring them back and and those markets will always exist it's a little bit like the the market
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.760]   for upgrades where they take off the back plate of the phone and replace it with a solid gold
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:05.040]   back plate i mean there's a market that will pay and they want it now and you know i i think that
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:10.400]   you know that continues it's just that china will no longer be the uh 800 pound gorilla of gray
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:16.320]   markets now that the the phone got approved yeah and i keep remembering that my time uh in bajing
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.400]   a few years ago and of course from the first tourist spots i wanted to go to was give me show
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.320]   me the the shopping mall that has nothing but counterfeit merchandise because i want to
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:29.040]   buy i want to look i want to look at it maybe buy a counterfeit iphone and the rain and you it's true
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.920]   that you could buy iPhones that this before the iphone was was formally introduced into china and
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:40.080]   they're perfect absolutely pitch perfect and even when you light it up pixel perfect copies of the
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:45.120]   iphones for the most part but you will also see a flip phone like with an illuminated apple logo in
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.480]   the back of it and it's called the ipone ipon e and immediately and immediately you're thinking
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.120]   oh that's stupid doesn't even look like an iphone and then you realize that no the most important
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.760]   thing is that it has a big apple logo that's illuminated so people can see the apple logo so a
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.920]   lot of it is just going it's still going to be that brand uh that even if it even if the
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:09.440]   ill not legitimate market dries up it will still be very very important so well this is a very
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.080]   exclusive very cool like international brand that i have just like people don't even care that you
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:18.720]   don't know that you know that they're your hermies bag or whatever is an octave you like being
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.120]   associated with that cool logo that you've seen uh the the fancy schmancy people in the cover of the
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   national acquirer using that's not new when i was a kid and i went to hong kong you'd go
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.280]   bought your jeans in one store and then go pick the label you wanted before you yeah you finished
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:37.920]   your purchase it's just really yeah wow it's it's it's entirely about brand and perception and image and
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.680]   it's incredibly involved a little bit convoluted from the outside but iphone is just the latest
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:49.360]   sort of cultural icon that's either benefiting or being involved by that anyhow you look at it
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:55.200]   i saw a great image on twitter last week that was a one of those little apple iphone power adapters
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:01.120]   from the u.s um little tiny ones and and uh it was a photo of the labeling on the back of it which said
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.480]   um designed in californib by agal
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:12.880]   seems legit to me yeah agal agal agal agal i think it was agal japan yeah it was very clearly
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:18.880]   somebody who oh and it had a sentel number as the nal number it was very clearly somebody who
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.400]   wasn't really strong with the uh with the uh roman character set and uh yeah it was pretty funny i
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.800]   you know this is a show about agal right right we're talking all about yeah and we're here in
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.040]   californib so seems legit to me agal sure yeah i don't think that means uh should we take one last
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.480]   break before we get to our tips of the week from everybody i think that now is as good as time as any
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.480]   uh this is actually uh this is uh uh uh what's gonna be new uh sponsor at least for me uh this
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:53.440]   episode of mac break quickly is brought to you by castor revolutionizing the mattress industry
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:59.280]   actually got a mattress a couple years ago uh because the one that i had been sleeping on for
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:06.000]   many years physically hurt me and i was hurting myself but it was very expensive the new mattress
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.880]   that i got it was kind of one of these impulse purchases because i wanted to buy it off the
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:17.120]   internet and i felt like oh i'll just pick a brand right that has good brand recognition
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.400]   and hope for the best uh wish i would have known about castor uh when when i did that
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.600]   a castor is slashing the cost of what a typical mattress would go for fifteen hundred dollars
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.360]   and up from there they are not cheap because they cut out resellers they cut out showrooms which
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.880]   i don't know about you but i do not want to go to a mattress showroom that is just not even fun
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.080]   that's like a terrible night out on the town and then they pass the savings directly onto you
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.360]   as an online consumer we love buying things online but it's difficult when you need to
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:54.240]   add mattress is one of the most personal purchases you're ever going to have castor is a comfortable
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.880]   mattress it gives you a great night sleep it's just the right combination of premium latex

[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.520]   and you know if you roll over your partner's not going to wake up in the middle of the night because
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:15.600]   it is designed for comfort for everybody that's involved castor mattress provides long lasting

[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.960]   have a hundred days so that's a lot of sleeping before you say eh i should have maybe gone with
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.520]   something that was a little firmer or something different so you really have a lot of time to try
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:47.360]   it out before you decide okay this is the mattress for me one hundred whole days you don't ever have
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:53.040]   to go to a showroom and lie down on some mattress that who knows who else has been on them
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.280]   sorry i haven't seen this video of leo before writhing around on his mattress i like how he's
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.160]   wearing all white too that's a really nice touch look at him look at him look like he's in like a
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:10.560]   1991 music video really yeah exactly there should be a billy idol needs to walk around the corner
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:17.120]   at some point and yeah this is uh yeah no he's he's he said a lot of really nice things about
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:23.040]   his castor mattress hopefully i can get one as well and statistically lying on a bed in a showroom
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.480]   really doesn't give you uh much of a sense of how it's actually going to be when you sleep in it at
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.160]   night you know you kind of you know the lights are on your rain on your clothes you're not in your
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:40.480]   bedroom it's tough even in person to get the best mattress so castor passes the savings along to

[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:53.840]   did you want to kick off with your pick of the week uh sure uh a couple weeks ago we're
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:59.040]   when i was first talking about the uh uh the coming iphone six plus i was excited about
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   having like a pocketable keyboard and like writing solution because it was such a nice big
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.920]   screen uh and a listener i talked about the stowaway keyboard that the company called
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.400]   Think Outside used to make for the previous generation of pdas and blackberries and trios about 10
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:18.480]   years ago uh looking for something like that uh and actually a listener let me use crayon cam 3000
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:23.600]   the future video podcasting uh this is uh the an actual stowaway keyboard that a listener happened
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.920]   to have rattling around in his office and was nice enough to send me uh and you see this
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.360]   compared to the size of the iphone six and you can understand why this is such a really
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:39.920]   desirable thing i also encountered however a company called lap works that has this keyboard
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.840]   now again here's the original vintage one and here is the lap works version of this folding
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.640]   keyboard they call it the amigo and let me show you why i was so excited about it it's about this
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:57.680]   size but then you do this and then you do this and do this and now you have a full laptop sized
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:04.640]   keyboard it's a transformer exactly it's brilliant it hooks up via bluetooth it comes with a little
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:10.640]   like uh tiny little OEM stand like this and so you put your iphone or ipad or whatever on this of
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.960]   course not just for the iphone but it's for anything else uh and when you're done with it you just
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:23.120]   simply do this do that do this and lift be a little bit careful with it and then you comes back
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:29.360]   into this tiny little easily digestible package and there is your writing kit uh for the entire day
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.840]   uh i have i have i've had this for about a week i've been typing with it you can actually get
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:39.040]   real good touch type on it uh so i'm very very pleased with it and it seems to be absolutely
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:46.560]   identical to this vintage one only you don't have the you know the pocket pc and palmOS keyboard
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:52.080]   shortcuts on it uh and it's really really wonderful stuff the only there are only two drawbacks to it
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:57.600]   number one this is a rechargeable bluetooth keyboard which is good but it uses i don't know if
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:03.600]   you can see it a very very odd ball like old-fashioned style usb connector uh for charging so
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.440]   you're gonna have to make sure you don't lose track of the keep of the cable the charging cable
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.840]   that it comes with because if you lose it you can find another one online but you're not going to
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:18.480]   find it as easily as you're going to be able to find uh a uh a micro usb cable the second thing is that
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:25.760]   uh as you fold it and unfold it uh it's possible and before you get it broken in that this is going
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.160]   to have a little bit of flex left into it and so it might like bend a little bit as you type it
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:34.480]   but it settles down the more you use it you can see me typing on this right now or fake typing
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.000]   upside down on it right now and it's perfectly comfortable to type on even if it does have a
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.520]   little bit of a flex in it when you first use it i i usually have a cleaning a screen cleaning cloth
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.360]   that's in my kit if you put any kind of a cloth underneath it that's just enough to
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.960]   stamp in that and make it perfectly typeable uh there is a third possible drawback to this
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:01.680]   in that this is not cheap it goes for 140 dollars but if there is another keyboard that does what this
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:07.760]   does and makes as beautiful a typing experience in such a small package i haven't found it yet
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.120]   there's a company called uh called they're making a keyboard called journo that was funded on kickstarter
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:19.280]   about a year and a half ago as many kickstarter hardware projects go they have blown through
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.520]   shipping deadlines as they you know take this idea that they had for a keyboard and try to make
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.400]   intershipping product uh and so now they're promising delivery in october who knows if they do ship
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.320]   it'll be 79 bucks it might be interesting to check out but for now if you really want that kind of
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.640]   portability whether you've got you know an iphone 5s or if you're just using a mac an ipad mini
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:43.840]   boy there is nothing like this and this is exactly what i was sort of looking for so
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.360]   i love it i'm three thousand three thousand two which is yeah if you look at lap works uh
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.880]   website that's apparently the sale price that price is normally 150 dollars that's pretty steep but
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.640]   again if it's uh if it's a better experience on something that you're going to be typing with
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.440]   and you like being mobile and like uh connecting it to various devices it certainly does seem nice
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.560]   and it pulls up i mean i i'm folding it and folding back up as part of the fun this is this is it's
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.640]   it's almost it's almost magical the way it works and like it's like i'm saying i mean that it's this
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.720]   may may not be for everybody but a lot of people really do like to travel with minimal uh load out
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:21.760]   and stuff and if you think about going on vacation or you don't want to take a laptop well how about
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.360]   just take your mac your ipad mini and take this and now you're good and you can put this in just
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:32.640]   the little day bag that you use to walk around the round town and for me i've always had this dream of
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.320]   either being so incredibly wealthy that i can simply board an airplane carrying nothing but the
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.760]   clothes on my back and just buy what i need when i get there then throw it all away when i board
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:47.120]   the plane home or having equipment that's small enough that i can actually board with just a tiny
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.040]   tiny little bags and this is this is a good step towards that again not cheap but if that's what
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:56.160]   your goal is and you travel enough like that then it might be worth it or you're in a situation
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.880]   where it's just it doesn't make sense to have a whole laptop i mean i i'm probably the only person
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.600]   who spends four hours at a time at the hair salon but that actually happened last friday and i had
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.800]   work to do and so what ends up happening is there's a lot of cutting and pasting on my ipad because
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.240]   that's really the only thing that's comfortable enough to have kind of it in my lap but but it
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.800]   sucks say that's not ideal at all the laptop was just a little bit too much the hairdresser would
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.560]   have been annoyed so if i had something like this it would have been the perfect situation
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.800]   one one last note though not that you bring it up of course it has a folding hinge in the middle of
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.640]   it so you have to have it on a flat stable surface in order to use it if you try to just
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.840]   bridge it across your lap it will just simply collapse like a poorly constructed bridge
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:42.000]   so do you need a hard surface in order for it to work that's the only problem about it all right
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.600]   lap works amigo folding keyboard one hundred forty dollars that might be the perfect accessory for
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:53.760]   you uh rene ritchie what is your pick of the week uh one of the things like andy that i've
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.960]   been most excited about with ios 8 is the manual camera controls and when you combine those with
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.680]   the iphone six or the iphone six plus it is a magical magical new world and there are a lot of
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   interesting ones for example there's manual which is a very simple camera app but there's also
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.040]   camera plus which is the app uh spear headed by lisa betany that has integrated all of these
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.040]   controls into their already jam packed app and you have to go and enable them by default they're
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.920]   not enabled but if you go into the settings and you turn on advanced and you can turn on exposure
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.640]   priority or you can go full on manual and then you get these controls and you can leave it on manual
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.880]   if that's what you're used to but you can also press the focus button and manually shift focus if
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.520]   you want to put something ios has got these really good algorithms for determining optimal focus
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:40.160]   optimal exposure optimal white balance but you can override them so you can have an object that's
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.040]   close and would would be the logical choice to focus on and just say no i want that blurry i want
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.600]   to focus on the small dude in the background or the color tint for example if you're in mixed
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:55.040]   lighting you can you can change the uh the temperature or the tint controls you can bias exposure so you
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.960]   you can go between minus eight and plus eight so you can just uh and andy mentioned this last
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.880]   week really well if you if you the camera is telling you it wants to do a certain ISO but you're like
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.960]   no no it's too grainy i know it's gonna be dark you can push it you can force it to go a little bit
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.920]   up or you can go complete exposure control with ISO and the shutter speed and just you you can set
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.600]   it up exactly the way you want it you can take long exposures you can it makes the iPhone really a
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.720]   first-class like mobile photography citizen and all the stuff that i was jealous that i could do on
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.120]   windows phone that i couldn't do on ios you still can't do that in the ios camera app you can you
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.600]   can bias exposure now in the ios camera app but if you get one of these great third-party apps like
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:40.400]   camera plus it's wow it's just a playground camera plus has been it camera plus has a lot of competition
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:46.880]   now obviously but when when tap tap tap first uh released camera plus and and yeah lisa uh betony
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:52.400]   has has done lots of really great demonstrations here on twit on variety of different shows but it
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:58.720]   was like oh i mean it was it was the best thing since sliced bread now i have like 14 other apps
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.920]   that are kind of like camera plus or try to be anyway but it really was the first app that that
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:11.200]   helped you create photos that you just you had the you you have the power to do that but the the
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:17.200]   native camera app in ios has always been a little feature um not feature rich enough well it's
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:21.920]   designed so that most people most of the time can just tap and get a good enough photo but and
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.960]   you know camera plus might be too much for you because like i said it's jam-packed and there's
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.120]   apps like manual which is really simple all it does is expose those manual camera controls
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:32.480]   and let you play around with them and you can actually teach yourself how all this stuff works
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.640]   if you're not already familiar with it but you combine things like there's photo pixels in in
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.960]   the i-phone six and seven so it's lightning it's so fast to focus that you don't even see the little
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.760]   square of focus magic anymore but turning all that off and letting you play around with what if I
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.240]   move this here or move this here it just lets you start to understand the process really nicely
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.320]   yeah absolutely the one thing that i love the cameras on the i-phone six and six plus
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.120]   but the only things i don't like it like about it is that i think the interface is way way too
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:08.560]   cluttered it is so hard to i hate the fact that the the button for for filter effects is has the
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:14.400]   exact same prominence as the uh as the actual shutter button i think that's kind of nuts i was
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.280]   accidentally activating this mode like time and time again because of the size of this phone i
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.400]   hate the fact that it actually i don't i want to compare my experience to other people's
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.520]   it took me until two days ago to find out that to switch between modes you can actually swipe
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.640]   between any any place on the viewer screen to do it you don't have to just do it here oh yeah oh
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.840]   how annoying that's new with iOS 8 you had the iOS 7 because i would have been very embarrassed
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.960]   with myself if that were true and even so i've been using this for a week and a half and i didn't
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.840]   discover that possibly because i've been using the iOS 7 version of it i mean this is uh there's a
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.360]   lot of stuff that's really really annoying about this this app and that's why i think this is such a
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:57.120]   huge opportunity for apps like camera plus i did have that i saw that you'd already picked it uh
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.640]   because if not i would have definitely have chosen it myself uh and i mean just the ability to do
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.440]   something as simple as i've got an Emmanuel mode right now you tap the settings and you simply
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.200]   scroll to get the setting that you actually want because if you're chasing if you're chasing your
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.120]   kid around the living room uh you don't care if it's grainy you just want please select i'm going to
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.120]   select one 750th of a second because i want frozen motion i don't want this
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:24.960]   blond three-foot blur in this picture uh and you know the the ability to override all this stuff is
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.520]   such a big deal and i it's just made this app so much more valuable i've downloaded three or four
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.480]   different manual exposure apps and the clarity of this interface and the simplicity of this big
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.160]   honking button for the shutter uh is what's it made me a really big fan of it
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:46.000]   Jason Snell what is your pick of the week uh it's a it's gonna sound really boring because it's
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.320]   p-calc which is a calculator app and you're saying to yourself wait there's a calculator app in ios
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.400]   why should i even bother buying a ten dollar calculator app so the guy who does p-calc James
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.040]   Thompson has been working on it uh for i think almost 20 years now he's been doing this it was a
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:08.640]   mac app and now it's an ios app and it's got some great ios 8 features um it it will put a calculator
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.520]   in your notification screen so you can just flip down and calculate something and flip it back up
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.080]   oh nice calculator won't do that and the big new feature i mean it's got every nerdy calculator
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.520]   feature you would want but the new feature in the latest version is you can have customizable
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.520]   layouts so i've seen a lot of people creating like tip calculators and creating currency converters
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:35.040]   and creating unit converters where you know the buttons can on the on the layouts can be anything
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:39.920]   you want them to be um you can set up macros if they're particular calculations you do on a regular
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.480]   basis and assign it to a button and uh name the button and do all of that so if you're somebody
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.440]   who finds yourself doing calculations a lot you can do a whole lot better than the stock apple
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:55.600]   calculator and you should check out p-calc p-calc uh ten bucks on the app store i believe ten bucks
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.360]   on the app store yep yep you know it's it's kind of what you mentioned well why would you want to
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.400]   calculate you've already got a stock calculator i mean you could say the same thing for weather
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.200]   apps i mean i happen to like a app called dark sky i'm sure you've talked about it here on mac
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:13.200]   break weekly uh and so you know it just gives you more options number crunching is uh exactly and
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.280]   if you just go ahead and run a i was gonna say like i love this app too to jason's why i can just
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.200]   pick up my phone now on the lock screen pull down notification center tap in a few things get a
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:25.920]   quick calculation throw it back up and be on my way it's it's so nice to have it there yeah
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:34.320]   p-calc for ipad iphone and ipod touch again ten dollars in the u_s_ store uh apparently does very
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:37.360]   slightly uh where it's available in other countries all of those yeah all those
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.600]   extra prices very randomly based on you can use p-calc to normalize them you can
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:48.960]   universal app though uh one one app for for all your i devices well ipad it's a full-size calculator
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:55.040]   in notification center it's amazing that's so cool that is so cool why why why apple wouldn't offer
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:02.160]   that is they do want Yosemite but not on ios yet and the notification center could be so much
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:07.520]   better if we just had more of that in-line information um but again it's that's probably
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.960]   so someone at apple is probably like oh yeah should have done that we should do that in the next
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:16.000]   version of ios 8 that we're really out next april or whatever i'm looking forward to more apps
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.440]   that they're doing more stuff with the notification center because that that's the stuff that when i
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.240]   switch between ios and android on a daily basis that's one thing i miss is the ability to pull down
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.000]   from the top of the screen just i want to start playback or stop playback where i want to get
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.560]   one thing a little done that's projected into that that notification center from the app and then
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.160]   flick it back up again and that's such a handy thing i'm so glad it's coming to ios 8
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:43.200]   well i believe we've come to the end of a wonderful episode of mac break weekly if you joined us
