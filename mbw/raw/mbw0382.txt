[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800]   Hey, everybody, Leo Leport here.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.880]   Yes, indeed, it is that special time of the year
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.440]   when everybody's gone home for the holidays.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.520]   It's Christmas Eve, after all.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.720]   So we're not going to do a regular Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.400]   We decided to give Andy, Renee, and all our regulars,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.560]   including this bird, some time off.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.000]   And we're going to do a best of.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.440]   You like?
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.320]   We've really made it festive, have we?
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.160]   Yes, we have.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.720]   Some of the best moments from 2013 of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.320]   And if you stay tuned, you're going to see him all.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.760]   So stay right here.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   There.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.480]   He's going to stay there.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.520]   And you too.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.640]   We don't know what the first one is though, do we?
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.960]   We have no idea.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   Well, watch as this funny thing happened.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers all
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.400]   your hat and Mac needs.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.480]   We're all wearing hats today.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.600]   No one knows why, starting with Andy and Aco
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440]   from the Chicago Sun Times, who always wears a hat.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.320]   I think it's in honor of you and your oats.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.360]   No, it's-- first, I guess we shouldn't be
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.240]   ungrateful to the Wall Corporation.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.000]   I mean, it's nice that you sent us all those home hair
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600]   clipping kits for consideration for the show.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.400]   But I mean, they're hard to use.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.000]   Let's list this.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.880]   What kind of a problem.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   So thank you for sending them, but we might not
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.760]   have to be able to write about them.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.200]   By the way, I'm glad to see that you're
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   honoring Dennis the Minnes by wearing a J Ward hat today.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.720]   J Ward hat?
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.440]   Oh, no, it's a J Ward hat.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.880]   Here you go.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   OK, I'm sorry.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   I looked at H--
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.360]   J Ward fire.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.840]   Yeah, J Ward fire department.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   All right, there you go.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.320]   I guess since we have some pros here, we should really--
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.480]   I think you probably-- at least some of you
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.080]   are the market for a Mac Pro.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.160]   Maybe not me and Andy.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.240]   Maybe not you, Renee, but certainly Scott and Aaron.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.360]   And with the understanding that this was a sneak peek.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.400]   What the hell?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   So every developer has a fantasy of themselves
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.480]   as sort of an evil genius.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.320]   And this is an evil genius computer, right?
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.240]   It's a Mac Pro.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.120]   It's a black.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.360]   It's a cylinder.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   And you can imagine yourself.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.240]   You can plug three 4K monitors into it.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.120]   You could just imagine yourself in front of the bank
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800]   of the enormous monitors.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.960]   I think it's really going to make
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.040]   me feel like an evil genius.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   It's interesting looking.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.280]   One fan, one big fan at the top,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.480]   and then what they call-- what do they call the?
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.720]   Unified thermal core?
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.640]   Yeah, you mean the T-Sync on right through the middle?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   That's the G4 cube.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.320]   Well, this is what I have to say.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.200]   The real question is, is this a great innovative machine?
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.440]   Innovate my ass, as Phil Schiller said.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.560]   Or is it another cube?
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.680]   And it reminds me a little bit of the cube.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.400]   What do you think, Scott?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.280]   Are you excited?
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.960]   The cube was supposed to be mainstream, right?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   So I think that--
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   I bought one the last day of its availability.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.280]   I'm proud to say.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.960]   It's a crack.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.480]   Yep.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.520]   I think the thing with the new Mac Pro
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.280]   is people are going to buy it no matter what it looks like.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   The people who are the market for it want it.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.840]   They don't care what it looks like.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   I wonder if this is not going to stimulate
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.840]   a giant market for hackintosh, is to be honest with you.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.280]   Really, you think?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   Well, I'll tell you one thing that is a concern for me,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.400]   and ours Technica had a good analysis of this.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.760]   The dual GPUs, as great as they are, are soldered on.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.240]   Yep.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.200]   There is no upgrade.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.400]   It is packaged like a MacBook Air or a UI Mac.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   It is not a Mac Pro of old.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.280]   Easy to upgrade, I guess, the RAM,
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.880]   because there's-- but there's only four sockets.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   So if you really want to go big--
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.800]   Gonna go hide density.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.240]   You're going to be paying a lot of money.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.800]   There's eight giga-hire RAMs.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.600]   As for the design, I love that they tried something insane.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.560]   They picked the perfect machine to try it with,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.000]   because it's not a mainstream model.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.400]   It's for the high end.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.880]   And I love that they decided to take a flyer on making it
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.320]   in the US, because it's the right model to it.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.040]   I do like that.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.760]   Isn't it awesome?
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.520]   I think the old Mac Pro was like the Escalade.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   It was the high end, but it had lots of room for kids and cars
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.440]   and everything you want in the back.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.520]   And then you want the Lamborghini.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.160]   It's not a truck.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.760]   I mean, there's no room in the back for anything.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.240]   This country's squire.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.640]   That thing.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.560]   It was a boat.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.440]   It was an expensive boat.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.040]   But I loved it.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.520]   I mean, I have four drives in mine.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.080]   And I think there are a lot of people who love the idea.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.400]   You've got all those drive bays.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.200]   It's easy to get into.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.040]   But Thunderbolt 2.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.840]   So you can go out to drive bays, and you can go out to
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.720]   potentially to retinethunderbolt displays when they ship.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   Right.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.280]   I think the point is that Apple didn't decide to abandon
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.440]   pro users, but they decided to let go of a certain kind of
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.440]   pro user.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.920]   So they want the kind that really needs super high
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.360]   performance, the kind that would, for God's sakes, need
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.840]   three 4K screens on their desktop at the same time.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.920]   But not the sort of person who's like, I'm sorry, but it's
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.840]   taking entirely too long to crack these 15,000
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.040]   pathways that install eight radion cards.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.520]   It is a--
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.160]   It's actually a Bitcoin mining machine.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.120]   Let's say, if I plug in three 4K screens, what am I going to
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.520]   do with the rest of my 4K screens?
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.960]   Well, what are you going to do with the rest of your millions
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.480]   of dollars?
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.640]   Because let's think, how much the pro is going to cost by
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.000]   itself?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.320]   And then how many 4K screens can you afford?
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.600]   I saw John's here at Cusa last night doing a mental
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.400]   breakdown of how much the components we're going to
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   cost, like how much those CPUs would cost, how much those
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.200]   GPUs would cost.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.560]   And it's not going to be cheap.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.240]   The MacBook Air was fairly cheap.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.080]   The iMac was fairly cheap.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.880]   Are you looking at a $10,000 machine here?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.040]   I don't think $10,000, maybe $4,000 to $5,000.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.640]   Unless they get a really good deal on parts.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.360]   I was checking with some builders myself yesterday
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.240]   afternoon, and that was their back of the envelope, guess
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.080]   too, that they don't think it could be sold for less than
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.440]   4,000.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   They'd be surprised if they didn't hit a $5,000 to $6,000
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.080]   target, though.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   And then Adam Hunter.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.680]   That's without monitor.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.120]   And Pro-level margins are pretty good for Apple.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.640]   Right.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.400]   I'm thinking 6 grand out the gate.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.640]   But I paid 6 grand for my last Mac Pro once I
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.280]   stocked it appropriately.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.320]   But you could change the drives.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.680]   You could change the graphics cards.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.400]   That's when you can't.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.760]   And I have changed the graphics card.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.840]   You know, I've created the graphics.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.160]   I heard a month or two ago with a 2950.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.480]   And this was another point ours technica made.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.320]   The Mac OpenGL drivers are so god awful that I saw no
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.120]   speed improvement.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.880]   None on a much faster card and on Windows.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.640]   A ton of improvement.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.520]   And I think even Apple even said this.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.920]   And this is going to get a little geeky.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.400]   But they said OpenCL.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.560]   They want you instead of CUDA.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.480]   They want you to go with OpenCL.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.120]   OpenCL 4.something in OpenCL.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.760]   What is the pro--
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.840]   you're a programmer, so I don't think it's as quite as an
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.400]   issue for you.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.920]   It's more for a graphics or a video guy.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.440]   Right.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   You know why they want to do it is they want to be able to
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.200]   move between different graphics card providers.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.360]   They don't want you to go in CUDA.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.400]   They want you to use OpenCL.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.600]   Because CUDA is Nvidia only.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   That's right.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.680]   OpenCL 4.something.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.200]   They want you to stand.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.320]   They want to be able to put ATI or whatever cards inside it.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.680]   Right, mostly ATI.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.320]   I don't know where the whatever might be.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.520]   And also, Joe's GPU, I don't know.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.360]   It's a strange thing.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.760]   There was a lot of strange things this event.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.680]   But one of them is that Apple did a sneak preview.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.560]   I mean, it was a perfect event for a pro machine.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.880]   We discussed that last week.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.840]   But it's not shipping until later in the year.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.800]   So it was way ahead.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.240]   Usually, Apple comes out and says, available today, available
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.280]   in two weeks.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.400]   And some of that might be still chipset related.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.080]   Some of that might just be them not finishing it.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.760]   Well, it's not a Haswell, is it?
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.880]   It's an Ivy Bridge, I think.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.920]   That's what Anon said.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.680]   You actually jumped in and said--
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.840]   There was some debate yesterday about--
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.920]   There is a Haswell search Xeon.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.120]   But it wasn't the one that Apple would probably use.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.680]   It's still coming.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.760]   It's not available yet.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.000]   And if they use the last ones, then people
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.880]   will be upset because it'll mean there will be a spec update
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.720]   to the next ones.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   Right.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.680]   But the point is usually that Apple won't
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.320]   announce a product they can't sell immediately.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.040]   Because they don't want to cannibalize something else.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.560]   But no one's buying Mac Pros right now.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.120]   So they're like, yeah, what the heck, let's show them.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.240]   Yeah, nothing to cannibalize it.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.760]   Exactly right.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.520]   In fact, there's a lot of reason to do it now,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.600]   just to stem whatever flow there
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.920]   might be of pros away from Macintosh.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.040]   Exactly.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.720]   Say, hey, we are going to do something for you.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.960]   The opposite situation from what they're usually in,
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   where they don't want to cannibalize the product that they
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.040]   have this time they want to stop it.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.800]   It's museum of modern art beautiful.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.960]   I mean, I'm not denying that.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.440]   And it's shiny.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.760]   It's not beat beaten at all.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.840]   It is aluminum.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.640]   I thought it might be polycarbonate, because it looks like--
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.200]   It looks like a psilon.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.520]   You know, if it has a little red light,
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.720]   it looks like something down.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.360]   I'm buying it.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.040]   That sounds like a great mod, actually.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.080]   And when you take the housing off,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.400]   it looks like Darth Vader in his meditative chamber
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.560]   before they put the helmet back on.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   I can't believe that that was an accident.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.560]   No, by the way, it is about the size of the atomic.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.000]   It's only about eight.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.680]   And it's one eighth, the volume of the previous Mac.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.120]   It's tiny.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.280]   Yeah, it's tiny.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.480]   But because it doesn't have any spinning drives in it,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.000]   it only has SSD.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.240]   And they had several of them on display
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.520]   on the third floor of my story.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.480]   Yeah, so they had two that were closed and two that were open.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.680]   And it looks exactly like Andy said.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.880]   Like someone came in, the clamps took the helmet,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.640]   folded straight up.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.800]   And you see the back of the skull all on the side.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.360]   It's beautiful looking inside and out, though.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.040]   I mean, they do the aesthetics.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.320]   I'm not denying it, gorgeous.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.200]   I think what it would be, though, is overpriced
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.160]   and not very upgradable.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.920]   And with--
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.840]   How many USB-- just four or three or four USB ports?
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.240]   Strangely, a lot of fire wire.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.040]   And there's fire wire on it.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   But here's the heartbreaking thing.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   It is a beautiful object.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.040]   And it will be beautiful for about 10 minutes
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.600]   until the user is done admiring it.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.160]   And they put it on the desk and start
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.120]   plugging all these crappy cables into it.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.800]   And then three weeks later, when it's
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   been recycling all the dust in the office
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.480]   throughout through the system for three or four weeks,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.200]   it's going to--
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.760]   I mean, I don't know a lot of high end computer users.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.560]   I don't know a lot of high end computer users that
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.400]   are fastidious about dusting.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.680]   But when you turn it at lights up, Andy, when you turn it,
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.280]   it lights up.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.120]   Oh, my god.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.120]   I've got to have it now.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.640]   I'm thinking it's really a very rich person's home theater
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.920]   PC is what it really is.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.680]   It should be quiet with that big fan.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.240]   I officially give myself permission
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.520]   to hate anybody who buys this machine as a home theater PC.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.360]   Andy--
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.680]   I officially am OK.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.400]   And especially if you have to buy it
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.920]   because you have three 4K projection screens.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.120]   That's why I'm saying.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.200]   And you can airplay to the screens, too, now.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.720]   It's spite, but still I'm going to own that.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.440]   I'm going to hate you for that.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.640]   I apologize in advance, Andy.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.360]   How many people are that big a fan of the Spice Girls movie
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.840]   Renee?
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.440]   I mean, right here, sir.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.360]   And 3D, baby.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.840]   And four 4K screens.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.000]   By the way, if you go to apple.com/macpro,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.240]   you get--
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.040]   I should do that again, a little--
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.600]   can you see my computer?
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.520]   Little space animation.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.480]   [SINGING]
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.840]   I want to throw-- yeah, bring me over the 25th anniversary, Matt,
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.320]   because I want to kind of compare the two.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.240]   This is Apple's 25th anniversary, Matt.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   Wow, if you paint this black.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.840]   That's where all the--
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.960]   It's gotten taller and thinner.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.240]   No innovation, my ass.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.680]   That was a lot.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.320]   This has a lovely, a din plug for the speaker.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.960]   Look at that.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.120]   That's like 50,000 pin.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.720]   I've seen it in the Apollo program.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.680]   Well, you don't have to bring the whole thing over.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.400]   It's OK.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.840]   We just wanted to show the CPU.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.240]   But I--
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.360]   Is that 4K?
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.000]   The rest of it.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.160]   That's not quite 4K.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.520]   That might be a half K display.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.840]   If I put all my iPads together, it would add up to 4K.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.120]   Anyway, it must have come for something.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.800]   I'm sorry to be so negative.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.920]   I shouldn't be so negative.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.040]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   But I do-- I think what I'm wondering
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.840]   is our pro is going to flock to this.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.360]   We don't know.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.080]   I mean, can they rack on it?
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.520]   No.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.440]   Well, that's-- you know, cylinders are not the most efficient.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.680]   Well, actually, they are the most efficient way
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.920]   for that volume, aren't they?
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.760]   They're just hard to pack.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.200]   But they're not most efficient when it comes
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.280]   to putting other things around them.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.800]   Right.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.280]   The most efficient in units of one.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.200]   And, you know, for cooling, they're probably
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.400]   a very efficient-- I don't know.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.280]   But I would guess that's a very efficient setup.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.120]   And, you know, it's a beautiful page at apple.com/mac/pro.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.280]   So you watch, you click it, and nothing--
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.880]   something will happen.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.160]   Scroll?
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.840]   I'm on Linux.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.640]   I can't scroll.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   Show title.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.120]   Well, while we were watching this video during the keynote,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.880]   I was thinking to myself, this is either a promo video
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   for a really awesome desktop PC or really bad Will Smith
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.360]   movie.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.560]   Up to two times faster, considering the last one
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.120]   was two and a half years ago, two times this kind of--
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.160]   actually, that's compared to the current Mac
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.040]   pro two and a half years ago.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.160]   There is a theory that apple needs a hypercar.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.000]   They have to have something at the top that's sort of their
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.280]   inspirational breakdown.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.040]   I don't know.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.960]   I have to give apple a lot of credit in that.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.760]   The people who are buying this, they don't really care about
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.000]   cool desktop design.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.600]   They just want the amps.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.840]   They just want the power.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.440]   So the fact that they really went to town on this,
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.920]   probably knowing that--
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.000]   given that it's going to be one of a kind machine that they
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.480]   can charge thousands of dollars for,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.600]   that gave them a certain amount of liberty.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.280]   But when I wrote about it this morning, it's on the
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.160]   Sun Times side and the Gridge Cargo side.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.480]   I did say that what I like the most about this is that this
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.120]   is not an aspirational device.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.240]   This is designed to actually be put to work and not simply
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.920]   admired.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.800]   I mean, you could put your cardboard Quaker
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.520]   Road box on the top of it and just not even admire it at all.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.680]   And you'd still be getting every single ounce of--
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.640]   every single dollar of value you'd be getting out of it.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.120]   Do you find it odd they put AC and 802.11 AC in there when
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.880]   they offer it?
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.760]   Well, actually, they have an AC airport.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.040]   Yeah, they announced the extreme too.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.560]   The airport extreme.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.640]   AD is literally just around the corner and has some
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.520]   significant benefits over AC.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.000]   This is not an upgradable machine, folks.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.920]   In my opinion, you're going to be buying--
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.560]   It's the first one.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   --2013 technology.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.160]   I have a history of first ones, like the first MacBook Air,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.640]   the first Retina MacBook Pro, the first Unibody MacBook.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.960]   I think this is going to sell kind of like the cube in the
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.240]   25th anniversary Mac.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.240]   It's a specialty product.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.480]   How about-- let me ask you the audience, because there's
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.120]   probably a lot of pros in the audience.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.040]   There's a huge audience here.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   By the way, thank you all for being here.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.360]   This is an unusual number of people for Mac break weekly.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.440]   Dan Benjamin in the back.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.720]   It's great to see you.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.160]   No, no.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.040]   He's just wearing a 5x5 shirt.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.120]   So how many of you will buy this?
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.640]   One guy.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   Anybody else?
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.840]   Why would you buy this?
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.480]   Or just shout it out.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.000]   You do video production.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.960]   You do video production.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   I would wonder if some people might say, gosh, I could get a
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.120]   PC that is going to be upgradable, maybe a little bit
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:04.480]   more effective and certainly more affordable.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   Do you think they're going to consider it?
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.360]   Would they consider that?
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.680]   I don't know.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.960]   You have to hack and touch it if you want to run Final Cut.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.040]   They did say, by the way, Final Cut will be updated for
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   this issue.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.480]   Absolutely.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.040]   So one of my concerns is it vents out the top.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.320]   And I know my wife is going to lay a binder or something
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.960]   right on top of it.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   And the whole thing is going to melt down.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.840]   Maybe it'll float.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.640]   It'll be a puddle of Mac Pro there on my desk.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   Good news is the video, though.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.840]   Exactly.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.200]   The binder will slowly rise.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.240]   Not in the air.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.720]   I was going to say, that's actually the advanced version
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.680]   of the CPU monitor.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.280]   You just put a hollow plastic ball on top of it.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.160]   You can tell by how much it's hovering over that vent, how
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.040]   much the CPU is over stressed.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.480]   So try to power down before it gets halfway towards the ceiling.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.800]   Because we're here today to discuss what is over Renee
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.600]   Richie's right shoulder.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.280]   A gold iPhone.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.400]   It's not gold.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.480]   It's champagne.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.360]   Yes.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.920]   So OK, I've got to put you and Andy on the spot because you
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   told me there'd be no fingerprint reader.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.800]   You were pretty sure--
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.680]   I'm purely adamant about that.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.200]   You told--
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.320]   I don't know if we even talked--
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   I told you a gold iPhone.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.360]   I think I poo-pooed that.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.400]   I'm still poo-pooing.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.560]   And it seems bizarre.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.480]   So what's the story?
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.440]   You have the scoop.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.840]   I started asking because the analyst who was talking about it
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.280]   is one of the only--
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.400]   there's different kinds of analysts.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.200]   There's financial analysts and industry analysts.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.800]   And financial analysts are chronically unreliable.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.000]   But among financial analysts--
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.600]   and I don't remember how to pronounce his name.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.640]   Minkchi Kuo.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.800]   Minkchi Kuo, that's correct.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.240]   He said it two or three times, and he's
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   one of the more reliable ones.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.640]   So I started asking around.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   And on Friday, I managed to get at least two people to confirm--
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.760]   I don't want to use the word confirm.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.520]   But to tell me that, yes, indeed, there is a gold iPhone 5S,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.480]   and it will be available along with the other models.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.160]   So no sapphire outy belly button on it, but a gold iPhone.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.400]   So this is not the color iPhone, the 5C, the less expensive iPhone.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.560]   This is the main line.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.880]   There'll be black, white, and champagne.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.200]   For people, some people think it's going to be like,
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.160]   C3PO gold, but it's really going to be--
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.760]   this silver and white model now.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.440]   It's a totally--
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.160]   Is that the Pantone color?
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.920]   C3PO?
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.880]   I'm kind of like a car.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.200]   I would like it to be C3PO gold.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.840]   I'm hoping for a crow.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.320]   So somebody in the chat room said,
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.120]   this is the Paris Hilton edition, Boffin says.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.880]   It's just light.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.400]   If you imagine the current white and silver iPhone,
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.600]   and you just bring it a little bit towards gold.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.520]   And I started trying to think why Apple would do this.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.160]   And it's six years into their product cycle.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.720]   Now it's a mature product.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.000]   There's not going to be any big outward differentiator
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.240]   between the 5 and the 5S the way there are when they actually
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.480]   change the physical design on those years.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.000]   It's more competitive than ever.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.440]   And doing something as simple as using gold
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.320]   anodization, which is also the easiest color to anodize--
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   And I like--
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.720]   Much easier than black.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.160]   Real black is really hard, but gold is easy.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.320]   You just add a little bit of iron oxide and voila.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.640]   The chemical reaction takes over for you.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.880]   It makes-- it's easy to do.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.480]   It adds a little bit of variety to the lineup.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.000]   Gold is not a low end sort of a color.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   So it kind of preserves the iPhone as a premium product.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.520]   Kind of a tacky color, some say, though.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.080]   Well, a little Kim Kardashian.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.960]   But it turns out that the vast majority of aftermarket iPhone
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.040]   colorings are gold.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.200]   People more than half the people who
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.360]   want to get their iPhone colored after they buy it from Apple
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.320]   go for the gold option.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.520]   I also see a lot of bejeweled cases out there.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.440]   But I don't think people are going to do the Apple whatever
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.000]   to do that.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You know, I have--
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.520]   OK, I'm going to--
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.400]   I'm going to add the new Apple ad for it in the notes.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:43.880]   Oh, good.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.720]   Let's play that ad chat.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.160]   You know what?
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.680]   I looked at it.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.080]   I've been completely dismissive.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.240]   I'm such a sheep.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:54.720]   I want it.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.360]   You're going to get it.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.440]   I want it.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.280]   That's the one I'm going to get.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:57.840]   Here's the ad.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   You're going to get it.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.480]   I have it.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.080]   I like the best.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.520]   See, this is the nearest one.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.560]   But I also like savings the money.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.520]   So when direct TV tell me five months free for most premium
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.000]   televisions package--
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Not quite Vladimir Putin, but very close young.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.440]   I'm paying it.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.080]   So is this for the Russian market?
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.640]   Is that what we're making a gold iPhone?
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.080]   I love it.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.720]   I think we do that.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.320]   First of all, gold giraffe.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.000]   I would do that.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.280]   Don't tell me that a teacup giraffe would not sell.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.920]   It would sell.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.680]   I think it would just be a big space.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.160]   I think it should be iPhone gold.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.080]   Opulence.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.720]   I has it.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   I have it.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.240]   So what do you guys think?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.840]   I think it's very likely.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.560]   I think in some of the other cultures,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.680]   I think that they are-- it's very popular.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.600]   And I think that there's quite a few people in the United
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.200]   States that will buy a gold one.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.160]   It's fine.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.000]   I'm not going to buy it.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.400]   Yeah, I mean, it'd be cool if they go--
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.240]   I think that this is the--
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.400]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.240]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.560]   I was going to say that this is the phone
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.360]   that you don't want to use after Labor Day.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.320]   The white shoe phone.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.800]   The white shoes and the white slacks,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.640]   you're done until next season.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.160]   So it becomes your seasonal iPhone
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.560]   that as you're in the Hamptons, you bring out
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.880]   your gold iPhone and then you use it.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.960]   But otherwise, I think mid-winter,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.840]   except around the holiday season, it's a little tacky.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.520]   It's a little much.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.400]   So I think it will do very well in Palm Desert.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.480]   It will do very well in Florida.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.040]   Hollywood will be fine.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.760]   Those kind of kitchy countries will do OK with it as well.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.120]   But I don't see your normal geek carrying this thing around.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.280]   But I couldn't help but think of that episode of The Simpsons
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.920]   where Lisa decides she wants to revolutionize the child's
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.680]   doll industry and spends the entire episode
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.320]   and gets all kinds of celebrity feminist experts in
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.840]   to develop this brand new wonderful role model positive
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.120]   doll that turns out that all the girls want.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.000]   And then the Malibu Stacy, the Barbie people, decide,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.160]   we have to head this off.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.480]   Why don't we just bring out the same old Malibu Stacy
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.880]   only now with the new hat?
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.360]   And then all the girls want the Malibu Stacy with the new hat.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.760]   I think the gold tone might be Malibu iPhone with the new hat.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   That's all.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.520]   Especially this year we've seen like some of the other cool
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.040]   smones.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.280]   No, nothing wrong with that.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.680]   I think that Apple is missing a trick by only having black
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.120]   and white because people do like to do like to personalize
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.640]   a phone.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.320]   They do like to have something that really is
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.880]   identifiably theirs.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.400]   And although I don't think they can--
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.920]   on the iPhone 5, they can make like nine different colors
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.560]   and keep that kind of supply chain going.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.520]   But if they are-- if one way to remind people
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.920]   that this is still a cool modern phone
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.360]   is to introduce a new metallic color, that's good.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.400]   I think that the iPhone 5 got sort of slammed a little bit
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.960]   because it didn't look all that different.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.600]   And it sort of swept aside the idea
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.120]   that while the camera is very much improved,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.720]   the CPU is much improved.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.080]   They changed so much about it.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.800]   The fact that it doesn't have like a transformer
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.560]   set of hover wheels on it doesn't mean
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.040]   that it's not a new great phone.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.360]   Sometimes if you want to give the people what they want
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.360]   to convince them that there is something new going on,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.840]   psychology cells, solid.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.160]   Aren't we being apologists though?
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.400]   This is such a shock to have this from Apple, isn't it?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.240]   Can you know, give me the Dalmatian colors.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.520]   I'm Mac and then made the--
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:08.960]   Exactly.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.400]   Yeah, the flower power I'm Mac.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.800]   How well did that sell?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.080]   I'm guessing it wasn't the top seller.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.080]   Well, they didn't want this.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.600]   It doesn't.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.280]   I mean, people are accessorizing all of their iPhones
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.040]   anyway with cases and all kinds of other stuff.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.960]   I mean, it's just Apple making money on it instead.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   All right, there's one.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.320]   People play to their egos, too.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.560]   I mean, one of the biggest criticisms
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.160]   we keep hearing is that people are like, oh, no one's
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.560]   going to know I have the new one.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.880]   I need people to know that I have the new one.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.560]   That's a big--
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.800]   It is a big thing.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.680]   Usually, Apple-- I mean, come on, Andy, you're the guy who
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.920]   says, puts Apple up on the pedestal.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.480]   Say, Apple wouldn't do that.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.680]   They don't need a pander, right?
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.280]   I don't-- well, no, this is--
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.520]   I don't think this is pandering at all.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   I mean, if they have numbers saying
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.880]   that this is a really, really popular color,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.760]   and they are thinking that perhaps black and white
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.720]   is getting a little too boring for their taste,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.480]   and if, as rumor has it, there's
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.520]   going to be another phone that has lots and lots--
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.040]   less expensive and have lots and lots of colors.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.720]   Isn't it smart to sort of extend that conversation by saying,
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.440]   and we've decided to add a third color to the iPhone, top
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.160]   of the line iPhone 5S as well?
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.800]   I don't think that's a bad thing at all,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.520]   giving people options to have something that's a little bit
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.640]   more personal and a little bit more to their taste.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.040]   That doesn't mess around with anything.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.880]   The problem comes when they decide to--
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.080]   we're going to make a stylish new phone,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.600]   because it has to look visually different from the last one,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   or else people won't have that sort of premium brand.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.000]   Hey, I'm part of the best and the brightest.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.400]   I don't care that I was-- I still
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.920]   had 12 months left on my contract.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.680]   I paid the fee because I want to be
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.000]   seen as having the new version of the iPhone.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.120]   I don't think that's that at all.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.960]   I think it's just that if gold looks cool, if they built one,
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.760]   and everyone in the room said, wow, that's cool,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.560]   we want to make that.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.680]   That is a definite Apple decision.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.400]   All right, all of this is just color, just cosmetics.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.520]   Let's get down to the nitty gritty, the nub of the matter,
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.840]   the fingerprint reader.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.680]   Yes.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.480]   Now you say now it's no longer an Audi, Renee Richie.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.400]   It's an inny?
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.280]   It was never going to be.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.560]   That was one part of the report that--
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.720]   so the last I heard a few months ago,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.000]   they were like 80% of the way there.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.440]   And Mark Herman had an excellent article up,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.400]   saying that the reason it didn't leak a lot
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.960]   was because it was being tested externally
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.840]   through a little cable.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.920]   And now the gold iPhone prototype
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.520]   actually has it built into the device,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.800]   and they're testing it that way.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.520]   And it's not a swipe, it's not anything fancy,
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   it's just your finger on the home button.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.280]   It looks pretty much the way you expect a home button to look.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.400]   My only question is how Apple balances the reliability,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.440]   because the more points you try to detect,
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.920]   the higher likelihood for error when someone's just
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.080]   trying to use it quickly, or you have a lot of different kinds
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.600]   of people trying to use the phone.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.960]   But apparently it's in the prototype,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.200]   and it looks like it's good for the pipeline.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.280]   From Mountain Lion 2, what's the cat's name?
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.960]   I'm hoping for Sabretooth.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.280]   I like it.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.840]   Although wasn't the original--
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.480]   Oh, that would have been good.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.000]   They had the saber tooth.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.280]   It should have been the first one.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.320]   No, do you think that sometimes they
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.240]   wonder about, oh, let's like naming a kid
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.600]   and trying to find out, does this name rhyme with any rude word?
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.280]   They're thinking, let's have a list of every stupid tech
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.360]   pundit, like, OK, OK.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.720]   Sent in Mac OS 10.9, Sabretooth proves that Matthew Mac
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.400]   is getting long in the tooth.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.840]   OK, we can't use that damn--
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.080]   Let's not go going to spin this on us this time.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.600]   No.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.440]   The only thing I've ever heard was the voice of reason.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.960]   The not goes this is the light and the shines
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.440]   and causes everything to grow.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.240]   The only thing I've heard is links, which rhymes with finks.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.760]   So I don't know.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.200]   So let's recap.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.600]   There really weren't many surprises.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.040]   A new iPhone or two is here.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.920]   Renee, Richie, you, of course, the keeper of the rumor mill,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.200]   anything that was not in the rumors.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   It's hard, Nelio.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.240]   I mean, if you read the book and then go see the movie,
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.960]   did you spoil the movie for yourself?
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.640]   You put all this information online.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   People don't have to read it, but I think it's almost
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.000]   like a compulsion.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.760]   And there were minor details, especially software things,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.680]   like exactly what they were going to do with the camera app
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.520]   or the pricing for the iPhone 5C.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.480]   I thought was one of the most interesting things.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.720]   But all the major stuff leaks out of the supply chain.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.160]   And also there's references in the beta software
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.960]   that people find.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.200]   And it's really hard to keep a secret now
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.040]   if you go on the internet.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.480]   Take some of the fun out of these events.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.840]   There's take some of the ooh and ah.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.560]   There's no one more thing, really.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.920]   Well, and I think when Tim came on,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.520]   they kind of abandoned the one more thing.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.760]   That was really Steve's trademark.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.240]   And I feel like they didn't want to continue with that.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.680]   And say, no, that's a bygone era.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.800]   Let's just announce what we have to announce
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.440]   and call a special event when there's that one new thing.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.680]   So you can go to the Apple Store now, but you can't order.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.000]   Well, we'll just run down real quickly with the announcements.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.440]   We're two new iPhones and iPhone 5C,
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.040]   which is as predicted, a plastic backed,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.400]   essentially iPhone 5, unchanged iPhone 5.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.840]   That you can pre-order September 13th in the US, Canada,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.600]   China, interestingly, Germany, England,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.200]   you know, the usual suspects.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.120]   They'll have it in 100 countries by the end of the year.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.760]   But as you say, the price a little bit disappointing
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.640]   if you were looking for a much less expensive iPhone.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.080]   In fact, I thought, and I think Renee,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.560]   you postulated this as well, that the 5C would mean
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.240]   that Apple could eliminate the 4S from their product line
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.480]   and move everybody to the 5 platform for iOS 7.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.560]   Not the case.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.080]   They are still offering an iPhone 4S.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:52.480]   That'll be the free phone, $99 subsidized for the 5C,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.680]   $199 subsidized for the 5S.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.360]   The unsubsidized price of the 5C,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.040]   the so-called inexpensive iPhone,
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.400]   is only $100 less than the 5S.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.160]   Yeah, that's--
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.760]   549.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.320]   I think that's a surprise because, you know,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.520]   I thought this event, the play would be
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.240]   that this is really about Apple expanding the market
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.120]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.560]   One, the less expensive iPhone,
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.200]   the security because they wanted to get into the military
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.680]   and other markets like that.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.560]   If the unsubsidized phone is really up to 550,
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.080]   I think it makes it still a tough sell in China, in Europe,
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.480]   where people are not accustomed to having contract phones,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.560]   but instead they do buy their phones, unsubsidized.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.360]   And there are clearly other manufacturers
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.200]   that are coming way under that price.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.360]   Anokia, for one.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.520]   Yeah, this is-- well, nobody thought that Apple would make
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.440]   a really cheap phone.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.640]   In fact, there was a pretty good argument
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.400]   that they shouldn't, that that's not how Apple does things.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.200]   But a number of analysts said, if you can get it down
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.080]   to 350 bucks as an unsubsidized or prepaid phone,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.200]   that you will have a huge market for it.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.760]   They didn't.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.320]   Is that a surprise, Renee?
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.520]   It's not a surprise.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.360]   I mean, if you followed Apple for any length of time,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.520]   you know, that they really don't care to have every customer.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.680]   They know exactly which customers they want,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.160]   and they're customers that are willing to spend
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.360]   a certain amount of money on a product.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   If you looked at the iPod Mini, the Mac Mini,
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.720]   the iPad Mini, most recently, their pattern
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.120]   is to take a little bit of money off the price.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.800]   You know, they have a certain share of the market,
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.320]   and they know that by reducing it $100 or $200,
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.880]   they can increase that addressable market a little bit.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.800]   There was one spec bump that surprised me.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.640]   The FaceTime camera now gets a backlit, illuminated sensor,
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.440]   and I think it's a little bit better on the micron scale.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.040]   But it's essentially an iPhone 5 that
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.000]   has a plastic back, which means it's easier to manufacture
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.120]   because they had a lot of problems with the anodization
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.240]   on the 5.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.640]   So it depends what problem you think Apple was trying to solve,
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.400]   and that problem was never going to be offered
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.640]   a $200 or $300 iPhone.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.800]   Five colors, white, red, yellow, blue, and green.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.120]   And then Apple, seeing, I think, a lot of money
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.160]   slipped by them, and the brisk accessory market
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.040]   has decided to offer complementary colorful cases
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.440]   with holes in them so that you can mix and match the colors
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.080]   and have the holes shine through with another color.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.160]   It is an A6 chip, 8 megapixel eyesight camera.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.480]   That's the new camera in the front,
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.680]   4-inch retina display, LTE.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.880]   It's basically an iPhone 5 with the exception
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:33.720]   of that eyesight camera, the old chip, no fingerprint reader.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.440]   The price is the thing that does a little bit surprise me.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:43.400]   Unsubsidized, SIM-free, 16 gigabytes, $549, 32 gigabytes,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.800]   600, 49 dollars.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.440]   I don't think we know what it's going to be in China yet.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.480]   I mean, that's a big question because if China mobile goes
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.560]   through, we don't know what the subsidy deal or the contract
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.880]   between them would be.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.760]   And it's hard to imagine this will be a $550 phone
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.520]   on China mobile.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.840]   That was a little bit of a surprise.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.720]   We thought maybe they would mention China mobile.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.080]   This has been the other shoot a drop in China.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.520]   That's the biggest carrier in China,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.200]   and they have not been on China mobile
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.960]   because of their restrictive demands of Apple Apple
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   wasn't willing to see them.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.960]   And I don't know if they've made that deal or not.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   Well, I was wondering, in the stream to China,
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.760]   there was just a little footnote there saying, by the way,
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.160]   don't tell other people, but this is where the charge is for it.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.520]   Because obviously, they want that market.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.920]   And at this price point, I don't know.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.880]   They did make a big deal about it being the most widespread LTE,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.720]   like the most compatible LTE device, sorry, phone ever.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.320]   And they did announce entity.como in Japan,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.400]   which previously not carried the iPhone.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.680]   So they are at least pushing those international boundaries
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.920]   still.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.120]   So that's because of the technology catching up.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.560]   All the phones now are having are able to--
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.160]   and I know you talked to Sasha Segan
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.480]   of this about this on PC Magazine on your iMore podcast.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.640]   All of the phones now, thanks to Qualcomm and other chip
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.120]   manufacturers, are able to support far more LTE bands.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.000]   And that's very important.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.480]   You don't want to make multiple phone models.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.640]   Currently, Samsung does.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.840]   They have a Qualcomm chip in the US models
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.960]   and an Exynos Samsung chip in the international models.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   And that's because of the different radio bands.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.040]   And the certification processes are really
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.440]   onerous in some jurisdictions as well.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.560]   But there's 40 discrete segments to be supported in LTE.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.600]   And that's hard to get on one chip.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.120]   Because everyone uses-- like, there's not that many bands,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.680]   but everyone uses a slightly different part of that band
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.760]   because there's a range there.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   And then some people have wide supports,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.440]   and people have narrow support.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.160]   It's much trickier.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.240]   It's like-- it really is a black science to get it done.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:41.080]   So it says pre-order September 13 on the 5C chat.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.720]   We have Mr. Naco on the line.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.440]   Hey, good news.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.680]   Andy Inako, who's at?
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.120]   One in Finet-Lope, he's at the town hall where he's--
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.520]   have you been up to the demo room, Andy?
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.120]   I'm in the demo room right now, as a matter of fact.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.880]   Tell us what you see.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.240]   Ah, ah, big crumb.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.120]   Good people.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.840]   I think that this is going to be like site 0 forever.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.600]   Next pandemic disease comes in because everybody's putting
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.200]   their fingers on this exact same, like,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.360]   1 square centimeter area of five different sample
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.720]   life on five S's.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.400]   How to try out the fingerprint authentication.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.480]   It's working well enough that they're just letting everybody--
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.840]   a guy's there to guide you.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.440]   But everybody can basically train their own fingerprints
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.000]   and see how well it works.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.080]   That's pretty impressive that you could train it so quickly
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.880]   that you can test it and train it while having
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.440]   a few minutes with the phone.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.320]   Yeah, and it doesn't work just fine.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.920]   I mean, it's a really cool Apple interface, too.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.360]   When you set up a-- when you train it for your fingerprint,
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.320]   there is a grayed out fingerprint on the screen.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   And what you're-- what it asks you to do
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.440]   is keep tapping and holding, tapping and holding,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.000]   tapping and holding that button with the same finger.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.080]   And the more it learns, the more of those gray loops
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.880]   and the whirls and that fake fingerprint
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.240]   gets filled in with red.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.400]   So you know that, OK, I don't have to do this for 10 hours.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.000]   It's getting more and more red.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.960]   I'm closer and closer to success.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.240]   And once you're done, then it asks you to--
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.000]   now please try holding this with, like, other edges
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.840]   of that same finger.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.240]   So I know what the side of your thumb looks
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.200]   like with a bigger thumb feel like.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.000]   There is-- once you've got it registered in,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.960]   there is a brand new sort of semi-gesture to learn
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.640]   that I screwed up when I first tried it.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.720]   You click the home button as usual to wake it up,
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.880]   but then you will lightly rest your finger on the home button
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.720]   without depressing it in order to get the authentication.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.800]   So when I was doing this, I was pressing and holding
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.520]   and activating voice command time and time again.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.960]   But once you've got it headed to your head,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.360]   click one, it wakes up the phone,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.920]   resting it, and authenticate you, now you're in.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.360]   And it only takes like a half a second for you to go in.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.080]   You don't suppose you have to tap and wait.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.360]   So it works really good.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.400]   You can authenticate as many as five fingers.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.480]   And I tried doing it with, like, not the hand that I'd
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.280]   authenticated with.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.400]   It wouldn't let me in.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   So it seems you're doing really sweet.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.640]   Apple says they're going to use this.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.520]   We'll talk more about the 5S in a little bit.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.800]   This is a 5S-only feature.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.440]   But Apple says they're going to use this not only
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.320]   for unlocking the phone, but also for authentication
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.440]   on the Apple Store, the App Store, the iTunes Store.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.240]   That means they trust it enough to say, yeah,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.040]   this is as good as a password.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.560]   Yeah, that really surprised me.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.320]   I was pretty sure it was going to be using for unlocking.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.480]   I kind of thought that not that they wouldn't trust it
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.400]   for e-commerce, but I thought that at least you want to see,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.160]   well, let's get 5 million people using this first,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.520]   just to satisfy ourselves that it's OK to unleash the hounds.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.200]   But yeah, they're confident enough about it
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.720]   to make this a day one feature.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.320]   That's really impressive about how much they feel about it.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.880]   And also, I think it really does speak to how much CPU
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.160]   power is in the new A7 processor.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.600]   I mean, every single thing they put into that presentation
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.720]   today was fueled by the fact that they've got an amazing horsepower
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.800]   CPU inside that phone.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.840]   Yeah, we'll talk more about that in a little bit.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.760]   Let me get just while you're there in the demo room,
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.280]   any other impressions did you get to play with the camera?
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.680]   Not yet, because there's still a big crowd,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.440]   and it's hard to see how the whole of the camera works.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.880]   I did check out the flash.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.720]   The flash certainly looked like an immediate improvement
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.520]   over when I'm exposed.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.920]   I usually expect them an iPhone.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.720]   Instead of that weird, greenish, bluish color,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.120]   it seems nicely balanced.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.960]   It still has the same problem where it's an LED,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.680]   so it's not quite so powerful.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.640]   But you're already immediately getting really nice, natural color.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.720]   As far as the other things that the camera promises to do,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.600]   I'm just not in the position to really check that out.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.800]   Yes, I don't want to say.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.320]   Yeah, the demo photos, they look very good.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.160]   Apple's saying they have dual LEDs,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.280]   one on the blue end of the spectrum of the color spectrum,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.320]   and one in the warmer, yellow end of the spectrum,
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   and that they can mix the two to give you a flash
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.960]   that matches the ambient light of the room
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.840]   up to a thousand different settings.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.600]   That's what they said.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.360]   So, very variable power for each one,
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.320]   so a variable color, really cool stuff.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.240]   That's a great idea, and I don't think anybody's doing anything
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.720]   anywhere near like that.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.920]   What were your impressions of the presentation itself?
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:14.320]   Again, typical Apple presentation, really tight, really focused.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.840]   They know they have our attention
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.120]   for the first 15 minutes, no matter what they said.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.840]   So, that's a good opportunity to talk about how happy they are
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.600]   to be in so many international markets.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.520]   They showed off the new, the revamped Stanford store.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.400]   I think that we're going to be not too long before we see them
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.000]   be proud about the revamped San Francisco store.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.840]   But really, it was two or three very, very concise messages
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.160]   that were repeated over and over again
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.840]   through implementation in different ways,
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.560]   meaning that we have this hot, hot, hot new processor
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.120]   that lets us do a million things better.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.960]   Like again, you could spend so much time
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.360]   just talking about the camera where it's doing things like,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.440]   well, we're going to sort of pre-take every version
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.200]   of this photo when you click the shutter,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   and then we're going to combine the best parts
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.160]   of every single iteration of that photo
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.040]   to give you the best possible picture.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.480]   So, although they're not doing something as cool as Noki
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.560]   is doing with that immense like 10, 20, roomy-a-sensor,
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.880]   they're saying, "Well, we're going to make
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.040]   a marginal improvement to the hardware,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   but we're going to open up the potential
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.000]   of this really cool CPU to build a synthetic image
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.560]   that's better than anything we could do for real."
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.520]   And the other secret message was,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.400]   international, international, international.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.640]   One thing was we all know that they're talking about
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.600]   the 5C being, "Here's our inexpensive phone
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.960]   for international markets."
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.480]   But the other thing is that they also made sure
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.520]   that everybody knew that this has more radios in it
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.080]   than any other iPhone we've made,
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.200]   and that's the 5C.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.720]   And that's their way of saying that this is a truly
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.440]   international phone.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.000]   And just to make sure that I get this into,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.440]   I did spend some time at the 5C.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.360]   It definitely underscores the point that plastic cases
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.760]   are not the problem badly designed
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.000]   plastic phones are the problem.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.880]   It feels, it doesn't feel like a plastic case
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.680]   because of that steel frame.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.000]   My fingertips are sort of telling me that,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.120]   "No, this isn't plastic.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.240]   This is enamel metal."
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.000]   That instead of plastic, it really feels like a solid,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.400]   well-made item.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.960]   Does it feel like the plastic on the Nokia phones,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.920]   that kind of soft touch polycarbonate or something else?
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.480]   No, again, it feels, to me, it feels more like enamel.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.120]   I wouldn't call it slippery,
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.200]   but it has a sort of a hard articulate,
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.160]   but it's sort of like dense feel to it.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.000]   It doesn't have a pebble surface to it,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.520]   doesn't have a rubbery texture to it.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.960]   Like I said, enamel is as close as I can get
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.080]   to explain the feel of it.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.400]   In effect, that doesn't feel like a $99 phone either.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.120]   It is kind of in effect a coating around
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.800]   on an enamel metal frame.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.920]   Yes. Yeah.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.600]   Anything else, Andy, before we let you go,
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.920]   'cause I'm sure you wanna get back over there
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.360]   and play with those phones tomorrow.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.880]   (laughing)
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.680]   Not much, again, I got the shake, I was Costello's hand.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.600]   That was pretty cool.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.680]   Got the shake Tim Cook's hand,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.920]   which I've never actually met him before,
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.320]   so now I've met Tim Cook.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.560]   I met the vice president,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.680]   so this has been a very good day for me.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.520]   Somehow coming up with the right thing to say
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.720]   that didn't make me sound like an app
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.280]   to somebody that I really, really respect.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.680]   You shook Al Gore's hand, Tim Cook's hand,
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.360]   and Elvis Costello's hand in one half hour period.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.160]   That's pretty darn impressive.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.920]   That was, well, again, I was meant to say,
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.680]   and not embarrass myself, but you know what?
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.400]   Leo, the day's still young, I'm sure.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.240]   (laughing)
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.720]   It looks like a total jerk.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.440]   Most of the known world.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.520]   All right, hey, thank you so much.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.200]   Andy Inako, he's there at the town hall
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.400]   in Cupertino, California, where Apple
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.880]   has just announced two new phones.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.760]   We'll let you go, Andy.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.960]   Go play with, you get your choice.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.680]   Go play with Elvis, Al, Tim, or the phone, your choice.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.040]   My new close personal friends.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.120]   (laughing)
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   Thank you, Andy Inako.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.160]   Great to have you here on the West Coast.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.120]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.960]   If you are in the need for some holiday cheer
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.800]   for your website, a menu, a blog.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.200]   Shutterstock is the place to go
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.320]   with over 30 million royalty-free stock photos,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.840]   illustrations, vectors, and videos.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.320]   I'm a big fan of Shutterstock.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.760]   I know you have heard us talk about it before.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.720]   Have you set up your Shutterstock account?
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.040]   So you can make your Shutterstock light box.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.800]   Here's one for a 2014.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.880]   This is appropriate.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.000]   Happy New Year.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.040]   Oh, look at these, these are great.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   The thing about Shutterstock is, of course,
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.800]   there's 30 million images, but there's another
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.480]   10 to 20,000 images every single day.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.580]   Images from talented artists,
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.640]   each of them vetted for quality,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.200]   and offered to you in a royalty-free form.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.240]   You can either buy image packs or subscribe,
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.040]   but for free, you can create a light box.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.640]   This is a light box of 2014 images, for instance.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.320]   Go to Shutterstock.com and take a look
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.240]   at the amazing search engine.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.600]   Allows you to search for all kinds of topics,
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:02.280]   of course, holidays, but then you can add an adjective.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.880]   You can say, "I just want photos, or just want vector art.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.280]   "I want the orientation to be horizontal.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.400]   "I want it to be, and you even got a color picker,
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.680]   "to fit my palette.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:17.000]   "And now I'm gonna get all the horizontal magenta
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.880]   "vector illustrations for the holidays."
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.520]   And it did, it worked.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.840]   Now, the reason you might wanna create a free account,
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.080]   you don't need to give them a credit card,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.800]   is 'cause then you can use a light box,
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.120]   so you can save images that you like.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.120]   You can also share those images with somebody else.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.440]   It's really nice to have a Shutterstock account.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.760]   I don't know how often you're gonna wanna
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.120]   look for magenta vector holiday art,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.400]   but if you wanted to, you could.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.240]   Very powerful search engine.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.720]   Don't forget the footage too.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.720]   Really beautiful stuff.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.520]   We use it all the time.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.400]   That's how we did press the S key.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.640]   We'll put snow on me.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.880]   A lot of these clips are,
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.640]   "Oh, wait a minute, here's better snow.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.400]   "Let's have this snow fall on me."
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.120]   Can we do that instead of the other snow
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   that we were using?
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.120]   This is great 'cause it's keyable.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.640]   It's got a track mat.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   High def,
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.280]   variety of stuff.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.040]   And when you create a Shutterstock account,
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.800]   you can even get free footage every week.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.960]   I think Shutterstock's great.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.800]   I know you'll like it too.

[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.440]   So Andy.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.160]   - Darling.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.280]   - Sweetheart.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.400]   You, my friend, you have admitted now publicly,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.320]   something that I've suspected for some time.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.800]   You no longer use the iPhone as your day to day telephone.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.120]   - I got a quote, Nathan Lane here.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.680]   I didn't feel as though I need to have
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.720]   any sort of dramatic coming out.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.240]   I feel that people sort of assumed, well,
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.160]   he's male, he's single,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.680]   he likes to customize and modify electronics.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.600]   I mean, he just makes sense, doesn't it?
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.880]   (laughing)
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.560]   - And he does have an awfully colorful house.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.320]   So you wrote an article for techhive.com.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.880]   And which you say, I've given up the iPhone
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.400]   and I am now a Samsung Galaxy S3 user.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.200]   - Yeah, and it's a piece I've been writing for like,
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.440]   believe it or not, like three or four weeks now.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.680]   This is part one.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.920]   It's gonna be in three parts,
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.720]   arriving every morning on tech hive in Macworld.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.520]   Sort of, it's, and as I said,
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.240]   like in the very, very introduction,
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   hoping that people would actually read past
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.800]   like the first paragraph of it,
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.200]   that this isn't a piece about why anybody
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.600]   should switch from the iPhone.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.800]   It's not definitely not a piece about
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.120]   like what Apple is doing wrong.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.400]   It's just a piece about a guy who got a phone.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.760]   The reasons why Android is a better choice
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.400]   for me personally right now.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.080]   And I thought that by being really careful about,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.840]   well, here's the four things about Android
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.960]   that really got me to switch.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.120]   Here are the things I was worried about Android
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.320]   that didn't turn out to be true.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.760]   Here are the things that are turned out
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.560]   to be absolutely true that are problems,
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.280]   but they're not such a big deal
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.640]   that they trump everything else.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.040]   Because unfortunately, I think the water's been polluted
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.560]   a bit in the past year,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.480]   where people who want to really want to see Apple fail
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.840]   and fail hard.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.080]   And so there are a lot of people who would like to,
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.320]   who keep kind of flooding the common boards and blogs with,
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.040]   well, here's why I'm giving up on Apple.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.120]   They no longer innovate and they're no longer easy to use.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.360]   And that's really not the case here.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.800]   I just, I think that if there's a way to summarize
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.280]   that 6,000 words, it's just that I think that Apple
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.800]   in the past couple of years has been a little bit more
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.600]   aggressive in targeting a specific kind of consumer.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.640]   Someone who really well is willing to take whatever is given
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.760]   them if it's well designed, who doesn't really mind
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.920]   if they don't have quite so much choice about it,
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.160]   who will take options that are hardwired in
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.360]   and they don't really, doesn't really matter so much
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.800]   to them to customize the experience
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.560]   to make a better fit for them.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.360]   And who don't really have a whole lot of demands
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.320]   about the design, the physical design of a phone.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.320]   So if you're willing to simply take the operating system
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.520]   that's given to you, accept the behavior
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.720]   of the operating system as it's delivered to you,
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.520]   and then simply deal with the fact that there is going
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.760]   to be one phone a year, one design, one concept,
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.480]   take it or leave it, that's gonna work great for you.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.000]   For me, the way that I use a phone,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.480]   which is as a very, very active device,
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.680]   I mean, this really is a post PC device in my pocket.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.920]   I'm using it all the time to capture data,
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.000]   capture ideas, manage projects.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.680]   It's what I use when I'm not actually behind a keyboard
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.880]   and I'm actually still getting actual work done.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.800]   For that kind of stuff, I just find that the iPhone
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.200]   was just wanting on a bunch of different levels.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.640]   And I'm in the unusual position,
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.240]   I mean, most of the people is a conversation
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.300]   or in this position, where they get an opportunity
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.840]   to try out pretty much everything.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.640]   And I get everything, pretty much every phone
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.960]   that's every big name phone that's ever released.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.320]   They get to try it for a couple of weeks to a month.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.840]   And that's just the last year I found that every time
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.120]   that I have to put the phone back in the box
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.760]   and send it back to the manufacturer
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.520]   and switch back to the iPhone,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.120]   I was like, oh, the screen's a little bit small, isn't it?
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.840]   Oh, remember how easy it was to take a text clipping
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.640]   and make turn into an ever node clipping?
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.040]   Oh, wasn't it nice to be able to set up a custom desktop screen
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.760]   that had really everything I needed to it?
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.560]   But this is nice too, it's beautiful and it's simple
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.000]   and it's easy to use.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.520]   So really, that's all it's about.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   I felt as, I run into a lot of people
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.600]   who are in that same sort of category.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.520]   And I thought that by, I could have just made it
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.840]   into a little like 800 word.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.920]   Yeah, I'm switching, I like the Galaxy S3
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.680]   and I'm really happy with it right now.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.920]   I thought that if I were able to talk about this
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.560]   in great detail, it would help a lot of people understand
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.000]   either why they should cast their net a little bit wider
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.080]   or why switching from the iPhone
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.400]   is probably not gonna be the best decision for them.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.400]   And I've gotten a lot of feedback over that article so far.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.320]   Yeah, like Bob Dylan going electric somebody said.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.200]   Oh God, I got a new one just quite curious, Andy.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.040]   Yeah, well I knew that something was up
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.880]   when I tweeted that it was posted early this morning.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.640]   I tweeted out the link at like a little after nine.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.400]   I checked back like at nine 20
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.720]   and it wasn't just the number of like retweets
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.400]   and like comments, it was one, two, three.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.800]   I see retweets in five different languages.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.640]   Okay.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.760]   Ooh, okay.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.280]   But you will in part three talk about the downsides of Android.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.880]   So Apple fans can stay.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.600]   Yeah, I mean, the structure is in detail.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.920]   I go over the four things that really made me switch to Android.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.800]   The four features of Android that really attracted me.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.680]   There's in the last part I'm talking about the stuff
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.440]   that people often say is the reason why they don't use Android.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.120]   The reason why Android is a terrible system.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.000]   And it turns out that those things are not really true.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.040]   The reasons why it is actually a disadvantage.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.080]   And then I talk a little bit about why Apple,
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.680]   I think is getting so much flak over,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.120]   you know, why you're not innovating enough
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.480]   and you're being left behind, which is again, not true.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.400]   Well, some of this was a little bit defensive
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.840]   and it's part of the reason why I decided to take some time with this.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.000]   'Cause I knew that there were a lot of people who were just going to see the headline
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.680]   that, hey, I'm switching from iPhone to Android
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.600]   and think I was just linkbaiting or just, you know,
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.880]   trying to be a rabble rouser.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   No, you don't know.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.160]   There's reasons why I do things.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.600]   As I've said before, I think that you should love the features
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.800]   that a device gives for you.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.200]   You should love the way that it makes your life easier and simpler.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.240]   You shouldn't love the company that makes it.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.600]   Because if you don't love yourself.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.440]   Exactly.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.080]   I love, for five years, I love the iPhone,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.360]   for the features that it delivered.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   And if I found myself that I was sticking with the iPhone
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.680]   just because I love Apple and I've been an Apple user
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.200]   since I was in middle school, then I'm kind of a dope.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.240]   What could--
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.960]   And I'm sure Johnny Ive and Tim Cook will be listening carefully to this.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.840]   What could Apple do to win you back with the next iPhone?
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.320]   Well, of course, there are rumors that there's going to be a large--
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.520]   one of them is that I really, really do miss having
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.680]   a larger screen phone.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.800]   And this is the four-point in screen.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.960]   It was just so hard to switch back to the smaller screen.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.200]   When I had actually been thinking about this for a number of months,
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.040]   I was really waiting to see, well, what's iOS--
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.720]   what is happening to deliver with iOS 6?
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.560]   What's the iPhone 5 going to be like?
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.440]   And really, one of the main things I was hoping for
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:48.600]   is give me a properly big screen, because it's something that
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.000]   just enhances my mobile experience inestimably.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.480]   I mean, have you ever read an opinion online that is so completely
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.720]   out of whack with your own experience that for a moment,
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.400]   you doubt your own recollection of your own feelings?
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.000]   Because it's just, wait, is 2 plus 8, 11?
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Maybe-- have I just assumed it's 10?
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.400]   And you see so many people claim that, oh, well,
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.360]   the larger screen, it's actually just a marketing gimmick
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.000]   that gullible consumers are swooned by in the showroom
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.720]   and doesn't actually show you more information.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   Yeah, it does.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.680]   It's a little bit more.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.600]   But it's not just that.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.480]   I like the fact that it's so easy to move information
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.360]   between apps instead of having to do a cut copy and paste, which
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.160]   is how you usually have to do it on the iPhone.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.560]   And there are a bunch of other things that are in the articles.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.360]   But if Apple really needs to make a lot of changes,
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.840]   not just to the hardware, not even just to iOS,
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.120]   they really have to change their attitude.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.840]   Again, I'm not saying their attitude isn't as bad right now.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.360]   I'm just saying that they really are focused towards a consumer who
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.600]   really wants to take the thing out of the box,
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.400]   power it up, charge it up, put their phone,
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.320]   their contacts in it, and go.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.560]   Well, I'll give you a good example of an area that Apple--
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.200]   you and I might want Apple to change, but Apple will not ever
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.360]   change.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.320]   And that is the openness of the system.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.200]   So you mentioned a little bit with the sharing menu in Android,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.720]   which can be extended by any app.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.680]   But of course, it's limited by Apple intentionally
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.920]   to Twitter and Facebook because they can control it.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.000]   Similarly, you mentioned that you can use different keyboards.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.600]   Apple won't let you do that for good reason,
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.280]   because a third-party keyboard can capture keystrokes.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.120]   And if it's malicious, send it back to the bad guys.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.720]   And so this closed ecosystem that Apple's created,
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.680]   where they don't give API access to, for instance,
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.560]   your text messages while Android does,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.400]   means that there is some functionality missing.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.920]   I use an Android plugin for Chrome called MightyText.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.520]   It lets me send and receive my texts on the phone,
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.920]   also on my desktop.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.600]   Apple controls that tightly with messages.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.240]   If you don't like the message experience, too bad,
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.400]   because Apple rightly, I think, says there's
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.080]   a potential for misbehavior if we let other people write
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.280]   to the text message.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.680]   There's also some technical reasons behind a lot of this.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.440]   I've had Android since the G1.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.120]   I most recently have an XS4 now.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.040]   But both these devices came from very different backgrounds.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.080]   When the iPhone was created, it was unclear.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.360]   It was ever really meant to run third-party apps.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.680]   And it wasn't-- Springboard is one giant lump.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.560]   It's not architected in a way that
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.800]   makes it easy to do things like multitasking, or contracts,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.880]   or intents, or a lot of stuff that Android was built
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.880]   from the ground up to support.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.560]   A lot of that has been added on in layers to iOS.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.600]   But by the same token, Android was originally not
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.720]   meant to be an iPhone-like device.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.480]   And that's why when I use an XS4--
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.920]   and I think I mentioned this before,
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.120]   you put it in developer mode, and you turn on screen redraws,
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.480]   I just see the scroll view being drawn four times,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.520]   because Google hasn't had time to go back and re-architect
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.640]   the display layers.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.520]   I'm a designer by trade, and that really bothers me.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.760]   The interface on Android really bothers me.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.080]   But other people, the functionality on iOS,
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.880]   really bothers them.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.440]   So to Andy's point, it's what annoys you more.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.600]   You'll end up going towards a platform that better suits you.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.360]   What's interesting is, Andy, while you were still using the phone,
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.480]   you always brought up that exact design thing.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.960]   You said that the fit and finish on iPhone
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.840]   is better for both apps and the OS.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.040]   What happened to you on that one?
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.720]   Did you just say, well, I can live with it?
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.520]   Yeah, it's-- and I get into this in greater detail
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.480]   in later sections of the article.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.840]   But it's not a case of Android kicking iOS's butt
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.160]   in category after category after category.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.200]   It's more like there's a point system.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.600]   And the look and feel of the apps got good enough that,
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.520]   although it's still not as good as iOS,
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.520]   it's not a bad look and feel.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.120]   It's not a bad interface.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.400]   And the tone of the entire app market has changed.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.080]   I had a sort of transitional period.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.280]   I'm talking as-- almost as though I'm going through gender
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   reassignment surgery-- there was a time when I was sort of--
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   There was a time of which--
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.040]   He's the Android curious, folks.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.880]   He's not necessarily a long term.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.680]   I was with you.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.800]   I was definitely by phone.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.240]   I was carrying both phones to my pocket all time.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:16.680]   Big phone of--
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.480]   And I was using the Samsung as a Wi-Fi device,
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.240]   because I had no sim in it.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.520]   And I found-- and I'm like, well, I'm
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.600]   going to miss so many of the iOS apps.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.440]   But I found that really--
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.960]   nearly all of the apps that I really
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.040]   care about are multi-platform.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.640]   And in the past 14 to 16 months, companies like Evernote,
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.880]   they're no longer content to have an iOS team and an Android
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:44.400]   team.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.360]   Now they want it to look exactly the same
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.760]   on multiple platforms.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:47.960]   And--
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.680]   I think, though, Evernote does update iOS faster than Android.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.080]   The new features seem to come to iOS first.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:55.600]   Maybe not.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:56.560]   I'd be wrong on that.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.920]   I couldn't say either way.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.720]   But the point is that now the design isn't coming directly
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.760]   from the operating system.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.680]   The design is being dictated by whoever's
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.040]   trying to build this and deploy it on multiple platforms.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.360]   And also, I mean, it's not even to say
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:16.120]   that there are not great looking apps designed for Android.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:21.440]   I mean, I've never really used Google Reader on my iPhone,
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.680]   because I've never found a Google Reader RSS app that I
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.280]   thought was very pretty and very readable and very, very good.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.960]   And now I'm using this app called-- when
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.600]   I found this app called Press, now this
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.760]   is really almost my RSS reader of choice
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.120]   on a desktop iPad or any other device.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.200]   So they really have elevated their game.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.000]   Part of that is that they've finally
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.360]   made that transition.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.800]   Android 4.0, Android 4.1, they really
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.640]   have gotten their developers in line enough to say, look,
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.240]   you can't just simply throw a bunch of crap onto the screen.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.640]   And if it sticks, and if the buttons highlight when you press
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.200]   them, you can't just say, OK, the user interface
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.080]   is done.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.160]   So yeah, a lot of what you have to talk about
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.200]   is when you're talking about the differences between the two
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:07.040]   is that just because Android is not quite as reliable as iOS
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.280]   doesn't mean it's unreliable, just because the apps aren't
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.000]   as pretty as iOS doesn't mean they're not pretty apps.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.600]   And then when you say that they're certainly
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.600]   within close enough to the letter grade of iOS,
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.840]   that now you can look at other things, such as, again,
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.240]   Apple is not willing to give me a true big screen phone.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.640]   Apple is not willing to give me an app switching mechanism
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.200]   and a data sharing mechanism that really, really works.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.000]   There are lots of little things that I find
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.240]   more easier to use.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   Another thing to talk about customization.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.120]   Google has no problem if a developer
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.640]   wants to remap the volume keys.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.960]   This rocker switch is on every single phone
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.960]   to do other things.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.680]   So it's often being used as a page turner device.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.880]   It's often being used for really interesting functions
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.960]   for those situations when you really
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.680]   are in that viewing mode.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.200]   We're just sort of sitting or standing
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.000]   and then just looking at a screen and paging
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.200]   through information.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.080]   And it makes this kind of device a lot easier to use.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:05.440]   Thank you.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.160]   Was it a Trojan squirrel?
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:07.880]   And did you let it in?
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.480]   It must have been a Trojan squirrel.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.280]   And inside it was tiny little nuts.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:13.960]   I had to check.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.960]   Show title.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.080]   I understand why the podcast app sucks.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.880]   But I don't understand why iTunes sucks.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.200]   So I don't think it sucks.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.000]   I just think it's surprisingly--
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.520]   It sucks.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.520]   No, Andy, let's be honest.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.360]   It sucks.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.800]   No, I don't think it sucks.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.920]   I think that there--
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.440]   after defending it by saying it doesn't suck--
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.040]   oh my god, what wonderful praise that is.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.920]   Carve that in gold above the lentil apple.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.800]   I have to vent a little bit at a problem.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.600]   But I was so sure this was a software bug with the first
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.120]   release that I thought--
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.320]   because I'm trying to sink my--
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.560]   I'm going to mention this because I
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.600]   think that a lot of people will suddenly have an aha moment.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.840]   Oh my god, here's how I fix this problem.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:00.240]   I try to sink TV shows that I've purchased onto my iPad.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.800]   When I get to that page in the sync feature of iTunes,
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.880]   it will only show me the first screen full of shows
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.520]   that I've purchased.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.800]   So if I want to sink 30 Rock, I can't do it because I
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.320]   try to scroll down that list and we'll rubber band--
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.920]   You're sinking it wrong.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:21.400]   I kind of am because I assume that just because this scrolling
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:26.560]   list of TV shows responds to like a scroll input that, OK,
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.200]   I guess it just doesn't think that there's more underneath that.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.560]   Here's what was actually happening.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:36.080]   I have to move the mouse outside of that little scroll view,
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.080]   but still inside the window because the entire rest of that
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.440]   scroll list is in like the populated, unseen area of that
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.080]   window.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.920]   So if I scroll the window content, I can see the rest of my
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   TV shows.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.000]   I simply can't scroll the list that exhibits scrolling
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.800]   behavior.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.720]   And this is why I was not sinking anything on any of my
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.440]   TV shows for about a month.
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.280]   Oh, Danny, this is version 11.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.800]   Exactly.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.520]   And you're saying this doesn't suck?
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.600]   I don't have any--
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.040]   I'm saying it's streamlined.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.800]   It's useful for what most people use it for.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.480]   I think that they took a real step backward for it because
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.240]   this is a recurring theme that I tend to harp on, that there
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.320]   are two kinds of ways to make something easy.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.120]   One is the sort of easy features that means you can learn
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:22.880]   this in one day.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.360]   You got it in one day.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.240]   But then there are the sort of features where after you're
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.520]   no longer a newbie, once you're using it month two, month
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.200]   three, year one, year one and a half, year two, that makes it
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.800]   continually easier to use.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.320]   I think that iTunes is a step forward in the first type of
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.520]   ease of use, but definitely step backward in a second.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.920]   I miss the fact that I can't--
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.320]   sometimes you're working on a playlist, but you want to have
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.760]   that window open behind you.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.160]   So as you sort of make your way through things, you can just
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.720]   simply random grab things and toss them in.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.280]   iTunes 11 is optimized towards maybe having three, maybe four,
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.920]   and only occasionally really manipulating them.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.440]   And I can go on for an hour on things I don't like about
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:58.920]   the way it works.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.200]   I don't think it sucks.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.040]   But I think that they are--
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:07.160]   it's such a bold statement about becoming a consumer-oriented
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.200]   company as opposed to a more broad appeal.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.840]   Everybody who likes machines that go Bing does very
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:12.960]   comfortable.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.240]   It's 90-90.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.640]   Well, 90% of the people need 90% of the time.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.280]   Would you agree the podcast app on iOS sucks?
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:20.880]   It sucks.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.040]   OK, thank you.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.080]   It sucks.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:23.960]   See, it's worse.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.400]   It's absolutely useless.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.680]   It does not do the job it was supposed to do.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.560]   Not only that, but it also prevents you from using an
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.640]   alternative.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.440]   What I hated the most about it was that if I have the
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.040]   podcast app on this iPhone, I don't even have the option of
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.440]   saying, well, what if I have a playlist called Greatest
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.040]   Podcast Episodes Ever?
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.680]   So, ever like when WTF did that wonderful interview with
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.240]   Mel Brooks, that goes into a special playlist that says,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.920]   a year from now, two years from now, three years from now,
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:02.000]   that Valkyrie interview on Jeff Goldberg's--
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.120]   excuse me--
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.400]   another podcast.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.680]   But the fact that they were podcasts means that I'm not
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.760]   allowed to listen to them within an iTunes playlist.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.000]   They have to be accessed through the podcast app.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.720]   I think there's a reason to access them.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.280]   I think actually Apple is rejecting podcasts like they
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.600]   would reject a bad organ.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.200]   They're pushing them out.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.520]   And this was always my great fear.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.920]   When Apple started including podcasts and iTunes, it was a
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.960]   great day for us and all other podcasters.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.040]   It really improved our profile.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.040]   But I always made me nervous because we were really
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.120]   dependent on Apple.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.040]   And at this point, I think it's clear that Apple has
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.880]   decided they lost a big patent lawsuit last year on this
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.440]   subject.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.240]   I think Apple has decided-- and they can't do it overtly
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.600]   because they know they'd reach-- they get the wrath of a
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.880]   lot of listeners.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.360]   But they don't want podcasts to be part of iTunes.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.840]   They want to push it out.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.880]   They want to move it over to the side.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.640]   And they want you to ultimately give up on the podcast app
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.880]   and use downcast or some third party app.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.600]   And then eventually they'll kill it.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.440]   And then they can say, hey, we don't do podcasts.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:04.880]   I'll let her in.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.800]   I'm not sure it's that.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.600]   It's not sure it's that--
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.800]   one of the problems Apple is facing with the iOS device is
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.280]   that they're breaking iTunes up into many constituent
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:12.780]   parts.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.880]   And they have an iTunes U app instead of having all the
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.560]   iTunes U stuff in the iTunes app.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.000]   Why do that?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.920]   Well, the iOS ecosystem seems to favor single purpose
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.560]   applications.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.440]   It's much easier.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.960]   iTunes is a monstrosity.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.040]   And part of that on the desktop is because they have to
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.920]   port the whole thing to Windows.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.840]   So everything that they could possibly want to do with an
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.160]   iPhone or music is one gigantic monstrosity.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.520]   But on iOS, it behooves them to have all these different
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.160]   apps because then they can build specific interfaces,
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.040]   especially on the more constrained iPhone screen for
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.200]   those things.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   That makes sense, actually.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.320]   And my understanding is that the people who made the
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.600]   podcast app--
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.240]   Apple has the remote app.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.360]   Or what app did not get updated for a long time because
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.840]   that engineer was taken off--
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.200]   Still sucks.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:53.880]   --give another job.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.640]   And he was brought back to it.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.000]   And the disadvantage of not being part of the music app,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.720]   which has more consistent engineers behind it, is I
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.920]   think there were two guys, an engineer and a designer, who
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.440]   put it out.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.600]   And they seemed really proud of it.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.800]   And other people at Apple seemed really proud of it when
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.200]   it shipped.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.080]   But then they had bugs.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.240]   And they tried to fix the bugs.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.640]   And now they're really busy trying to get iOS 7 out.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.120]   And it's just as much as Apple has nearly infinite resources,
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.360]   billions and billions of dollars, they don't have
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.320]   infinite engineers.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.560]   They are starved for good engineers.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.760]   That's the real question.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.040]   There aren't good people out there.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.640]   Everyone's starved for it.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.040]   Well, if you're in college right now, become a developer
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.960]   because there's a desperate need for not just day average
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.920]   grunt developers.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.360]   There's a desperate need for brilliant--
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.480]   Which take after you get out of college often takes 10
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   years.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.280]   10 years, right?
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.880]   And there was a great program.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.600]   Here's why I think Apple is actually actively trying to
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.800]   kill podcasting.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.880]   Because they lost that lawsuit and they were forced to pay
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.840]   $8 million, they now also licensed it.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.000]   Podcasting costs them money.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.240]   And no one knows how much.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.840]   But day in, day out, podcasting costs them money.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.720]   The ability to subscribe to a podcast on iTunes costs them
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.480]   money.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.480]   And I just think that they're thinking, well, we don't make
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.160]   any money on this.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.680]   We can't charge for podcasts.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.280]   It's costing us money.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:04.880]   Who needs it?
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.600]   But now they don't want to do it overtly.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.800]   But I think that's the thing.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.880]   My sister loves a new podcast app.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.440]   She subscribes to one or two television podcasts at a time
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.280]   when they stop having the television series.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.160]   She gets rid of them.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.560]   And that podcast app is perfect for someone who doesn't use
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.840]   podcast the way that we do.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.120]   It doesn't have a list like Andes that doesn't want to
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:21.960]   sync a ton of stuff.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.440]   If you have four or five podcasts, you happen to like--
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.400]   if you want to use the stations button to find a couple
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.760]   of things that are interesting, it's a fine app for you.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.160]   And Apple just, once again, is not showing interest in the
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.240]   power user segment.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.760]   By the way, Google does a bad job of podcast too.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.880]   Google listens awful.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.400]   Well, it's gone.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.920]   OK, but exactly.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.640]   That's why I disagree with you.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.480]   Google realized that people that they don't need to have a
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.640]   Google Listen app because there are wonderful third party
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.600]   apps out there that do the job just fine.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.200]   Rather than coming out with a half-butted version of it to
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.960]   sort of encourage people not to use it, they simply say, OK,
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.760]   we're not going to update this anymore.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.480]   If Apple really had no interest in any more podcast, then
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.160]   they would simply not have released it or said, OK, we're
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.040]   never going to update this.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.360]   Well, I think that's the next step.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:07.840]   Just kill it.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.320]   I mean, that thing is such a--
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.000]   I think that they--
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.840]   my guess is that when a big company releases a piece of
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.080]   software that's this bad and it is awful, it absolutely
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.000]   sucks.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.480]   The story that I'm usually told by current and former team
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.240]   members a couple or two or three years later, which is that
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.680]   on the whiteboard, this was a huge four-star well-funded
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.520]   project.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.480]   At some point, as they were working on this, it became a
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.360]   zero priority for the company.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.160]   And they just simply were forced to limp this across the
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.800]   finish line and as dignified a fashion as they possibly could.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.880]   So I don't think it's a matter of sabotage.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.080]   I think that it's an indication of a lack of will on Apple to
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.880]   have a really good podcasting app baked right in.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.720]   If we look at the--
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.120]   I mean, it was supposed to come out at WWDC along with all
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.000]   the iOS 6 stuff.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   I believe it was supposed to be showing off on stage and it
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.200]   was late.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.040]   So it got kind of released in between, which was really odd.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.120]   It wasn't at the WWDC and it didn't wait until the iPhone
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.080]   event.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.400]   And Apple, in Guy English, wrote a great article about this I
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.200]   think a year ago about Apple and retention where people and
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.880]   engineers are their biggest problem now because all the
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.160]   early iPhone engineers have had their stock options best.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.720]   All the second generation, the App Store people, all of them,
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.600]   if you look--
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.120]   and I think Gruber picked this up, Dan Frommer wrote about it--
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.520]   over the last few weeks, the amount of people good iOS
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.480]   engineers leaving Apple has gone up.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.360]   So if they're struggling to get iOS 7 out, if they have a
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.680]   constrained amount of engineers, they are not--
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.960]   exactly what Andy said, they are not wasting a lot of them
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.240]   on the podcast.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.000]   And this is why you want to be a brilliant programmer because
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.440]   you'll vest, you'll make millions of dollars, you're
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.560]   going to retire.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.120]   Well, or not only retire, but you're going to make more
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.560]   money building your own apps because you know where they
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:52.560]   side it out.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.720]   And do a startup.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.000]   Do your own thing.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.800]   Build your-- they have their own ideas that no one's
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.560]   listening to.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.800]   The great developers are the--
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.600]   Also, all the standard.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.080]   We're also overlooking the obvious here.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.240]   The reason why there is enough people to work on a podcast
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.200]   app is because those 100 engineers they put on the
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.600]   watch project.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.560]   It must be bigger than we even imagined it.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.640]   Did they announce anything else while I was gone?
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.480]   I know we have a new phone, and I want to thank, by the way,
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.880]   Josh Windish and my staff and his wife, Vanessa, who works
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.840]   at the Apple Store, who probably broke rules to squirrel
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.600]   aside--
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.200]   Oh, no.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.440]   I'm sure it was all about board.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.120]   I-- I-- I passed him.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.320]   I said, I'm sure nobody did anything that would get them
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.840]   censured or fired from their job.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.360]   Leo.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:34.880]   Absolutely not.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.400]   Absolutely not.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.160]   No, no.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.920]   She waited in line for me.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.760]   But this is-- I'm unboxing it right now.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.040]   This is a 5S, the gold.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.000]   And here I learned something interesting today.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.120]   All of you manly men have gold iPhones.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:48.960]   Absolutely.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.160]   What is the story with that?
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.520]   Well, it's--
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.080]   Well, Brian Clogue is the only acceptable color.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.040]   Well, we know it's different, right?
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   I actually want it gold.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.600]   And you know, it is kind of pretty, isn't it?
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.680]   It's more-- yeah, it really is a very subtle, understated,
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.600]   not-- it isn't a--
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.640]   Hey, look how much money I have.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.120]   So much money my phone is made out of gold.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.240]   So it's a-- it's a very classy sort of gold.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   Yeah, it's not super shiny.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.360]   It's-- it's like-- I mean, just like the silver one,
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.400]   this is the gold-colored version of that.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.880]   It's that textured kind of--
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.960]   Yeah, it's a like-- like--
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.200]   It's not like a warm, big, rich gold.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:21.840]   It's just pretty.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.200]   It's totally a distraction.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.120]   The fact that it's still a rounded rectangle, Leo.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.600]   Totally distracts.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.120]   The gold ring around the home button
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:29.880]   puts it over the top.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   And then this is, of course, the new--
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.280]   Touch ID?
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.120]   Is that what they call it?
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:34.880]   Touch ID.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.200]   So of course, I was here when the announcements were made.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.240]   I was here for that event.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.960]   So what I didn't know is how well this Touch ID worked.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.400]   We've had it for a while now.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.600]   What do you think?
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.760]   Is it-- is the fingerprint sensor good?
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   Works like a chamor.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.720]   It works really well, but you have to--
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.200]   you really have to do a good job, I think,
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.520]   when you set it up for the first time.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.400]   Because I think I registered my primary thumb
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.240]   kind of quickly.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.760]   Mike's happened to get it to work.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.360]   And after two weeks later of saying try again, try again,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.760]   I finally wiped all my fingerprints, not off the--
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.200]   my hand off the device.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.600]   And basically did a little bit more deliberately.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.440]   Well, here's where I'm going to be hitting.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.360]   I'm typically going to be touching this button.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.120]   Now I'm doing something.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.200]   Do you guys do this?
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.120]   I'm waiting till it's English.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.160]   Do you guys do that?
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.800]   Because once it's English, then I can swipe it.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.720]   I'm afraid if I swipe it when it's Korean.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.160]   You'll set the language.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.720]   It's just going to stay that way.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.680]   Do you guys do that, or is that just me?
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.080]   That's just you.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.040]   I found the first touch I G set up awkwardly.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.080]   I wasn't used to it.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.560]   I didn't know what I was quite doing.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.240]   It would vibrate.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.560]   I'd pull my finger off too fast.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.040]   I'd put it back too slow.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.400]   It took me a while.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.680]   The second and third time were far better than the first.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.200]   It was-- it tries to explain what you need to do.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.640]   But you've got to--
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.800]   you know, I was like, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.680]   No, that's not how you do it.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680]   You've got to be patient.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.200]   Slow down.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.440]   And it reads it once.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.520]   And then it actually tells you, OK, now shift your position
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.040]   and so that you can get the other corners of your print
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.520]   so that if you're in any kind of weird angle, it's smart.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.320]   I like how they did it.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.680]   It's very friendly, and it works pretty well.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.040]   It's also nice enough to tell you
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.120]   that when you're trying to register your fingerprint,
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.320]   if you're not giving it what it needs,
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.680]   it will actually say, hold it longer now.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.240]   Hold it again.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:16.680]   So--
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.040]   It's the same passive disappointment
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.720]   as original GPS systems would get.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.880]   Is it going to do that at some point now?
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.720]   You have to set it up.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.960]   So when you get through everything,
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.680]   it'll ask you to-- if you want to turn on-- you
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.000]   turn on your passcode, and then you can have it also
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.400]   remember a thumbprint at that point.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.280]   It's tied to the passcode.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.640]   You have to have a passcode as well.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.760]   So you've got another method of authentication.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.960]   That four digit passcode.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.640]   Well, yeah, it doesn't have to be a four digit passcode.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.200]   In fact, when I turn on Touch ID,
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.840]   I went from a four digit passcode up
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.880]   to a much more complicated password,
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.880]   because I don't need to enter it very often.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.800]   So I think it's actually more secure in that way,
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.200]   because my alternate password is much better
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.040]   than the old four digit pin code that I used to use.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.120]   Pardon me for covering old material,
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.520]   because I know you probably talked about this.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.960]   It's new to me.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.160]   But I'm the only one that's new to you.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.600]   And it's not like we--
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.560]   it's like the entire world seems to think
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.960]   that everybody buys a brand new iPhone the first week
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.640]   of release, and then it ceases to become
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.600]   of interest to anybody.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.200]   We're done.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:09.800]   What's next?
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.280]   What's new?
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.560]   We're only arriving in October, Leo.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.720]   This is new for everybody.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.880]   Well, and that was why I was so pleased that Josh put one
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.000]   aside for me, because I did try to order it.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.200]   And it said sometime in October, and I thought, well, God,
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.160]   I don't know if I want to be that out of the loop.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.000]   Faster?
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.840]   Yes.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.340]   Yes.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:27.840]   Possibly.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.440]   No, simply so.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.440]   Super faster.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.760]   Yeah, that's the best device for iOS 7, I think, so far.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.760]   Well, and I noticed that the iOS 7 camera is much different.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.760]   I was able to get iOS 7 on my iPad mini, which I took with me.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.720]   And now on my old iPhone 5, the camera
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.800]   is so much different.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.760]   But I think it really is made.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.520]   It's made for this camera, right?
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.880]   Yeah, I think the processor has a lot to do with it.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:57.280]   The DSP, the signal processor in the chip that's in the 5S,
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.200]   they're using that a lot.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.480]   There's a lot of back end processing happening
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.120]   in terms of what they're focusing on and low light.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.200]   And it's doing a lot of really intelligent stuff,
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.640]   plus the new flash.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.440]   So the processor is not--
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.240]   New flash?
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.280]   New flash right here, finally?
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.040]   No, a flash.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:13.880]   There's two flashes now.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.880]   Double flash.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.280]   All right, so it's now asking me to set up Touch ID.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   So I'll do that, right?
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.280]   Scan the finger of thumb you normally
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.600]   use on the home button on the lefty.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.480]   So I just put it there.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.200]   OK, lift and rest your finger repeatedly.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.360]   And as I do that, it's filling in the little whirls and loops.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.120]   Now, somebody told me it's only taking nine points
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.920]   of similarity, which gives it more reliability than hashes,
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.880]   though, as it doesn't store an image.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.320]   Actually, it was my friend, Chamala, who's a Turkish podcaster,
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.840]   who's also a security expert and has used fingerprint readers
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.360]   for a long time.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.040]   He said, for that reason, it's more reliable.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.320]   But the potential for a collision is higher.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.840]   Right, one in 50,000.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.880]   So big deal, right?
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.840]   Big deal.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.800]   I mean, what's the chance that one of that other guy
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.320]   in the 50,000 is a crook?
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.840]   That's basically the same chances
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.800]   that you'll have an evil doppelganger or anyone.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.720]   Find your fingerprint twin.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.000]   So I've lifted and rested my finger on the home button
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   repeatedly.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   And now it'll just my grip.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.760]   What the hell does that mean?
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.520]   Just hold the phone a little differently, because chances are
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520]   you just--
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.520]   Should I use a different finger?
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520]   No, no, same finger.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.520]   Same finger.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   Same finger.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520]   Same finger.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.520]   Now it's just one thing.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.520]   You need to make your finger forever.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.520]   Well, no, because it'll remember.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.520]   Because it's a different angle.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520]   Yeah, that's it, because you don't always
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.520]   use the exact same angle.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   So it won the--
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520]   Because can I do my right finger?
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   I've now committed to my left finger.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520]   Yes, it remembers up to five.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.520]   Five.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.520]   So this will just be your first one.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.240]   Surely, Bassey's left finger was the one that didn't make it as a hit.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240]   Touch ID is ready.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.240]   It can be used.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.240]   Continue.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.400]   Now, now I have to do a passcode, which I will do.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400]   Don't look.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   And it's very, very smart.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.400]   One, two, three, four.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   Because if you try to--
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   No, but that's--
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   If nobody would guess that, I don't think.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   We won't tell.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.840]   I like the way that they've really defined the fingerprint as a
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.280]   secondary sort of thing.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.760]   Really the passcode is still your primary.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.800]   And if you have not used your fingerprint in a while, or if
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.840]   you've restarted the phone or a couple of the situations, or
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.120]   last for your passcode before, it will let you use the finger
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120]   finger.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   Interesting.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.880]   It's not just a backup, a fallback.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.280]   It's really part of your primary.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280]   Yeah, I think that's good.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.480]   You reboot 48 hours of pass since you last used it, or you fail five times
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.520]   that'll ask you for your passcode again.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520]   So that's it.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:26.680]   Now, if I lock this phone, now the next time I do this to unlock it, I just slide it.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.520]   Well, that's to put in the passcode.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   Or you can just put your passcode back.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520]   Or just do this.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.520]   Oh!
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520]   That's pretty cool.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.320]   It literally means you pull it again and then put down the notification center.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.040]   If I do that again, and now I do the...
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.960]   Now pull down the notification center first.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.400]   Now you can watch the icons fly in from underneath the notification center.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   They call the cool kids.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   Watch the icons.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400]   Put your thumb on it.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400]   Put your thumb back on it.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   Whoo!
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.480]   Oh, I saw them kind of underneath in the translucency.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.160]   I have to say, on iOS 7, I'm not thrilled about it.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.360]   There's a lot of flying in of icons.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.080]   And that's why I think that a lot of people who are thrown off by iOS 7, if you try it
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.080]   on the 5S, that's the first machine I think that's designed.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.360]   So where the animation is so smooth and so natural, it seems to make sense.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.360]   Right.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:25.640]   On my iPads and on my earlier generation iPhones, it's not like it's terrible, but there's
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.040]   enough of a hesitation.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.880]   There's enough of a stutter that I'm noticing things moving in as opposed to something.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   It's more annoying.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880]   Okay, you're right.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.360]   It's not so annoying on this.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.920]   Turns out there's an uncanny valley for these kind of animations.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920]   Isn't that funny?
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.520]   And this one can manage it.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520]   Here's the other thing.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.520]   I'm not crazy about it.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.520]   I'd like to get your take.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.520]   I'm not crazy about the folders.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520]   It was open.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520]   I hate it.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520]   I hate it.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   It's terrible.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520]   It's a mistake.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520]   They need to fix it.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.120]   It's like they've forgotten that the only thing the folders are good for are for launching
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.120]   apps from.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.680]   It's not as though, well, I of course I want to see all the other driving games that are
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.200]   in my folder when I quick it out of that one.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.840]   The home button should be sacrosanct.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.480]   The home button should take me back to the home screen.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.560]   Now whether you're in a folder or a new stand, that's the one that gets me as I'm reading
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.320]   an app in new stand and I press the button to go back to switch to another app and it
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   shows me new stand.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   Don't want that.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.920]   And then I have to press it again to go back out.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.920]   That's just not how the home button should work.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920]   Don't like that.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920]   It's not.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.600]   So people see what I'm talking about for those of you watching.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.080]   So I opened the extras folder and I opened the calculator.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.840]   Now home should and has always in the past brought us home.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.280]   Instead it brings us back to the folder.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.560]   I'm also not crazy about the folder layout.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   I feel like it's a kind of waste of space.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.560]   Although I learned, which is kind of cool, that you can have multiple pages in a folder,
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.200]   which is kind of an interesting idea.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.880]   That could be useful.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.000]   But I'm not crazy about the waste of space there.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.960]   I feel like that's not, it could be a little, but that's a minor.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   Sure.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.360]   I mean, this is such a rethink for Apple that there are lots of things that are weird about
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360]   it.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.800]   One would hope they will be fixing in future updates.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.240]   But you know, they, it's very different.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.480]   You know what I really like?
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.200]   I really like the multi multitasking.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.360]   This is a really nice way to handle it.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.520]   It's very web OS, right?
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.680]   Oh, have we seen this before?
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   I like the icons.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   I think the icons help a lot.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   The thumbnail.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.520]   And the ability to swipe these off or the other thing I just learned, multi swipe them
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520]   off.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.240]   Yeah, the whole, the whole, the whole down until it starts to jiggle and then there's
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.240]   a little tiny X.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.520]   I mean, that's such an unfriendly behavior.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   This is better.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.520]   This is better.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.040]   It's prejudiced against the idea that you would ever force quit an app.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.840]   Whereas people just seem to think, well, we are more naturally proposed to think that,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   hey, I'm done with this.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.840]   I want, I want this gone now.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.400]   The other cool thing is I didn't notice until I was using it for a day or two is that those
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   previews are actually live.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.120]   So if you're playing a video, you will actually see the video continue to play as you, as
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.760]   you cycle through that way.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.080]   I do think the camera is superlative.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.040]   And as much as I've used the other cameras, Moto X at an update, that's what I took to
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.760]   yeah, on my trip, it's, there's nothing like the iPhone five and the five S is even better.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.040]   Well, yeah, that's, they made so many steps forward.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.520]   There's only one step backward.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:16.200]   The reason why I have this up here is that the, the, the burst mode is more useful and
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.920]   more significant on the iPhone than it is on any other camera, any other camera phone,
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.360]   because this will simply shoot two frames per second at the exact same quality.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.280]   It shoots every other picture.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:31.200]   And I actually shot a video of how long can you hold down that, that picked that button.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.760]   So it got 200 and I was like, and when I got back home, I was actually timing it out.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.720]   It shot 230 something shots at 10, 10 frames per second.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.120]   And then it slowed down to about seven or eight and it kept on that until about 500
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.280]   at which point I got bored and stopped.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.400]   So that's, and, and so, I'm, I'm sorry, what I'm getting at is that every time you're shooting
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.080]   an uncooperative subject or you know, you're, you're chasing your kid around and the kid
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   is not going to stop and, and please stand still, please do this or you got a group shot
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.680]   of four or five people and not everybody has their eyes over the same time.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.800]   This, this idea of like holding the phone up and clicking one picture, that's done on
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.040]   the, on the five S. You will almost always want to shoot a burst of 10 or 12 because
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.240]   one of these 10 shots is going to be perfect.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.960]   There's this one is the, I was shooting a burst of the squirrel in the tree and of 30
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.920]   shots there happened to be two in which the pose was kind of okay.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.640]   And the subject was sharp because this was a very, there's like just a half an hour before,
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.880]   before sunset.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.680]   And but if you, if you get one shot at it, you're probably going to miss it.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.160]   But if you take a burst of 10 or 20, you're probably going to find at least one frame
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.640]   that's going to be pretty good.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.280]   There's still one problem that I found with it.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.360]   It's, I don't know why, but it loves low ISO's.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.360]   It will do anything.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:45.200]   It will sell its first child on eBay to take a picture with a low ISO.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.760]   It's because it's less grainy.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.000]   You want it to do that, right?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.280]   Well, but yet, well, it's a little bit, it's going to be a little bit more grainy at a
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.280]   higher ISO.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.480]   But the problem is that so it's saying, well, you're, I, you're inside a library and it's
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.120]   sort of a dimly lit reading hall.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.160]   I can shoot at 64 ISO.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.160]   Can't I?
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.600]   No, I'm going to shoot a 64 ISO.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.000]   No, I really, I'm going to shoot a 64 ISO.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.280]   And if I'm going to, and the shutter speed is going to be one 15th of a second.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.920]   So hold it real, real steady.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.680]   Well, I can't pull it that steady.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:14.280]   So that's why there's, there are a lot of shots in which, if not for the fact that it
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:20.520]   was going for a 64 100 ISO and a long exposure of like one 30th or one 50th, one 15th, it
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.200]   would have taken a better picture than most of the other phones.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.640]   Is there no way to overrule that?
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   None that I know of the, the only trick that I've kind of found that kind of works is that
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.000]   I haven't certified this yet, but I noticed that when I use the flash, it tends to go
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.440]   for a shorter shutter speed, but there's no way to force it to go for a shorter speed.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.120]   Sometimes if you, if you tap and hold on a really dark area, you, you know, you force
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:48.720]   it to adjust to the, to the darkness and it will, it will actually crank the ISO.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.880]   Is that down or up?
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.800]   So, but it's, it's finicky.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   It definitely is finicky.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   Now I can't get that much on.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   That's the one thing I wish they'd fix.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   I'm holding it wrong.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   Oh, there.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   Okay.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   Took four tries.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   We have a new, we have a new, we're holding it wrong.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   Touching it wrong.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.520]   But I want to program a maybe this finger to case, right?
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.520]   Two thumbs and index finger.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.520]   Up to five.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.520]   I've got four of them.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520]   Two thumbs and index finger.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520]   Okay.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.920]   You'll, what, what you'll discover is the, all the different ways you happen to pick
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:18.920]   up your phone.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.920]   Yeah, I just discovered this.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.920]   Yes.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:21.920]   You're right.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.920]   Right.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.920]   Right.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:25.020]   So I, I did my left thumb first and then I used it for a little while and went, oh, also
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.020]   right index finger.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.600]   And then I put it down on my kitchen counter and realized I was waking it up with my right
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:34.480]   thumb and it turns out that I have four really common different ways based on where the
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.000]   phone is that I pick up the phone.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   I had no idea.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.600]   So I can add, oh, it says fingerprint one and I can now add fingerprint.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.400]   So now, okay.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.880]   One of the nice things about that screen is if you touch your, if you touch your thumb
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.120]   to it, yeah, it'll highlight.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.400]   It says, oh, that's finger.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.120]   So you can actually see by touch, which is which.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120]   Which one is which?
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120]   Let me do that again.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.120]   That's cool.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.120]   That's finger one.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   You know what finger two is?
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.960]   No, but there's no, no, people know me a little too well.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960]   Don't they?
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   They know what finger two is.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   That's true.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.920]   So now I'm going to do my index finger because I want to, I want to be able to do that as
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920]   well.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.920]   I notice when I want to take a picture, that's kind of how I hold my phone up.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:24.120]   So I have noticed that the, in general, the, the feeling is that people are very happy.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.520]   Is any negatives?
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.880]   Well, there was the security issue.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   So let's talk about that.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   Vekrene, Richie, you were.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.520]   I'm more, was it you that wrote that article and I'm more?
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.920]   I saw the article in which you said the media got it wrong.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.600]   And made it a security problem when it wasn't, it wasn't one.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   In fact, at all.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   Now I avoided that.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.000]   I've already updated between the time I left.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.160]   There've been two versions of iOS seven, seven or two.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.560]   Alex Lindsay always said, don't use the first version of any Apple OS.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.160]   Don't use the second version.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.160]   Use the third.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.120]   It fixes the problems that the second version added when it fixed the problems with the first
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120]   version.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.560]   But the third by 7.02, it's going to be good.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.560]   So now's the time.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:09.680]   It wasn't so much the updates that it was just, iPhone 5S has these new security features
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.200]   and it has lots of them like activation lock and like touch ID and trusted machine.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.360]   But it also has a ton of new convenience features like control center.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.000]   And you have to choose as a responsible adult user whether you want a really convenient
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.760]   iPhone or really secure iPhone or some middle ground.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.080]   And the problem with the reporting is that they were phrasing in such a way that I was
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.400]   getting continual letters from people like, oh, touch ID doesn't work.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400]   I'm turning it off.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.360]   I'm not going to have a passcode anymore or this is a security flaw.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.800]   And they were doing, they were making choices that degraded their security due to misinformation
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.040]   that was being presented about it.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.840]   And for example, you can use control center to put your iPhone in airplane mode from the
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.840]   lock screen.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:57.000]   And people were afraid that thieves would steal their iPhones, put it in airplane mode
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.800]   and they couldn't track it.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.080]   You can disable that very easily in the settings.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.000]   You can turn Siri off so that Siri only works from the lock screen with touch ID enabled.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.640]   There's all these different settings you can use.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:12.120]   But if that's always been a problem, Siri was always accessible from the lock screen
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.480]   unless you disabled it.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.480]   That's not new.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.320]   And now if you disable it, it's only accessible from the lock screen with touch ID, which
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.000]   I think is a much better choice.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.920]   And there were several things like touch ID can be foiled.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.000]   Well, yes, if you have a CSI level person who goes to the trouble of duplicating your
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.080]   fingerprint in a multi step, not, you know, non trivial process and then happens to get
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.440]   physical access to your phone within the 48 hour window of you last using it with a
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.440]   finger.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.800]   And but it wasn't reported that way.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.680]   It was just reported as, you know, Apple is doomed.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.680]   This stuff doesn't work.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.520]   And that caused a lot of problems.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520]   How?
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520]   Okay.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:49.440]   So, so you would certainly recommend 702, especially if you're Greek because apparently
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.640]   you couldn't.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.400]   The Greek language didn't work properly.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.600]   And I was in Greece.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600]   Who do?
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.920]   By the way, a little observation as I'm going around.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.720]   And I think this is going to be very interesting to see what happens until we got to Turkey
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.400]   where a lot of people had iPhones.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.920]   Almost everybody had Nokia phones.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.320]   I can't tell you how many times I heard do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.920]   Not only do they have Nokia phones, they hadn't updated their ringtone.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.240]   No, no, no, it's like everybody.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.280]   And it's of course, it's because they're less expensive.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.800]   They're cheap kind of candy bar phones.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.600]   And I really wonder with Microsoft buying Nokia, what's going to happen in that world?
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.480]   And that may be a huge opportunity for Apple.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.720]   I think that's why analysts are saying do a cheap phone Apple.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.360]   And that I think maybe it's even more urgent because Nokia's basically, I think, going
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.840]   to kill that market.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.840]   Right?
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.880]   So anyway, just an observation from being somewhere besides the US.
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.040]   I just think that we don't we don't pay enough attention to the I don't care segment of the
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.040]   market.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.160]   The people for whom a phone is just a practical device.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.120]   They have absolutely no emotional connection to.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.360]   And so that's a lot of people had iPhones.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.000]   It was very interesting.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.760]   I will note that my mother who's had a candy bar phone for her entire life asked me today
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.560]   what I was doing with my iPhone 5.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.560]   I finished reviewing it.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.360]   Yeah, there's a market.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.440]   It is Warhol for her does they pop art iPhone?
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.480]   It is, isn't it?
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.480]   All right.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.320]   So battery life, last question, battery life.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.120]   I find it that it's as good as the iPhone 5.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.680]   However, that's dissimilar.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.960]   You're not used to the fact that iOS 7 when you iOS 7 has different sets of default.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.720]   Then iOS 5, excuse me, iOS 6 did.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.200]   So I was getting not as good battery life until I went in and changed all the Wi-Fi
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.680]   settings back to the way that I had them before, all the other notification things
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.320]   back to the way I had them for.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.000]   So I think that it's as good as the iPhone 5 running iOS 6.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   That's good enough.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.880]   Apple seems to be optimizing for the idea that you leave the house in the morning, you
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.280]   work and use it, use the phone a little bit while you're out and then you come home at
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.680]   night and plug it back in.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.280]   Not when you go to bed, but before you.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.040]   And that works for me.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.840]   I have almost never had it drop off before I got home at the end of the day.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.840]   But that's what they're...
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.240]   I want 18 hours.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.040]   This is what Apple, but Apple wants, doesn't want to give you a thick phone with a big
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   battery.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.040]   You mean like this?
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.040]   Yeah, they want to optimize for a thinner...
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.040]   It's just a thick phone with such a big battery.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040]   Yeah, I know.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.760]   It's sickening to even look at it.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   So thick.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   So I...
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.760]   What do you get?
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760]   Absolutely gets...
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   I get all day.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.760]   Until I go to bed that night.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.560]   Yeah, well I usually do too.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.880]   I think there are some quirks in iOS 7 too where apps can run in the background now,
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   truly run in the background.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.400]   And occasionally I will get a misbehaving app and that will lead to trouble.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.400]   That'll kill you.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.400]   But that happens everywhere.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.200]   But Apple obviously is going to solve for what it thinks is the right amount of battery
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.360]   and no more because they don't want to make it any bigger or any heavier.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.160]   Okay, so good enough, not great.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.880]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.400]   Somebody's connecting me with a specialist.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400]   I didn't think anything but I'm...
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.920]   Let's start chatting and talking to...
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.920]   Hey, Gentina Maria.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.400]   You're going to say start chat.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.400]   I don't know, really?
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.400]   Say hi.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   Okay, we're on Mac Pro.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.320]   Don't tell her why.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.520]   I have to tell her on Mac break.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:10.040]   Hey, when will the new Mac Pro ship...
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.040]   How can I assist you?
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.800]   When will the new Mac Pro ship?
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.120]   Let's see what Gentina Maria says.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.840]   This is probably an invasion of privacy.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.880]   Except she's not an audio person, right?
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   Maybe.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   Maybe she is.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880]   Probably not our last name though.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.240]   Oh, when you go to 703, you get the hola hello.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:29.320]   Al Fiederzain Bongjour thing.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.720]   I got to start it over.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:31.720]   Jumbo.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.720]   What's up with that?
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:33.720]   That was really nice.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.720]   Yeah, right before the show.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.880]   And I don't know my iCloud ID.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.440]   So you get to the point where you have to put your iCloud ID in.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.440]   I can't get to one...
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.840]   This is a point update.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.840]   They shouldn't be a complete...
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.920]   Any time they change iCloud, they make you sign back into it.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.080]   So this added the iCloud keychain stuff.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.560]   So you've got to sign back into iCloud.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.800]   You've got to sign back into your Wi-Fi network.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.720]   I mean, it's weird.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.640]   I'll update the OTAIR updates now.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.400]   Choose a Wi-Fi network.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.400]   Yeah, doomed.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   You've got to put in your password.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:03.120]   I got to choose the FBI surveillance fan again.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.120]   I really do want it.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.360]   Oh, see, it knows it though.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360]   So I'm just going to choose it.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.360]   Oops.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.160]   It has a check mark.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.200]   Oh no, it does want the password.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200]   Why does it?
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.200]   Because it's the iCloud update.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.400]   Because it didn't do it for 702, didn't it?
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.400]   No.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:23.280]   And we'll only ask your password if it's not restoring an encrypted backup, which unfortunately
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.520]   the iCloud ones aren't yet.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.880]   It's not in the question mark.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.240]   It's an exclamation mark.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.240]   Incorrect.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.240]   Oh, God.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.240]   What does she say?
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.640]   I will be more than happy to answer your questions about shipping.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.640]   Cool.
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:39.640]   When?
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.640]   When?
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   Will.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.640]   It's ships.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.080]   It's ships.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.240]   This is a bot.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.200]   Otherwise it wouldn't say that, right?
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.520]   A human would say that.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.680]   A human would say, oh, yeah, well, I can't tell you or something.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.920]   It wouldn't say I'll be more than happy to answer that question.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.920]   It'll say December.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.840]   Didn't you watch the keynote?
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.320]   I think I'm talking with a bot.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.240]   Or someone following a very specific instructions.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.440]   Do you think she's pasting it in?
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440]   It's got a flow chart.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.440]   Yeah, she's searching through her intro.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:17.440]   I don't know.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.680]   Why did he ask me that?
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.960]   Is this store help or Mac help?
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.720]   I don't even know where how I got here.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.280]   It's apple.com.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.640]   Or is it?
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.200]   It just happened.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.640]   They're fishing for Leo's.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:36.120]   I did buy the MacBook Pro with Retina 15-inch.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:40.400]   You start asking her non-tech orders like, what is the temperature in Zimbabwe?
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400]   What is it like where you are?
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.280]   What's the color of the sky in your world?
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.840]   She's really thinking.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:54.120]   She's like, she's asking for a manager right now.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.680]   Oh, dot, dot, dot.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.360]   I'm checking the info here in our Apple Online store.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.320]   Well, I could do that.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.080]   You should tell her that.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.040]   Please allow me just a few more moments.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.600]   No, you should respond.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.600]   I found it.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.600]   It's December.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600]   Yeah, I just found it.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.600]   Never mind.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.760]   I'm feeling terrible now.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:16.920]   I would be terrible on one of those prank shows, you know.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.680]   I feel guilty.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.840]   Dot, dot.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.440]   We totally buried the lead, Leo.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.760]   Not only is there no touch ID on the iPads, there's no gold option.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760]   Shock, there's no gold.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.760]   Oh, are you really?
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:34.560]   Do you really think that Apple's going to have some gold up like a big huge tablet of
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.560]   the whole?
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560]   It's opulence.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560]   We think they like opulence.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560]   Opulence, I have to say.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:43.840]   The only person who would actually be using one of these solid, one of these big gold
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:47.760]   iPads is the sort of person who wants to walk around with like pointy shoes with tassels
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:48.760]   hanging off the phone.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   But here's the thing.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.840]   Here's the only thing about that is that we made a lot of fun of the gold iPhone on
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.160]   this show.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.320]   And it is the only one I've seen in the wild.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.280]   Like literally the only iPhone 5S that I've seen in the wild is the champagne one.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.280]   The only acceptable option, Alex.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.800]   I understand that you have only one.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.800]   I don't have one yet.
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:08.800]   I've been busy.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.800]   Opulence, I have it.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.800]   Yeah, it has it.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.800]   Oh, you're okay.
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.800]   There you go.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.600]   It's not that gold.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.280]   That's one of the reasons.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   It's just not that gold.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.280]   It's gorgeous.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.280]   You know, it's beautiful.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.440]   It's precious to you.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.440]   Opulence.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.800]   Now you just need one of those little dinosaurs.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.200]   They're precious.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.480]   And I do like the fingerprint reader.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.480]   I'm a little...
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.480]   Okay, now here we go.
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:33.640]   Set up iCloud keychain.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.640]   iCloud keychain.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   This is new.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.400]   It's a password and credit card information you save up to date on the devices you approve.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.320]   Information is encrypted and cannot be read by Apple.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.680]   Let's press the setup.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.560]   Your security code can be used to set up the keychain on a new device.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.160]   Use passcode.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.960]   So now it wants my phone number.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:56.520]   I'm not sure why.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.520]   It should have that.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.520]   It's your phone.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.920]   It's the same phone I'm using.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.920]   Thank you.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.560]   And our phone number...
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.880]   Oh, it's going to send me a text message.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.700]   Now it's saying welcome to iPhone.
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.800]   Get started.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.440]   Well that was a very odd experience.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.440]   I'm not sure.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.920]   Maybe it's going to send me a text message later.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.640]   I was thinking about it.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.640]   Working.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   I do.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.200]   I do wish they'd had the touch ID.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.800]   Why do we think they didn't do touch ID in the new iPads?
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.640]   I think they want to figure it out.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.640]   Like you're like, why?
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:27.640]   It's too early.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.640]   It's going to be like a couple of weeks.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:30.480]   Like, let the five-ass do its thing for...
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.040]   And the next version has it really...
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.040]   You know, they'll knock...
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.640]   I have a whole bunch of people have bugs rather than just the folks with the five-ass.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   Also don't they want to keep that component for the pro?
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:43.400]   For the huge something, you sure?
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.400]   They sell so many more iPhones than they do iPads.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.960]   And if they want to have a bottleneck, don't they want to make sure that they're not causing
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:54.000]   the bottleneck or they're not coming through it's there?
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   Because of the iPad.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.280]   That's the only thing I could think of too is if they just can't make enough sense.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.440]   I'm sure they'd like to.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.040]   And Sarah Lane pointed out, once you use the iPhone 5s and you get used to it, you really
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.960]   don't want to type in your ideas.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:06.960]   It's just a pain.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.520]   It's more of a pain in a butt.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.440]   Oh, hey, Mavericks.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.080]   To set up Mavericks, click Continue.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   You're so adventurous.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.880]   Oh, this is so exciting.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.320]   I've got two updates.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.160]   And one day I'm feeling very updated.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.160]   Updated.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.160]   Updated.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.160]   Did you read that?
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.160]   I forgot to read it.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.680]   Christmas and your birthday all wrapped together, Leo.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.720]   Are we recommending that people do this?
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.120]   What I'm doing now, which is installing in place?
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.960]   Maybe not while they're on a show, but oh, come on.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.560]   It's just never stopped Leo before.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.000]   Never stopped me before preparing to install your computer will restart automatically in
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   eight seconds.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   Please check with the chat.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.480]   The chat person said the chat.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   Oh, I forgot the chat person.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.480]   Oh, no.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.400]   Oh, are you still there?
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   Not till December.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   Great.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.400]   Thanks.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   Gotta go.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.040]   Gotta go.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.040]   Up.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.680]   Oh, I am.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.000]   Upgrading to Mavericks.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.560]   To Mavericks.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:05.120]   And by by Gentina Maria.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.760]   You're swinging for you now.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760]   Okay.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760]   Now Mavericks wants me.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760]   Click restart.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.760]   Okay.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   Close other applications.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.760]   Yes, that's fine.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.600]   Bye, chat room.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.600]   Wow.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:21.960]   Is this multitasking or what?
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.440]   Who's the first person who's going to create like a TMZ dot com?
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.440]   That's for Apple.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.880]   That's just as, you know, that's a great idea.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   Go for it.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.960]   I think we have several.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.480]   I'm not sure if I would pay any money for the first Phil Schiller upscirt shot.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.480]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.800]   If he wants to get out of a limo, I'm not looking.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.440]   There's proof.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.760]   I've known it all along.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:50.160]   Mike Elgin writing for the Cult of Max says, yes, Apple does maintain a press blacklist,
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.760]   a people in the media who are shunned and ignored for disloyalty.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.200]   Blacklisted reporters, editorialists and media personalities are denied access to information,
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200]   products and events.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.400]   And once you're on the list says, Mike, it's almost impossible to get off.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.520]   He says he's been on it for more than a decade.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.680]   I've only been on it for three years.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.280]   So that's not bad.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.640]   I don't know that I'm on the list, but that's what I was wondering reading that is how does
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.840]   Mike know he's on that list and how does he know there is a list?
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.840]   We got an article.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840]   He wrote the article that makes it.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.840]   Oh, he wrote the book.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:23.840]   Self-fulfilling.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.840]   We've heard lots of-
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:25.840]   But I mean, we've heard-
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:31.440]   He said right there using a Windows phone and I think Andy still has access, right?
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.600]   I, yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.920]   I read the whole article.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.840]   I mean, it really, I really think that that's being blown out of proportion.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.960]   I'm sure that every company, whenever they have a new product or new thing that they
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.400]   want to get coverage on, they have an idea inside their heads of who they absolutely
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.600]   want to work with.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.920]   I'm sure there's one or two that-
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.680]   And this is true for every single company of who they maybe are now inclined to work
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.440]   with again.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:07.080]   I think mostly it comes down to easy to track metrics like what is this person's audience?
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.440]   Is it a localized audience?
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.000]   Is it an international audience?
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.240]   What kind of coverage have they written in the past?
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.640]   Is this person a bozo?
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.120]   Is this person absolutely not get us and on the best day of our lives?
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.640]   Will the best thing we ever make?
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.160]   Will they get anything that we do?
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.200]   I just don't think that-
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:33.000]   I don't think that any company feels as though they can control an individual writer by controlling
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.360]   access to the company.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.680]   I think the one thing that you can do above everything else is to simply be a professional.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.680]   I've-
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.400]   Last year, I've wrote a couple of things about Apple that I'm sure they weren't very happy
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.400]   with.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.200]   My relationship with the people I know at Apple remained exactly the same.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.600]   As usual, at times I'm invited to stuff and times I'm not invited to stuff.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.280]   At times I get stuff early, sometimes I don't.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.560]   If I let that affect in any way, shape, or form how I do my job, I wouldn't be doing
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.560]   my job.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.560]   So that's why-
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.560]   You're a vertical surfer.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:04.560]   I think that's what I think-
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.560]   I think that-
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.560]   I think that-
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560]   Thank you very much.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.320]   They're well thought out and fact based and I think that stands on its own.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.320]   Thank you.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.920]   I mean, that's really the point.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.640]   I mean, if you're a professional, you'll get the job done no matter what help you get,
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.200]   what help you don't get.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.240]   And I just don't think that it's in any way productive to try to work out that, "Oh,
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.240]   well, there's a blacklist and I'm on it in the larger than any one individual who
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.000]   think, "Oh, well, I'm on the blacklist.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.240]   That's why I'm not getting my emails responded to."
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.840]   Or someone else saying, "Well, geez, I don't know why I'm not getting my emails responded
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:37.840]   to.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.320]   I write nothing but good things about Apple."
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.320]   Again.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:46.880]   The thing is, until any company decides to say, "Here's the list of everybody that
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.080]   we like and everybody that we don't like and all the reasons why we are going to help
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.000]   some people and why we're not going to help some other people, all you're doing is engaging
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.440]   in conjecture."
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.080]   And that's just absolutely pointless.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.960]   I'm sure a lot of PR people feel the same way about us.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.440]   I mean, I get hundreds, if not thousands of PR emails a week and I don't have the opportunity
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.440]   to answer half of them.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.440]   I don't exactly-
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.440]   And I'm sure they think there's a list.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440]   Yeah, I'm sure they think that there's-
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.440]   They're all on my list.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.440]   I agree with Andy.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.440]   I don't, whether there's a blacklist or not.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.560]   And Mike doesn't effectively prove that there is a blacklist, although I would imagine there's.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:23.240]   It shouldn't affect anybody's willingness to do their job pro or con.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.680]   And it certainly doesn't affect mine.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:31.720]   And whether you have- I mean, his point is well taken that, for instance, he presumes,
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:37.200]   doesn't prove that when the New York Times ran those stories arguably hit pieces on Apple
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:42.960]   about the factories, Apple gave a big scoop to the Wall Street Journal very shortly after
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.040]   and gave him Tim Cook.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.480]   Can I have to admit, if I was running a company on someone-
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480]   You know, do that.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480]   Don't have to do that.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.480]   Say, "Thank you for the fact that you're not-"
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.480]   It's-
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.440]   But if you, for instance, if you give product review loners to people who you know will
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.960]   be positive and you will be-
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.960]   Well, why would you?
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:00.960]   ...fued people-
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960]   Yeah, I mean-
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.960]   No, no, no, no, no, you should-
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.960]   Of course, you could.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.960]   Of course, you could.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:05.960]   As a company that-
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.960]   Of course, you could and can.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.440]   But the point of view of the public should be-
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.440]   Right.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.680]   ...then suspicious of coverage of that company.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:14.680]   For instance, and I'll-
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:16.080]   We'll take it out of the tech realm.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.280]   It's very well known that Beltway Journalism has its risks because your sources are the
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.880]   members of Congress that you're covering and they can ice you, giving you no access,
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.680]   making it very difficult to do your job as a reporter inside Washington's Beltway.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:33.040]   So it's a very careful balancing act as a reporter that you have to do.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:34.040]   No, that's-
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:35.040]   And I'll-
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:40.720]   ...one blacklist, which is John C. Devorak, there was maintained at Microsoft for many
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.080]   years, an enemies list.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.800]   It was like a Nick Sonian enemies list, and John happened to walk by the office and see
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.400]   it, and he saw his name on it, and it's an enemy.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.800]   He was probably really happy about that.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.800]   While he was in the building.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.800]   He was in the building.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.680]   So, and it never really hurt him in terms of his ability to do his job.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.080]   The folks still got review units, he still got his devices and-
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.280]   If you're powerful enough, you will get review units.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.640]   Yeah, and the thing is that-
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:08.640]   ...the tears-
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:15.200]   I mean, I was a worked in PR for Sony Music a long time ago, and my job was to get press,
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.800]   you know, for bands, for living color, or Indigo Girls, or whatever.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.840]   And you're not going to get access to people who don't.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.080]   Well, I mean, the thing is, so the-
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.200]   ...we would, you know, shower on the guys.
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.720]   You know, I took my job with the tech guys out drinking.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:28.200]   You know, and the tech-
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.760]   ...you know, make sure that they got to see the bands and make sure they got backstage
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.760]   and make sure-
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.760]   ...you know, they did all those things.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.760]   And they didn't put my guys in hot rotation.
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.960]   And, you know, I'd put up with that for a couple times.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.720]   Then after that, they're not getting backstage, and they're not getting, you know, pre-releases,
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.920]   they're not getting giveaways, and not getting-
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:41.720]   You know, like, I'm not going to-
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.760]   ...you know, I have a whole bunch of people I got to take care of, and I'm not going to take care of-
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.440]   ...it's no accident, for instance, that Gizmodo has never been in an Apple event after the-
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.440]   ...yes.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.440]   ...they bought that stolen iPhone.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.440]   That's no secret.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.000]   Or that Leo's not been in a event after he-
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.480]   I don't know, you know, I truthfully-
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.840]   ...I have no idea whether I'm on a list or not, and I know-
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.000]   ...it doesn't really matter to me.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.200]   I probably wouldn't- You could just like joke it about it.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:07.720]   But speaking to Apple, the only way that you can prove that there is no black list is for
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.720]   Leo to be at the next Apple event.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:14.240]   Well, I- There was a time when I was invited to every event, and they sent me little Christmas
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.240]   packages- No.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:19.280]   ...which I felt ethically very challenged by, wrapped with ribbon and all the new iPods
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.280]   in it.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:24.440]   There was a time when I was on somebody's good side.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.360]   But I stopped taking loaners a long time ago, for the most part, by everything I needed.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.640]   And I can afford to do that.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.960]   I do feel sorry for a working journalist who cannot afford to do that, who's trying to
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:37.160]   cover Apple and doesn't get any support.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.440]   But that- I think you sort of hit upon it.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:46.040]   I think when the complaint that some people will have is that when you really peel the
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:51.560]   onion and get to the very core of it, it's that company X did not send me a free one
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:55.960]   of these for 30 days, and they did not send it to me early.
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:59.640]   Neither of these things will prevent you from writing about that product.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.240]   It's not the end of the world.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:04.960]   If you don't have it on- If they didn't send you one, then you have it available on release
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.600]   day, you're perfectly welcome to go buy one on your own.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:10.960]   If you can't buy one on your own, you probably know somebody who has access to one.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:14.600]   And if you don't have that, there are ways to get your hands on one that don't involve
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:15.600]   theft.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:21.000]   The only thing that I don't- The only thing I really don't like about these sort of conversations
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.640]   is that it comes down to a sense of entitlements that, "Hey, look, I have a big audience.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.840]   I should be getting a certain amount of treatment."
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.720]   Or, "Hey, you don't know who I am.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:32.240]   You should be helping me out as much as you possibly can."
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:36.680]   You know, unfortunately, and this is a problem I have, any time I talk about it, that's what
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.680]   it ends up sounding like.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.680]   I'm being peevish.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:39.680]   I know.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680]   I know.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.680]   I don't mean to be peevish.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.880]   In fact, Mike says clearly, at the end of his article at the call to Mac, the technology
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:50.080]   presses far more independent and ethical than people generally give them credit for.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.800]   Yes, Apple has a blacklist.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.000]   And yes, you should know about it so you can be a better informed media consumer and consumer
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.280]   electronics customer, but ultimately, it's not that big of a deal.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:00.920]   So he really agrees with what you're saying.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.800]   There is a lot of freedom in non-being stuff.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.800]   I love it.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   I don't talk to PR people.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.880]   I don't go to company events.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.920]   I don't take vendor meetings because in the long run, it's better for me and my coverage
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.120]   not to have a relationship with companies.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.120]   And so-
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:14.120]   I think I'll go ahead.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   It's not for me.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:20.000]   I mean, I really enjoy having a dialogue with the company that makes these things because
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.480]   sometimes only when you're sitting in a room with somebody and they are explaining to
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.080]   you why they built this thing, why they think this is important, why they went ahead with
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.080]   this product.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.400]   And especially if you're there in the room and you get to really look into their eyes
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:37.680]   and see, am I the 11th person that is going that is being read the script that they came
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   up with?
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.080]   Or if I ask them questions that make them go off script, am I going to see the exact same
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.280]   amount of childlike pleasure?
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.440]   I mean, the APEX has always been for me.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.480]   Steve Jobs resending the iPhone and Steve Jobs is friend of the iPad.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.480]   You saw a guy who was like giddy with excitement.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.200]   Like he was unwrapping a gift for the entire world.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:05.120]   And so I don't necessarily believe that it's important to maintain a distance because
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:11.840]   sometimes I will look at a product without benefit of the story around it and not get
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.520]   why someone was making this.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.720]   And it's not as though my opinions will be changed by hearing the engineers who came
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.600]   up with this certain feature or lobby for this or that.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.920]   But it's sometimes interesting to hear that backstory because that's a perspective that
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920]   you don't have.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.960]   So that's it's it's it's it's more logical Andy than then picturing them actually spending
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.960]   energy.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.960]   You know, oh, let's put this guy in the list.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.360]   You know, we keep the list.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.160]   Yeah, I just can't I just can't picture a corporation like Apple doing that.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.960]   I can I can picture a media.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:42.960]   Oh, I can't.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:48.000]   You can also absolutely you have you they are come look they're humans.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.560]   They can be petty.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560]   Absolutely.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.200]   They just okay.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.480]   I just I disagree.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:57.960]   I I really do think that it comes down to every every single time I think it comes down
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:03.520]   to how many if we've got if we've got eight copies of the new iPhone that we can give
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.520]   to people ahead of time.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.840]   Those are those are precious commodities.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840]   What are it's not?
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:12.920]   Who do we like or who do we not like it's what are our goals with these eight and only
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:20.000]   I talk to more people about Macintosh products than anybody except for the rare few I do
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.520]   a radio show that's heard by a million people every weekend.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.640]   I do Mac break weekly and if Apple doesn't invite me to the event, it's not because I
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.880]   don't have a large and important pulpit.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.040]   It's because they don't like me.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.040]   It's very simple.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.120]   I'm not I don't mean to be peevish about it.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.120]   I'm not I don't care.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.120]   I don't I don't care.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.640]   I don't I definitely a list and I'm on it if they weren't why wouldn't they invite me.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:42.680]   I don't think it comes down to like or not like I think it comes down to like.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:44.440]   It comes down to goals.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.440]   That's all.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:46.440]   Come on.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.440]   I talk to Andy.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.040]   We I have a syndicated radio show that talks to 200 stations talks to a million people
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.440]   every weekend about what products to buy and you think that that's not important Apple
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:59.080]   more than USA and a more than Wall Street Journal more than New York Times.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:03.080]   It should be if it's not there it's then they're not paying attention.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.720]   The argument that I'm making is with the word like you know, Apple is a company.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.200]   They are 10,000 people.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.200]   They.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:20.040]   No, no, I'm merely saying that the reasonable business decision would be to curry favor with
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.520]   me, which they don't do.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.960]   And my suggestion is they don't do it.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:23.960]   That's fine with me.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:24.960]   By the way, I wouldn't take it.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.960]   But it's fine with me.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:29.600]   But the reasonable reason is that you know, there was a very much of a cliff where I went
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.120]   from being favored to unfavored.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:33.440]   I'm it was obvious to me.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.440]   I don't care about that.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:38.520]   I don't want to go to their events, but but but the point is I'm pointing out it's there's
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.440]   no question in my mind.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.880]   It's obvious.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.920]   And it's not because of whether I talk to people or not, or whether I have an importance
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:46.920]   to their business.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:51.360]   A prudent business decision would be to curry favor with one of the major mainstream tech
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.800]   reporters in the country.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.800]   Period.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.800]   Right.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.440]   They don't do John C. de Vorac either.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:01.880]   Again, all my only difficulties with like or not like or whether they have the.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.280]   I'm not saying they don't like me.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.280]   I don't know what they like.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.280]   I mean, I can't tell you that.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:09.920]   I'm saying I have no knowledge of the inner desires or workings of Apple.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.400]   I'm also saying that it's also not important to you or I that we know with their inner
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   side.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.400]   It's not important at all.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.400]   I get my same coverage.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:17.400]   Exactly.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:18.400]   Because well, yeah, it's not only.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.440]   But you can't tell me John Gruber has this much importance to Apple in the in the public
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]   eye.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.640]   I will I will tell you I know I people have asked me about this.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:28.920]   I've given them the exact same answer.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.560]   The reason why they work so closely with Gruber is huge audience, not only that, but
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.560]   a huge international.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560]   I'm much bigger.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.560]   I'm 10 times the audience.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.560]   You're not kidding me.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:39.560]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.560]   Yes, yes.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.560]   Yes, yes.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.560]   Specialist audience.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.240]   He has he has credibility and also he he gets Apple and that that doesn't mean that
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.640]   if you don't get Apple, you're wrong.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.200]   I'm saying that gets his thinking.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.200]   His thinking.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.120]   I'm saying I believe that his way of thinking about what is the role of design?
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.320]   What is the role of hardware?
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:59.760]   What is the interaction between a company and its customers and a product and its customers
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.680]   are very much in sync with Apple.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:06.160]   So when Apple when people inside Apple read his stuff, they hear they hear a kindred
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.520]   spirit speaking and they know he's not going to go off.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:09.520]   The ranch.
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.520]   He's going to be predictable.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.520]   No, I know.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.480]   I think that again, I don't know of any of any thinking inside of Apple, but my guess
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:21.160]   would be that they know that if he went off the ranch would be because he felt very very
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.880]   he felt very deliberately about it.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.280]   He would also he wouldn't do it accidentally.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.560]   He wouldn't do it carelessly and he would express his sentiments very, very closely.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:30.560]   That's all.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:36.560]   So all I'm saying is that what every single person who is not a bozo wants is for their
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.040]   own work to tell the story of what kind of professional they are.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.320]   And I think that if you that's I think that readers readers are very, very good at telling
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.320]   that this person.
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:50.080]   Gee, this person got a piece of hardware and he wrote a thousand words on this piece of
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.320]   hardware and 800 words of it where how cool it was to get hardware from Apple.
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:56.320]   This guy is a bozo.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.640]   I don't care what he's saying.
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.640]   Also from the flip side, if you write, you know, 2000 words on a certain laptop and you're
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.520]   saying that this is this is I won't I won't identify the the columnist.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:11.280]   It wasn't me, but it was like it's still like the hallmark of bad tech reporting for me
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.280]   that.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:16.320]   Oh, here's the here's the new titanium Mac, the power book, but it's it's okay.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.080]   But you should buy it because Apple's gonna go out of business.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.080]   It's like a thousand word review.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.720]   You spent 800 words talking about what you think is the death of the company.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.800]   Again, that's bozo behavior view.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:29.440]   If you build up your own reputation, everything that this the ship will write itself, you
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.960]   will get safely into the port of your compsies.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:32.960]   That's great.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.960]   Nobody say that.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.280]   We're not even discussing that.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:36.280]   That's not even the issue.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.360]   Is does Apple try to manipulate the press with a blacklist?
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.880]   I don't think so.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:41.880]   Okay.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:45.280]   I think that if they thought that they can manipulate this person, that they know that
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.680]   this person is of little value to them.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.800]   They don't want they don't just want somebody to.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:59.000]   Oh, I'm really you think the presence of little value to them if they know that they
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.920]   can get a good story at them.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:01.920]   What's valuable?
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:02.920]   Okay.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:03.920]   It's easy.
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:05.080]   I'm saying it's very, very easy to get a story.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:09.320]   But again, if I if you walked into the Apple store, found somebody who knows how to operate
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:12.040]   Tumblr, say, I'll give you this free MacBook Air.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.560]   If you write something about it, they'll get a lot of good press about it.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:17.760]   They'll get a lot of good Tumblr posts about it.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:22.840]   What they want is again, somebody with a large audience, someone with a reputation so that
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:28.040]   when that person decides to use that reputation as a spotlight to swing it to this product
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:33.320]   to say, I want all of you people who read me or listen to me or watch me to take a look
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.880]   at this because I think it's important enough that you look at this because I'm interested
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.360]   in it as well.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:39.360]   That's what the value is.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.600]   They're very, very few.
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:44.960]   They're very few high value people like that who can be manipulated because by the time
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:49.080]   you've developed that kind of a reputation, you're kind of you're no longer dazzled by
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:54.280]   the idea, oh, well, I got a I got a bar a bar a free free Nexus 5 for two weeks.
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:55.760]   This is awesome.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.000]   You know, that's that's what I that's what I mean when I'm saying that Apple wants a high
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.520]   value person to speak highly of their products.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.120]   And those people are not the sort of people who are going to be swayed by the idea of
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.120]   getting something early.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.520]   Have you ever heard of a guy named Kevin Abos?
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.760]   He's a Hollywood photographer.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.760]   If you go to his website, you'll see portraits of Dennis Hopper, Scarlett Johansson, Johnny
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:21.080]   Depp, Dustin Hoffman, great photographer.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:25.000]   He also has a good friend, a friend named Tony Fadel.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.600]   And apparently Tony came over the other day to Kevin's house with his newest acquisition
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:38.520]   up Tony Fadel, of course, of Nest, former iPod designer seems to have bought some solid
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:46.840]   gold earbuds and it was a friend of his was it a friend or was it Tony the bottom?
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:47.840]   He denied it.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:53.640]   It was him and then Tony Fadel with a Red Mac Pro.
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.720]   And apparently he's already trying to hack it.
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.320]   So that answers one question.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.360]   They did deliver the Red Mac Pro right away.
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:02.360]   They didn't wait.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:07.160]   You saying if he's trying to hack it, but it's not his, I think it's his.
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:09.040]   Yeah, no, he put out a statement.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.360]   He said that trying to find it.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:15.800]   He said that he was not the owner, but he had access to them.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:18.200]   I fix it, sent out a request.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:19.200]   That's clear.
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.200]   I'm not the owner of either.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.800]   The real owner will reveal themselves if they so choose.
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:23.800]   I fix it.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:24.800]   Can we do a tear down?
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.040]   We'll give it right back.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:27.640]   It'll be in the same, you know, in this.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:28.640]   Exactly.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.080]   And you'll have a manual on how to do it yourself.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.040]   Just think of how many people are going to watch it before it's even been released.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.440]   I fix it.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.440]   Come on.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.040]   Call Tony.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.440]   So Tony said it's not mine.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.480]   It's a friend of mine.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.480]   Who would that be?
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.800]   He was not going to reveal.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:44.480]   He said it's up to his friend to reveal who it is.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:46.320]   Well, he shoots for a lot of actors.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.640]   So it would be it could be a Bosch does.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:49.640]   A Bosch does.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.720]   Could be a friend of Tonys and Aboshes, right?
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.720]   Like Johnny Depp.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.000]   It could be Johnny Depp's new iMac.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.040]   To be clear, I'm not the owner of either the real owner will reveal themselves if
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:02.040]   they so choose.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.280]   I don't know if I buy that.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:12.760]   You did have to say that in the first picture, it looks like every medieval panel of Mary
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:15.720]   and the newborn Jesus in the future.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:21.680]   Come let us adore the rose-colored first one, the first one with the earbuds.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:22.680]   Oh, the earbuds?
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.520]   Oh, come let us adore him.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.920]   In extra sea stay.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.680]   It does, doesn't it?
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.200]   Just like Photoshop a manger around those earbuds.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.960]   Unto us a child has been born.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.880]   We're waiting for it for those of you who are waiting for that picture to be sent to
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:39.880]   Twitter.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:40.880]   Wow, during the show.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.880]   He is gazing upon it.
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.880]   Now let's get a new one.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.560]   I mean, Tony's a guy designed the iPod.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.800]   So this would be kind of a big deal for him, right?
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.520]   I mean, rose gold, solid rose gold.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.800]   The earbuds designed by Johnny Ive.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:01.960]   Do you think Johnny I've bought it?
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:02.960]   No.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:04.880]   Yeah, Tony, I'm holding it for him.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.240]   I'm wondering if he did buy the table.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.400]   I wonder if he bought something off of that list.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.960]   There must have been something that was so cool that, I don't know, especially if he
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.320]   could have it and be tax deductible.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:23.640]   I love the picture Kevin took of himself in the reflection of the red Mac Pro.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:25.320]   That's a nice picture too.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.320]   That's instant lock screen.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:31.480]   Oh, Lee, I wonder who.
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:32.480]   Okay.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:37.240]   I mean, you should be able to try if you don't fear the NSA, we could tell with the metadata
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:40.280]   that we already have who it was.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.280]   Who's in the reflection?
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:42.280]   I bet you he's got it.
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.280]   Because there's, you know what?
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.280]   Let's get somebody.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.280]   Okay.
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:48.080]   What do they do in Blade Runner zoom center?
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:49.760]   Rotate a little more.
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:50.760]   Zoom in.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:57.400]   Because there's somebody in that reflection, I swear to God, there's a, I see a camera,
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:58.840]   but who's this person?
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:02.320]   I'm telling you, I want you guys to get to work on this.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.480]   There's something in here.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:06.440]   Could be John Rubenstein.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.440]   Who would it be?
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.440]   Who has that kind of money?
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.320]   What this sold for almost a million dollars?
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:14.240]   The two together like a million a quarter.
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.760]   That's a lot of money to throw away on in a home theater piece.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.760]   John's estate.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:19.560]   Do you think it's Lorraine?
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.560]   Okay.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:26.880]   Now, I know to alpha team who's now Photoshopping the major scene, I want to now create Bravo
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:31.120]   team to their companies that will create that will like shrink wrap things like they
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.760]   shrink wrap cars.
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:36.480]   When you get, get them when you get a Mac Pro, get one of these companies to shrink wrap
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.720]   in red, take it down to a genius bar just for routine service and see if they say anything.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:46.520]   Can you imagine the guy coming into the genius bar with the red back pro?
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.480]   He gets it home.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:49.480]   It's a blackboard.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.360]   Oh, well, you had a bad launch report.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.800]   We just swapped you out of free one.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.080]   We know that's out of warranty, but hey, we're awesome.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.560]   It's had after marketing.
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.120]   We're sorry.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.400]   We managed to scrape off the paint job that some loser put it on.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.400]   Why God?
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.160]   Anyone goes to Home Depot and gets a can of spray paint.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.440]   They think they know more than Johnny I have about how these things should look.
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.440]   It's like they're welcome.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:12.000]   They call it correct at the green girl.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.360]   I have a theory.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:15.760]   I'm going to do some digging.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:18.760]   I think we could triangulate this.
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:24.400]   If this was a cop show in 1983 when computers were starting to become very popular, they
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.600]   would solve this about eight seconds.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.600]   I'm telling you, zoom in on that.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.240]   I've been a friend at JPL.
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.240]   All right.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240]   I'm going to do some.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.240]   All right.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:34.240]   Let's let's getting nervous.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.080]   Is it Alex's picture in the map pro?
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:38.080]   I thought he's averting his gaze.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.840]   He really is not listening to you.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:41.840]   It's like no way.
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:44.160]   The thing was though, that didn't turn you for now actually take it along.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.200]   It must be a really, really close friend of hers if it's not his too.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:51.040]   I think you sure take my million dollar of Mac Pro and the solid gold earbuds and go
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.360]   and show them to your friend.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360]   Well, no.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.440]   Here's what happened.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:58.040]   It's going to be a friend of the two of them, right?
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:03.040]   Because the guy came over to A. Bosch's house, brought his new toys.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.360]   Tony Fidell came over and they were playing with it.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:06.840]   They took pictures.
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:09.440]   The guy said, don't take a picture of me.
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:11.920]   So it means it's somebody we'd recognize.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:14.880]   I'm going to vote for John Lasseter.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.880]   Maybe.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:18.160]   That would be my guess.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.160]   Interesting.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:22.520]   It's going to be a Hollywood type.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:27.560]   But somebody who has an appreciation of Macintosh, you know, Pixar, of course, they render stuff
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.560]   like crazy.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.560]   I'm going to--
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.440]   It's not me because I don't want that rumor to take hold.
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:32.440]   It's definitely not me.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:36.280]   I don't know how these rumors get started except for on shows like this.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.760]   So don't start telling people that I'm the guy who--
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:42.800]   That is definitely not in the basement.
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.680]   I think we need to track the back.
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:47.680]   Who is Kevin A. Bosch friends with?
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.680]   It's definitely not me.
[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:50.920]   R2D2 housing over back there.
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:51.920]   Mm.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:56.320]   It is, by the way, we should point out text deductible because for charity.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.320]   Just in case.
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:00.320]   Also, the Apple Carries--
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.080]   You think it has matching tags coming out of their bank account.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:07.160]   And it's going to be somebody who has a love for Apple and a love for Macintosh, right?
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:09.800]   Otherwise, you'd have bought the Leica.
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:10.800]   I don't know.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:16.640]   It could have been just-- there are probably four or five really high profile cool things
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.640]   in that option.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:24.800]   In that option, called the earbuds, the Mac Pro, the Leica, the table, and I probably
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:25.800]   couldn't bump up the five.
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.720]   But there are four five that were really high profile, really cool.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.680]   Oh, it's fun to have friends with Photoshop skills.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:35.680]   How can we--
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:36.680]   I'll send that over to you.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:37.680]   Send me that image.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.680]   I beat you all.
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:44.200]   While we were talking, Alex Lindsay made a little picture first.
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.200]   He does.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.640]   He's gazing with wonder.
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.640]   And it's even gold.
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:49.640]   Did you see that?
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:51.640]   It took me a lot of time to find that one.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.400]   He got Rose gold, baby Jesus.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:55.560]   Is it Ashton Kutcher?
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.600]   He's not rich enough.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:58.600]   Is it Wozniak?
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.160]   He's not rich enough.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:01.160]   You know who's rich enough?
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.160]   John Laster, I'm telling you.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:03.160]   That's who it is.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:04.160]   They bought both of them, Leo.
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.160]   They couldn't just leave.
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:06.160]   You're not just one of them.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.160]   By both of them.
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:10.200]   Is he going to use his Mac Pro wearing the earbuds?
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:11.200]   You have to.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.360]   You've got to do that.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.360]   You've got to do that.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.720]   I mean, he should have the Mac Pro listen to the music through the earbuds on top of
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:23.720]   that aluminum table, wearing the space suit, and then take a picture of it with a Leica
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:30.560]   camera just to show that he is the captain of all the Easter days.
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:33.000]   It's got to be somebody who has a thing for Apple.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.120]   That's why Fidel is there.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.120]   Somebody in LA.
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.120]   Okay.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.120]   Did you send that via email?
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.120]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.120]   All right.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.400]   I will show you what Alex is doing for the last three minutes.
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:44.400]   You are good.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:45.400]   You are fast.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.960]   I don't know how you do that so fast.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:48.960]   You know.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.920]   It's got to be a photo show for a little while.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.920]   Have you?
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.440]   You know something about that?
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.480]   I can't remember when Photoshop didn't have layers.
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.480]   What?
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:01.480]   I remember when Photoshop didn't have colors.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.480]   Yeah, that was a big.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.480]   That was a big.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.480]   Oh my gosh.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.480]   We have layers.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.760]   I'm saving versions of this file over and over again.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:13.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Fidel and the second coming.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.920]   Oh, come let us.
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:17.920]   This is so sacrilegious.
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:20.200]   No, that's just a little baby.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.960]   Alex Lindsay, you win the $20 gift card to outback staycuffs.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.840]   Please contact me with your, with your mailing information.
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.320]   It is the right look though.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.320]   You nailed it.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.320]   Come let him adore him.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:33.320]   Absolutely.
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.320]   I have no son nor no goats.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:35.320]   Just know everywhere.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.680]   You might have goats that could be buried under the snow.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:41.720]   You hear an occasional muffled by and that's a lot of you.
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.360]   Yeah, spring comes and there's goats.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:50.800]   So it was a sound effect for when Andy was talking about beard and I didn't get it up
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:52.160]   into the sound system.
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:54.320]   I know I was going to show it to you and then have you play it.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:57.160]   It's a human voice screaming goats on YouTube.
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:00.080]   It all made sense before the show started.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:01.080]   I wasn't going to talk about it.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.080]   Is that it?
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:08.880]   Andy was talking about neighbors complaining about the sound.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:14.640]   Do not buy that goat, whatever that is.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:15.640]   What kind of goat is that?
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.720]   What are those kids doing down there?
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:18.720]   It's a lot of goats.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:22.920]   Oh, you know, unless you're trying to fabricate an ironclad alibi for something absolutely
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.240]   horribly planning for six weeks in the future.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.240]   It's the goats.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.240]   It's like there's a goat in my basement.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:32.440]   That was my thought of the sound of someone trying to pull all your facial hair.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:36.640]   You just didn't want to be like.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.320]   I know you were traveling when you were dancing.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:46.600]   You guys see the video?
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.400]   I don't know why.
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:04:01.760]   I don't know why.
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.600]   See, here's all I got to say is that we work hard on this show.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:06.600]   We work hard on this show.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:08.560]   How many years did we get on YouTube?
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.040]   Like, you know, thousands, you know, but two thousand three thousand.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.040]   Apparently there's fun.
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.040]   Jovi, there's a lot of people.
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:16.480]   You guys are like whoever's got the screaming goat just is sticking it everywhere.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:17.800]   And we're not even talking about the whole thing.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.520]   I knew you were a goat when you walked in.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.760]   I hope you've enjoyed this best of episode.
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:29.360]   Mac Break Weekly is back at our new time or old time chat.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:30.360]   Again, I don't remember.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.360]   We've got a new sketch this time.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:32.360]   At the same time.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:33.600]   So this will not change.

[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:37.760]   That is a 1 p.m.

[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.480]   1900 UTC every Tuesday.
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.560]   For the latest Mac news and analysis with Andy and Aco.
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:47.080]   Renee Richie in the gang.
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:48.600]   I think we had a great year.
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.600]   Thanks to you.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:51.440]   And I hope we'll have a wonderful 2014.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.920]   I hope you will too.
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:53.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.920]   We'll see you next time on Mac Break Weekly.
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:55.920]   Bye bye.
