[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 10 for October 10, 2006.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.880]   Look what they've done to my boy.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:51.360]   It's time for another Mac Break Weekly,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.640]   wherein our pundits gather once a week to talk
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.520]   about the latest Mac news.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.080]   Here today with us from the Pixel Core, Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.120]   Hello.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.320]   Who always does that?
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.120]   I don't know who it is or what he's doing, but I like it.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.160]   And Merlin Mann from 43folders.com.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.920]   Hello.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   Hello.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.600]   OK, who knows what Scott Born's going to come up
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   with from the iLife Zone?
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.000]   Scott Born.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.960]   Howdy, howdy, howdy.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080]   You got a bunch of-- got you cut-ups here.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.840]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680]   And this is the time to talk about Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.520]   I was saying to the guys just before we started,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.280]   what do we start with?
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.440]   And then I thought, well, it's obvious.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440]   The new Apple ads.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.400]   They were really good.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.680]   I love them, as always.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.240]   I love them.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.360]   You know what?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.200]   Here's the funny thing that I saw.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.240]   You don't see this on many ads, because most of the time,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.160]   we think of ads as an interruption.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.520]   But on CNET, they actually have these--
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.960]   they're running the Apple ads.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   And at the end of the ad, it has a click
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.520]   if you want to see the rest of the ads.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.720]   Of course, I did.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.560]   And I watched all the ones that I had missed.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.240]   People dig the new ads.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.680]   I mean, dig DIGG.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.160]   They say, oh, there's new ads out.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.720]   And people actually go to a website.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200]   That's a sign of an agency that's doing his job.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.640]   If you make an ad that everybody is actually going
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400]   on to the net to see.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   And that's what I think a lot of ad
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.640]   is you need to take notes.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.040]   Rather than trying to constantly force the ads on us,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.400]   make them something that we actually want to see.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.000]   And those aren't expensive ads.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I mean, the actor's like, you might have some expense.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.640]   But on the other than that, it's a lock off camera
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.760]   and a white psych.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.720]   So there's one that's--
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.680]   well, let me just play one of them, which I really like,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   which is the counselor.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.720]   Hello, I'm a man.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.400]   Can I'm a PC?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.600]   And I feel inadequate.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.080]   OK.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.320]   PCs get viruses.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.520]   We can't do as much out of the box.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.960]   I don't know why you're so hard on yourself.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.720]   I don't get it.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.400]   Mac, why don't you say something positive about PC?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   OK, easy.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.040]   PC, you are a wizard with numbers,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.520]   and you dress like a gentleman.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.040]   PC?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.600]   Well, Mac, I guess you are a little better at creative stuff.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   Thank you.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.840]   And even though it's completely juvenile and a waste of time.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.240]   Maybe you should come in twice a week.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.920]   I have to say, I think they're very funny.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.520]   Actually, if you want to parse what these mean--
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.680]   so this one is clearly about better creativity.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.160]   There's one on making home movies,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.760]   and there's one that actually has got the Mac
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.960]   dressed in a business suit.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.080]   And really, really sending the PC.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.600]   Oh, Mac.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.560]   And I'm a PC.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   I'll just play a little bit of that.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.800]   What's with the big boy, Clos?
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   Oh, this-- yeah, I just got back from a meeting.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.360]   So why are you at a meeting?
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.920]   Why do work stuff, too?
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   I've been running Microsoft Office for years.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.480]   Microsoft Office, work stuff.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.440]   Oh, boy.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.280]   Oh, I knew this day would come.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760]   PC, because I just need to sit down.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.200]   There's plenty of work out there for both of us.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   I don't know why you're acting like this.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.640]   Why go on?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.960]   Just let me lie here and depreciate.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.040]   That's my favorite line.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.240]   Just let me lie here and depreciate.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.840]   The actor who plays the PC is from the Daily Show, right?
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.880]   Oh, that is the very talented John Hodgman.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.240]   John Hodgman, yeah.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.840]   Really good.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.120]   I don't know who the Mac guy is.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.560]   Is he famous in any way?
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.480]   He was in Dodgeball.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.000]   I recognize him now.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.560]   Sure, yeah.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.040]   The kid.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.240]   So interesting, because all of these ads
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.320]   are kind of rank propaganda, no viruses,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.160]   all that stuff.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   But this last one, I thought, was kind of interesting,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.960]   because it's Apple saying, we do business, too.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   Do you think that signals a change for Apple in any way?
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.760]   Well, one of the things that I think is interesting is Apple,
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.560]   while these ads are really, really fun,
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.080]   they're also probably the hardest hitting Apple ads ever
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.560]   when it comes to just outright shaming people for using a PC.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.160]   I mean, what they're doing is create an environment of,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.960]   you know, it is, you're just not cool.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.560]   Is it preaching to the converted, though?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.160]   I mean, do these ads, they work with us as Mac aficionados?
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.960]   That's the thing is, I think of these almost more like Super Bowl ads.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.200]   I think these are spectacle ads.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.240]   I don't think they're there to persuade.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.200]   I think that they're there to get attention,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.520]   and they're very clever.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.760]   And it's funny.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.360]   I think they're, like I said, I think they're working kind
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.120]   of a Super Bowl angle, which is they want people
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.720]   to be reporting on these and digging these.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.280]   It's working.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.480]   We just played two of them.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.200]   That's right.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.520]   That's right.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.680]   But do you know what I'm saying, though?
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.480]   It isn't the typical sort of like, here's how you're going to get,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.280]   you know, 20% more clean with this soap.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's making a different kind of case straight to kind
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.360]   of a media savvy audience.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.800]   And yeah, I mean, I think it's working on that level.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.840]   If they can convince people that of all these facts, though,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.640]   or facts, or all these suppositions that the Apple's more creative,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.960]   and yes, it could do business too.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.600]   It's got Microsoft Office, blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.320]   Even those are important things to convince people of.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.640]   Do you think that people are looking at these?
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.680]   I think it's actually more aimed at the base to speak in political terms.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.440]   I think they just want to make sure they keep the base tied
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.800]   into what they already know.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.880]   And I don't think that they're going to convert tons of people myself.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   I think that they just keep everybody that's already a Mac person, a Mac person.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.200]   I think somebody who's been accused sometimes fairly of being a Mac partisan.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   I'm on my site.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.160]   I mean, in my experience, people don't like even clever remarks that insult them.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.600]   I mean, it's, you know what I mean?
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.520]   It's like, I guess I just don't see this being something
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.040]   where somebody who uses a PC who's heard all this on some level before,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.400]   I don't think they're suddenly going to just,
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.320]   I don't think this is going to be the ad that says,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.680]   "Oh, well, gosh, now they're ads are really clever,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.640]   so I'm going to go out and buy a Mac."
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.000]   Even if the facts are lined up.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.080]   Do you think you could backfire and actually piss them off?
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.560]   I don't know if it matters.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.760]   What do you think, Alex?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.240]   Well, I think that this is a, I think once again,
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.800]   it's not something that is a, you should get it right now.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.080]   I think it's a constant little low level attack at using a PC.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.720]   And I think that it actually is aimed at the middle.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   I don't think it's necessarily, I mean,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.480]   obviously people that are on one side enjoy it.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.520]   But I also think that's what's going on is there's a lot of people
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.040]   that are getting frustrated with their PCs.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.400]   They're getting frustrated with viruses.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.480]   I mean, I know that my, you know, my dad has this law firm.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.600]   And they bought PCs because they have one application that they couldn't run.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.440]   This is before, they bought them just before,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.520]   like six months before the Intel switchover.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.560]   But they were just, it's just incredibly,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.640]   they have an incredible amount of frustration with the PC.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.960]   They're not using it because they're proud of PCs
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.040]   or because they want PCs or whatever.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.840]   They're using it because they have something that they need to use it on.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.360]   And what's happening though, for us, for a lot of those people,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.240]   and I would argue that that's a huge margin of the PC users
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.160]   are using it because they need something else.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.280]   And even if it's only 10 or 15%, that'd be,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.760]   that's a huge market growth for Apple.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.480]   Of taking these people who are frustrated with their app
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.880]   and continually digging this little spike into them,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.080]   where they, when they get to the next one,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.520]   they're just like, "I don't care what I need to use.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.320]   I'm gonna," you know, and I think it just reminds them of the things
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.520]   they don't like about their PC.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I think that's really true.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.960]   I think PC owners aren't necessarily all that fond of them,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.080]   many of them anyway.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.800]   Those are the ones that are really going to win over.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.880]   Yeah, there's definitely people that are really into their PC,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.240]   and you're not going to win them over.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   And these ads aren't going to make any difference.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.000]   But I think that Mac users tend to be, they tend to be Mac users.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I mean, they're really excited about their computer.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.880]   They're to a level of almost religiousness oftentimes,
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.040]   where there's a huge chunk of PC,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.640]   and it was just by the fact that it's 95% of the market,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.480]   or 96% of the market, or whatever.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.120]   There's a big chunk of those users that just don't really care.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.000]   It's just the computer.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.640]   They barely know the difference between OS 10 and PCs.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.840]   And so this is starting to tell people, tell those people,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.720]   and even if it's only 10 or 15% of the market,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.920]   that's three or four times a larger market than what Apple has right now.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   So it doesn't have to be all of the PC users.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.160]   It only has to be those ones on that edge of just,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.280]   I can't deal with this anymore.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.120]   Something that Apple might want to cultivate is the feeling that Mac users have of being special,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.440]   and being kind of like the BMW owners.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.480]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.280]   If Apple doesn't have to get 10% market share, it's very profitable.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.040]   Maybe one of the ways to keep their current core group happy is to make them feel unique,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.520]   special.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.400]   Yeah, I think Alex put it really well, actually.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   It's so funny when I go out there and look at sites that are out there,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480]   and I say, oh, there's this software that looks really interesting.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.320]   And to somebody who uses a PC, it seems almost asinine to use a Mac to a lot of them.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.840]   Just because it's like breathing air, it's something that they don't even think about
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.800]   there being a second or third platform that's in contention.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.160]   But for those fensitters, for those people who like Alex said are getting a little bit,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.960]   they're starting to feel kind of uncomfortable about the way they've got to do these updates,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.400]   and they keep hearing all these terrible things.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.840]   Oh, I think there's a lot of that.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.360]   Yeah, and this might be the brand awareness kind of thing that kind of gets that interest high enough
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.560]   to check things out.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.760]   Fourth quarter for CS3 Adobe's Photoshop won't be universal until first quarter, I'm sorry,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.280]   of 2007.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.120]   Meanwhile, Contribute is out.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.640]   And there's been noise that Contribute is a shot across the bow of
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.520]   Apple.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.720]   Why do you think that is?
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.680]   What's going on, Alex?
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.320]   Well, what's going on right now is that Contribute has been released,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   but it's only running in emulation.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   So it's running in Apple.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.840]   It's not universal.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.440]   Yeah, it's not a universal application.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.880]   And that's a having a new app.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.560]   I mean, Adobe basically said, well, when we release the next version of things,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.000]   we'll upgrade things to Universal.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.960]   All across the board.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.640]   And the argument is Adobe, there's obviously talk that Adobe's upset about Apple moving
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   closer and closer and closer to their market.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:40.320]   First with video and then in some cases, audio and then also with photography, with aperture.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.920]   So there's is Adobe upset.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.760]   I personally don't think it is as I don't think the division.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.880]   I mean, I definitely think Adobe is frustrated with where Apple's going,
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.320]   but I'm not clear that this Contribute issue is really part of that.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.680]   For a couple of reasons.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.200]   One is that Contribute's not that doesn't have a lot of overhead.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.000]   It doesn't need to be.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.160]   It'll run just fine in Resata until they get to the point.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.680]   It is a lot of recode when you're doing, you know, for some applications,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.360]   it was an easy, it's a very quick fix to go to Universal and they did it quickly.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   I don't think I think a lot of the Adobe apps are legacy applications
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.480]   where there's just an enormous amount of code that's been there for a long time.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.560]   Making it all work universally is more complicated.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.680]   Well, especially Photoshop.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.640]   I can understand that.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.720]   I mean, that's a lot of work to get that work.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.400]   And the question is, is it really cost effective for Photoshop to be
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.560]   switched over until they were going to come out with a release anyway,
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.840]   which is scheduled.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.400]   Right.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.720]   I mean, rumors are, I don't know exactly what it's going to come out,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.080]   but rumors are sometime in the spring.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.240]   And I think that they promised it by March and the March.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.560]   Right.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.440]   So we'll probably see it around there.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.560]   And so I think that I don't know if Adobe is really trying to pick a fight.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.480]   I mean, I think that there is a looming battle between Apple and Adobe.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.600]   And I think it's one of those things kind of like us in North Korea,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.400]   or probably not that rough.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.160]   But there is, I think that there's an issue where Apple is starting to slowly
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.680]   encroach on where Adobe's going.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.360]   They could fairly easily reproduce, not all the features of Photoshop,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.640]   but a lot of them fairly quickly.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.560]   There's lots of rumors that there's an app and floating around inside of Apple
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   that will do a lot of what Photoshop will do.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.600]   But they won't release it unless Adobe did something like drop.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.640]   I mean, for both of them, they need each other because Apple represents,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.720]   you know, half the Photoshop users most likely.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.360]   And Adobe, obviously Photoshop is a huge driver for new machines,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.040]   and Apple would lose an enormous amount of the market that they're in,
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.680]   if for some reason Photoshop wasn't available.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.040]   So both of them have to constantly be developing the,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.520]   what will happen if that happened, that kind of thing.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.400]   But I don't think that helped.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.200]   >> Would you contribute, Merlin?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   Did you post something with contributing?
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.720]   >> You know, actually, I just downloaded contribute today.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.920]   I haven't had a chance to play with it yet.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.280]   I am, however, a long time Dreamweaver user.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.880]   And, you know, even as I like to think I know my way around HTML,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.600]   I still use that for projects.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.760]   Going back to Dreamweaver Ultra,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.360]   when you know you could first do PHP, MySQL integration.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.880]   And, you know, again, I can't speak because I have a news contribute yet.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.200]   What I will say is that it's been really frustrating
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.080]   with so many of these applications, like Dreamweaver,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.320]   to just see, I mean, the feature set, you know, you get,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.280]   I'll speak just from a user point of view, okay?
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.840]   And that is it feels like they update the palettes a little bit.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.120]   They add a little bit of stuff, but it just, it does not get any faster.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.800]   It's really painful to use.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.480]   And I don't know.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   I mean, there's so many applications out there that are shareware
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.800]   that do a lot of the event that people need out of an HTML development application.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.040]   And then on top of which you've got these kind of lightweight languages
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.160]   that are entering into it.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.960]   Where you don't need a lot of, you know, heavy integration.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.560]   People have been really getting excited about the blogging capability I contribute.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.720]   Tell me, what is that?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.560]   Well, it's got support for blogs.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.080]   So you can use it as a blogging.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.960]   I misunderstood you.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.400]   No, I see now that's terrific.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.360]   But I mean, again, it's, you know, it doesn't, it's still a need that's a strong need.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.080]   I don't, you know, again, I don't, I don't know what it's like to work
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.200]   inside of a company like Adobe and have to, you know, pull those teams together.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.120]   So I don't want to be, I don't want to be presumptuous.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.360]   But I can all I can say is from a user standpoint,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.840]   these things should be feeling a lot faster at this point.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.160]   You know, and, and, and for somebody like me who does,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.920]   so what I'll do is when I do it, like say I do a, a site for a friend's band,
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.440]   that's just the easiest way for me to do it.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.640]   It's very easy to make this dream.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.840]   We were not to fiddle dream.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.120]   We were absolutely.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.040]   But, you know, gosh, you make one change and you just sit there and watch that window churn
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.640]   and churn on this one little change.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.400]   And I don't know, I guess I'll play with contributing, get back to you next week.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.320]   But I think the blogging integration, that's terrific.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.640]   Ecto feels like it's kind of stuck in one place for a while.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.800]   So it'd be nice to see some ways to have.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.840]   Despite the daily updates, it's still less than soon beginning anywhere.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.240]   It's got a classic tire spinning in the mud there.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:57.120]   Hey Leo, I can jump in regarding the aperture, Apple controversy because I happen to know that
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.480]   something interesting happened during the development of aperture that a lot of people
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.200]   aren't talking about.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.600]   And that is that I don't know if it was formal or if it was coincidence,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   but one of the big shot Apple engineers went over to Adobe and one of the big shot Adobe
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.560]   Lightroom engineers came over to Apple and they switched jobs.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.160]   And that was during the development phase.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.680]   Was there a player to be named later or was it just an even trade?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.080]   Yeah, it was somebody moving out of the miners into the bigs.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.480]   No, I don't know whether that was a coordinated effort.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.520]   But what I do know is that they both clearly had access to inside information on the others
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.200]   projects because each had been coming out of the others camp.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.960]   So I don't really think there's a big aperture problem here in terms of that's why Adobe is mad
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.480]   because if you'll look at aperture, they've been very careful to make sure that there's
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.240]   no pixel editing or masking capabilities in aperture.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.680]   And I personally believe the reason why is they don't want to tick Adobe off.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.000]   We did a benchmark at call for help.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.400]   I've asked, I've been wondering about which is the fastest way to run Photoshop on a Mac these days.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:07.360]   Is it faster to run it in Rosetta, faster to run it in parallels as a Windows application
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.560]   or faster to run in boot camp?
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.640]   Of course boot camp is easily the fastest.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.080]   In fact, really the dirty little secret of Photoshop is that the Windows version of
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.360]   Photoshop has always been faster than the Mac version of Photoshop.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.600]   But even in parallels, it's faster than Rosetta.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.560]   So at this point, if you're...
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.800]   I think this is a big glaring hole in the going intel is this lack of a good Photoshop.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.960]   It is dog slow really for some of the things.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.440]   It is.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.120]   Hey, that's why I use aperture every day.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.720]   Is there anything else?
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.000]   Is there a risk that Adobe might lose its market lead by this delay?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.880]   Yeah, no.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.520]   There's nothing else.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.120]   I think that's why they're not in the rush.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.840]   I mean, there's nothing else that really goes head to head with Photoshop.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.600]   There's a lot of people that would like to say that they...
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.240]   I'm sitting here.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.760]   I just want to resize a file.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.560]   I have to watch Photoshop because I can't find anything better.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.480]   Resizing files you can do with Automator.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.880]   You can resize files.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.920]   I'm not going to fire up Automator to resize a single file.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.200]   That's funny thing.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.120]   The Photoshop has become such a name.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.440]   I mean, it's one of those names like Google or Kleenex.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.280]   It just becomes synonymous with photo editing.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.360]   And the fact of the matter is way beyond 80/20 people.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.520]   I think if you took any five Photoshop users, at least at the lower end,
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.480]   they're probably using about the same 10% of features by and large.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.280]   I mean, if you're like me, you're doing Gossym Bloor, you're doing Unsharp Mask.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.920]   Just a few things that digital photographers use.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.880]   But it's so funny to have that be so synonymous and to have...
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.520]   I mean, am I wrong?
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   Did this not get its start on the Mac back in the day?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.520]   Was Photoshop not first?
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   It was Photoshop was Mac only.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.760]   I mean, I still got a little sore spot from the whole Quark Express experience a few years back.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.800]   So, I mean, maybe they don't need Macs anymore, but it sure would be surprising to just kind of
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.280]   see that market share out of some kind of a perceived question.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.400]   That's not going to happen.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.800]   That's not going to happen.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   That just seems very hard to believe.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.240]   I think I still think Apple represents half of Adobe's customer base.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.000]   And so with Photoshop specifically.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.800]   And so I don't...
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.680]   It's probably 40, 50%.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.120]   And the other thing that's important to remember is generally...
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.920]   There was a staff that...
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.200]   I don't know if it's still true, but this was probably four or five years ago that the
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   staff that I saw go by that said the top...
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.480]   Let me think about this correctly.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.920]   90% of the top 10 percentile of publishing, so of graphics and everything else.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.480]   So 9 out of 10 people in the top 10 percentile were using Macs.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.560]   So, and that means...
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.720]   What we're talking about is ad agencies and the higher end pieces.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.600]   They need that market.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.880]   That's a big market for them.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   So that while you may see half of the Photoshop users are using PCs,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:45.440]   the ones at the top are generally using OS 10 or more are using Macs and are pretty religious
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:45.840]   about it.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.920]   And I think that the real question is that...
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:55.360]   The reason I don't think this will ever happen, I just can't imagine Adobe going down that path
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.160]   is because if Adobe dropped OS 10, Apple would release something very, very fast.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.080]   And I think Adobe would find very quickly that the users are more committed to Apple than they are
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.360]   to Photoshop.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.160]   And I think that that's why I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.080]   And I think Adobe knows that pretty clearly.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.200]   So I don't think that there's going to be...
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.640]   I'm actually frustrated that we don't see some of the...
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.080]   I think they're giving up space.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.040]   I think Adobe's giving up room that they don't need to give up when it comes to...
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.200]   I would love to use Audition on the Mac.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.840]   I'd love to use...
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.040]   Things premiere would be useful on the Mac.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.920]   There's some stuff that's on that that would be useful there.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.400]   I'm surprised that they gave up as much space as they did in that area.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.320]   And I think they're getting kind of...
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.200]   Because it's just painful.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.560]   The infrastructure around...
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.120]   On a PC, around media development.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.320]   It's just not that good.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.880]   And so...
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.720]   A couple of upsets moving along on the iTunes movie store.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:53.760]   A, we're starting to see, well, is it ads or promos in lost?
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.120]   Which, if you pay for a TV show, you kind of hope you're not going to see any time wasting promos.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.760]   You know, we pay for movies and we see them.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.320]   I mean...
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.760]   Yeah, it's gonna say you bought a DVD lately.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.440]   It's in death march to get to the open.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:05.920]   Good points.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.960]   And then the other one, which I think is more serious, is...
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.840]   According to a number of people, the quality of some of these iTunes movies
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.800]   leads a lot to be desired.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:23.920]   It looks like they're merely upscaling the lower quality movies from 320 to 640.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.800]   And as a result, you get highly pixelated movies.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.480]   I have to say, I got the Life Aquatic Steve Zisu, and it looks terrible.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.040]   Far from DVD quality.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.840]   And apparently, and some of these things, Apple's just upscaling them
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.240]   until it gets a higher quality version in there.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.160]   And you're not just talking about the movie.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.280]   Your predictions are vindicated, Scott.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.480]   That's right.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.840]   Your predictions come true.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.200]   I'm enjoying my DVDs on a regular basis.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.360]   And my 50-inch television is shrunk to 49 inches.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.880]   But other than that, everything's fun.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.240]   The shrinkage.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.120]   Is it cold water?
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.240]   Is that the problem?
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.800]   That's it.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.400]   I think this...
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.520]   I mean, Apple's doing this.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.400]   And there seems to be...
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.720]   There's enough evidence and enough screenshots on the net to make it seem like it's pretty true.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.640]   That's reprehensible.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:17.280]   Now, here I am paying, what is it, $14.99 for a movie that is a 320 by 240 image scaled up.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.160]   I mean, that's awful.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.240]   Surely they can do better than that.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.840]   Well, I think that for me...
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.160]   So it's actually the films that we think are getting scaled up?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.560]   Parent?
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.640]   Well, yeah, I'll find the article.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.200]   But...
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.480]   I thought it was the TV shows that were just looked like they were the same.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.400]   TV shows, and I think some films as well.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.040]   Yeah, because I know that some of the TV shows were doing that.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.720]   My guess was with the TV shows was that what that was really revolved around us,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.840]   that they just can't get the new one.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.480]   You had them.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.960]   Every single TV show, and that will happen over time.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.200]   That was my guess, but that could be wrong.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.640]   Did you guys talk about this last week?
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.440]   Am I bringing up a...
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.440]   Beat that, okay.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:53.840]   No, no.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.400]   We didn't talk.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.880]   But I do want to say that my junk looks very good.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.680]   My yong, I think you called it.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.800]   I've been playing the bedazzled, which I like.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.560]   I mean, the control interface isn't a frow of an iPod, it's not ideal,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.760]   but it's kind of nice to have gay and the sound is great on the games.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.240]   A decent game on the...
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.720]   I haven't stopped playing my junk since last week's show.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.160]   I'm addicted.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.000]   I haven't changed phones in 7 days.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.640]   Oh, come on.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.520]   Surely you've changed your clothes.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.440]   Quit calling me Shirley Leo.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.280]   You put in here a...
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.320]   Have you played any of these games, Merlin or Alex?
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:34.880]   Anybody else?
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.320]   I like the...
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.520]   The jeweled, I said bedazzled, bedjouled a lot.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.440]   I haven't played a video game since Yara's revenge, but...
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.360]   I don't think they have that yet.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.800]   Can I get that?
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.160]   Can I get that from my iPod?
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.040]   Hang in there.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.160]   It's only a matter of time.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.200]   I don't remember that game.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.440]   You're a ghost named Yara on a quest in space.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.400]   I don't know if you remember that.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.640]   I have historically addicted to Tetris and it's...
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.600]   Tetris would be a good game on the other side.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.520]   Yeah, because you could rotate really as much too.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.760]   The rotate really is much better than the keys that I've been using for a long time.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.720]   And so it's actually...
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.080]   Tetris works really, really well.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.240]   And I kind of wish I hadn't put it on my iPod.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.760]   I'd love to see somebody port some of the old kind of text-based games.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.560]   We're doing an iPod.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.440]   How would you enter it?
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.000]   I guess you could select choices from a menu.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.600]   Well, yeah, but think about the interface.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.320]   It's pretty perfect for going through some kind of a text adventure.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.320]   I want Tetris.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.280]   I want to play...
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:29.680]   Not Tetris.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.760]   On their mind.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.320]   I lost it.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.960]   It's the one where you...
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.440]   You can't really ask for it if you don't know the name, Alex.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.400]   I just don't want to hint.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.800]   You need to know the name.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.480]   People would do that when I worked in a record strip.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.600]   People would do that all the time and say,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.320]   "You know that song?
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.040]   I want that song.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.920]   What's that song that goes, you know, "Mama, and I go..."
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.080]   You never did the morning show.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.720]   Same thing.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.520]   When they start coming to you.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   Yeah, they start coming and you're just like, "Oh, I don't know."
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.720]   It's a job you do.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.520]   I'll try to get it on for you.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.000]   Thanks for coming.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.360]   That's it.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.080]   Of course, that's the dirty little secret of the request line.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.280]   It doesn't matter what they ask for.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.080]   Yeah, I'll try to get it on.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.600]   And if it's in high rotation, they're in luck.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.680]   Yeah, it depends on how sexy their voice was when they called me.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.640]   You know what I learned.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.360]   I have to say, and I think every DJ learns this early on.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.000]   And eventually every radio listener learns it early on.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.800]   The better the voice, the worse the looks.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.800]   That's why I work in radio.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.440]   I'm a face made for net casting.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.960]   A face made for net casting.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.920]   Michael Robertson, the guy who did MP3.com, he's doing linspire right now.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.000]   He's doing a SIP phone.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.520]   It has come forward saying, "The Zoom will be the biggest flop of 2007."
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.960]   I don't know what he's standing is for this statement though.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.080]   That could be harsh, but I don't think it's going to be a hit.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.000]   I think that he says less than 50,000 units worldwide.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.360]   I think he's completely wrong.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.040]   In fact, having played with a Zoom now, and you played with the two, Alex,
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.280]   I actually have a higher opinion than I did before.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.840]   I have a much higher opinion since I started to play with it.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.920]   So I will say that when it first came out, when I looked at the opportunity,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.160]   what they were working on, I was like, "Yeah, right."
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.840]   But when I played with it, I was actually more impressed with it than I thought.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   Now, the question is, would I be willing to get it in addition to my iPod?
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.920]   And possibly, and I think some of that is connected in the same way that the iPod
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.520]   was connected to iTunes.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.080]   I think some of that's connected to Soapbox, and how good Soapbox gets,
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.960]   and what they're going to do.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.720]   That's the video store that Microsoft's going to do.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.800]   And so I have to say, if the Zoom supported the iTunes music store,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.240]   I would prefer it over an iPod.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.520]   Really?
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.480]   See, that's the problem.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.960]   That's always been the issue with all of these players.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.360]   They don't have an iTunes music store.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.520]   And one thing we know for sure, Leo, you wouldn't be listening to any netcast on your Zoom.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.120]   No, nor podcast neither.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.280]   Speaking of which is like, hello, what no, I mean, of all the things to leave off.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:51.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.000]   I mean, that's sort of like having a golf course with no grass.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.200]   I have to think that some of it is the word podcast.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.640]   They just don't want to put the word on there.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.720]   I mean, they've got 1,700 lawyers at Microsoft.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.200]   They cannot be scared of Steve Jobs.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.560]   Speaking of renaming campaigns, Robertson also says he's been looking
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.360]   for a good word to describe what happens when you lose all your music to copy protection.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.240]   And he says, I think the word is zoomed.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.200]   I've been zoomed.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.680]   I can't play my songs.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.720]   I've been zoomed.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.960]   And you know, this is one neologism that might stick.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.160]   Forget netcast.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.240]   I'm putting my money behind the zoom horse.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.040]   I think he's absolutely that's a great word.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.840]   I've been zoomed.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.040]   He says the real problem with the zoom is the copy protection.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.160]   He might be right.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.360]   Well, that's the problem for everyone.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:44.960]   I mean, everybody has, they have not made the DRM fairly transparent.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.320]   Well, the way it is in iTunes.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.520]   It's much better in iTunes.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.480]   It's there.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.280]   It's still there.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.240]   It doesn't go away.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.360]   Right.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.880]   I mean, I think that it is, part of it is that Apple,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.160]   and I've said this before, Apple really focuses on the consumer.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.160]   I think a lot of other ones really focus on how do we develop our relationship with Hollywood,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.600]   because they don't have as much leverage.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.200]   And I think that what we ended up with on iTunes was this compromise between what Apple wanted
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.720]   and what Hollywood wanted, whereas when we look at what other people are doing,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.880]   they're just asking Hollywood, "Well, how do you want us to handle it?"
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   And Hollywood tells them, "And I don't think it's good for Hollywood to get what they want."
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.960]   Because it's way too restrictive.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.800]   It isn't workable.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.640]   And they're just going to keep on allowing Apple to move further and further forward.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.520]   But one thing to just play devil's advocate here, like we just, we spent a few minutes.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.440]   They're talking about how great and smart, you know, Mac users are and how well-informed we are
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.400]   about all these things.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.480]   I mean, isn't there some kind of a corollary in place here where, I mean,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.720]   so we're really into Macs or Mac people, whatever.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.560]   But, you know, I mean, could it also be that there are some folks sitting around,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:54.080]   in the five overstates waiting for the Microsoft player to come along?
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.440]   You know, and they're not going to sit there and read a bunch of CNET articles about DRM.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.960]   They're going to say, "Is this the Microsoft player?"
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.160]   And they're going to buy it.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.800]   You know, I guess I just think that his, the Robertson guy, who's he who's done some great things,
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.400]   that was a pretty red-faced kind of screaming.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.600]   It's a good way to get attention.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.400]   Editorial.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.000]   Yeah, but I mean, let's, let's be honest.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.760]   I mean, you know, sometimes beta doesn't win and, and sometimes people have sprint for their phone
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.840]   carrier and sometimes people rent coffee tables.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.400]   There's all kinds of weird consumer decisions that go on that aren't happening at the very
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.680]   highest level of cognition.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.200]   And just to say out of hand, because there's the CRM's problem, this is going to fail.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.240]   I don't know.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.480]   I can tell you why it's going to fail.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.000]   I have the answer.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.520]   You cannot fail.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.280]   You cannot claim my Zhang on the zoo.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:46.000]   The interesting article in the computer world from Mike Elgin, who says that
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.040]   "Zoon scares Apple to the core, mostly because of the viral and the social element of it," which,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.240]   which makes kind of sense.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.160]   I think one of the things the zoo has going for it is this ability to share songs.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.480]   I mean, I think the kids, the kids will dig that.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.200]   I think I'm too old for that.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.520]   I think I'm too old because I don't want to share my song.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.960]   You can't have my songs.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.760]   You're my song.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.920]   No, I just like when I'm when I'm shot.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.880]   They go, "Hey, listen to this.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.680]   You're going to love this."
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.080]   Yeah, Leo, you're going to try like crazy to share Jesus Christ superstar with you.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   No takers anywhere.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.360]   I mean, also then, I mean, just to kind of flip around and be the other devil's advocate.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.080]   I mean, but isn't that the problem with the DRM is the sharing is kind of a huge pain in the butt?
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.440]   Well, you know, it's easy to share, but you only get three plays or three days.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.560]   You're limited exactly.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.360]   You're limited in that.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.600]   So I think that's what makes it.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   I mean, that was the key to making sharing work is that it does facilitate that and something
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.800]   you can't do in an iPod.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.480]   You know, go ahead, try to bump your iPod to somebody else's iPod and send this song over.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.400]   At least you've got three days or three plays.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.520]   Right.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.600]   Yeah, I've always thought that was kind of crazy about the DRM.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.120]   I mean, if there's anything that you learn about the way this stuff works virally,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.000]   it's that you can just slip stuff to people and people like that.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.120]   The fan and go and buy it and you know, you would do that.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.760]   If you walked up to me and say, hey, have you heard the latest Sloan?
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.440]   I could see you.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.320]   Exactly.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.400]   I have to admit that I find the hotels, oddly enough hotels in Canada,
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.080]   I don't know why it's not as much in the US, but when I'm in Canada for tech TV,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:24.240]   I'm almost always there's almost like six to eight of people's limewire
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.960]   connections that are showing up there.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.520]   You're right.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.480]   You're right.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:28.960]   So there's this.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.600]   Well, the thing is that for some reason limewire, the folder is shareable automatically,
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.400]   I think.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.080]   And so you don't see the rest of their collection.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   You see their limewire collection in iTunes.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.280]   And I do admit that it's kind of fun to listen to their music instead of my music.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.960]   And, you know, and I learn a lot about songs that I wouldn't.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.840]   You can't download them.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.680]   You can't move them back and forth, you know, over iTunes sharing stuff.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.200]   So I can see how that might be useful.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.360]   But, you know, I think that the hard part is is that if I could buy that song with Wi-Fi,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.680]   you know, right now you can trade the songs back and forth,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.160]   but I still have to go back and buy it somewhere else.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.600]   I can't buy it over the Wi-Fi.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.440]   Well, to round back up to an old Evergreen of ours,
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.040]   this is also something where the notion of an Apple phone gets really interesting.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.640]   Because if you do have the ability,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.240]   by discoverability to say, well, you know, let's say just for the sake of argument that
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.000]   you have something as crummy as that three-play DRM deal,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.120]   that's still a pretty good gig.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.520]   If I see somebody who has an iPod phone or whatever you want to call it,
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.040]   and I say, okay, I want to be able to beam them almost like a contact from Palm.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.520]   So they send them this Sloane song and they get to listen to it a couple times.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.240]   And if they like it, I think that'd be...
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.080]   No, do you think that's the kind of thing that the labels in the studios would freak out about?
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.040]   No, that's the whole point.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.640]   That's why the three days are three plays.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.560]   I think it's a question.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.040]   I think more than that they'd freak out, but I think they love this idea.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.880]   Because guess what happens after three plays?
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.040]   You get a button that says, buy this song.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.920]   When you've got...
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.360]   You've just captured a customer for free.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.160]   Again, somebody else is paying for it.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.960]   It's wonderful.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.120]   It's every record labels dream.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.200]   It's like free load.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.760]   Who's slowed?
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.800]   You don't want to know.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.880]   Don't get Merlin started.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.400]   Go ahead.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.480]   I'll tell you what you know what I'm going to do tonight, Scott?
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.720]   I'm going to burn you a new wax cylinder.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.520]   I'm going to have the Pony Express bring it down to you.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.640]   Is Neil Young in that band?
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.080]   Neil Young.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.360]   Yeah, he's from Canadian.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.560]   So, you know, he could be.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.040]   He could be.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.120]   Some day they'll have a...
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   You know, I wonder actually the rock and roll heaven,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.960]   the Canadian wing is fantastic.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.280]   That's where you want to go.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.720]   Interesting.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.240]   Some day Gordon Lightfoot.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.400]   Some day.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.160]   Well, I read my mind.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.360]   No, actually, really.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.160]   Some of the best Canadian artists are still alive,
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   which is much more than you could say for the US.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.160]   A little known fact, Canadians don't die.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:42.560]   They don't die.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.600]   A lot of people never know.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.800]   No, it's remarkable.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.240]   It's the free healthcare.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.720]   Exactly.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.520]   You know what?
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.480]   Let's do a future episode that's just about Canada.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.040]   Can we do that?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.760]   I would love to.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.280]   I'm become a Canadian fan.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.800]   You know, I go up there now every month.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.400]   And isn't it great?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.680]   Merlin's going to come back now.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.120]   We got Merlin on the Canadian.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.560]   I'm so hooked on Canada now.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.160]   No, I love Toronto.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.560]   So, I mean, you know, it's definitely a trip I look forward to.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.680]   So, I tried to move there in 1970 when I was...
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.200]   That was another chord by somebody...
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.680]   You got flat feet and everything was okay, right?
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.520]   [laughs]
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.400]   I wish I had...
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.240]   I don't have on my new Mac Pro.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   I wish I had the Sony Drive.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.160]   I have, unfortunately, one of the Mac Pros
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.000]   with a Pioneer Drive in it.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.160]   But for those who have Mac Pros with the Sony DWD150A,
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.320]   there's a hack on HardMac, hardmac.com,
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.040]   for turning it into an even better drive.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.680]   This is wild.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.840]   Apparently, somebody had the good sense to look up
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.040]   in the Sony catalog.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.560]   There is no DW150A.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.040]   Apple has done some deal with Sony
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.600]   that allows them to rebrand a better NEC drive.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.200]   It's faster.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   It burns more media.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.320]   It does DVD RAM.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.960]   And there's a simple firmware upgrade.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.360]   Well, not that simple, but there's a 12-step firmware upgrade
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.760]   that you can make that will turn your...
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.640]   Now, guys, I was going to do it
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.440]   before the show.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.760]   I thought, I feel confident.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.560]   You changed your...
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.520]   You're crazy.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.760]   You flash the firmware in your DVD drive.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.480]   And if I had only had that drive, I would have done it.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.800]   This is operating on yourself with a stake nut.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.040]   Your kernel is going to be good.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.720]   Quick, give me a big pen.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.000]   He needs a trick.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.280]   You're going to have a nice, shiny thing
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.640]   to put Post-It notes on.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.800]   My favorite thing about this, Leo,
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.280]   is you always try these experiments nanoseconds
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.160]   before the show.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.440]   Right. It's not working.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.320]   It's not working.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.840]   Last week, I installed 1048,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   and I couldn't even restart my computer
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.960]   after I finished the install.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.920]   I've heard a little bit more.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.040]   I'm going to be able to complain about 1048.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.080]   I didn't have any problems.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.880]   1048.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.520]   An Intel problem or a G5 problem?
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.280]   It appears that it's an Intel problem.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.720]   And from the anecdotal evidence that's showing up,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.000]   people that I've talked to,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.960]   most of the anomalies are showing up on Intel Max.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.360]   There's a lot of new stuff in 1048.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.840]   Did you fix your permissions before you installed?
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.200]   I did not.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.560]   You're the other thing.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.080]   You know you're supposed to do that.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.520]   Oh, you laugh, but it's true.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.040]   There's a lot.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.920]   The patron saint of Macintosh's John Gruber
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.120]   has a terrific post on this from, I guess, probably a year or so.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.280]   Because you remember Zeldman had posted this really great thing
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.680]   about the kind of rain dance chicken waving he does
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.800]   before any update.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.560]   And Gruber went through and kind of along.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   It's very, very loud.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.640]   It's like, you know, I didn't find the head of Alfredo Garcia.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.560]   And place it in the middle of a room.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.360]   Draw a circle.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.680]   Say jobs three times.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.840]   I'm up in single user mode.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.000]   Now you have to drink three times.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.520]   A body of Christ commands you.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.360]   It's funny because it's true.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.720]   I bet it's actually one that I do.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.680]   I do two things straight off the Gruber/Zeldman.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.280]   You get an old priest and a young priest.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.120]   Oh, banana.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.920]   The, um, no, but a two that I believe very much.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.880]   And number one is weight.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.120]   I mean, this is just, I mean, seriously,
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   if you can, unless you are really bleeding and just crashing all the time,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.720]   consider waiting for at least a day.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.440]   That's probably a good idea.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.840]   And then when you do, I mean, I think, I think, so I use something called Applejack.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.800]   Do you guys use that at all?
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.520]   No, what's that?
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.200]   Applejack is a single user that basically installs as a, so you can,
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.920]   when you start up in single user mode, you come up in bash or whatever.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.520]   And you run this thing from the command line.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.200]   So even if your, your card is host or, you know, you, or if you're,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.480]   the GUI part is host, you can come up and use Applejack to repair permissions.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.640]   And the Macmatic told me about this.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:39.520]   It's a nice app.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.960]   It needs an update for Intel, but anyway, I would say the waiting and then doing the
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.600]   repair, the, the repairing your permissions.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.760]   I do think the, the, the, your permissions makes sense.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.280]   I'm like a lot of that other voodoo.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.160]   If you have a file that the update can't modify because its permissions are incorrect,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:54.800]   you're going to have it.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.920]   You may well have a bad.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.000]   And running, I would also always run FSCK, you know, just, just, just to make sure,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.680]   because sometimes there's little dings on your hard drive from crashing and quitting.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.080]   You can, you know, you can screw yourself up with that pretty bad.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.080]   You want to run permissions.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.880]   Sorry, Alex.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.160]   You want to run permissions from safe mode to really do the good job.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.320]   And that means holding down the shift key when you boot or do you mean in single user mode?
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.800]   Holding down the shift key.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.120]   Okay.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.000]   And then finally, it takes a while because it, it's, it's running a full FSCK.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.200]   If I remember correctly, it runs a full FSCK anytime you do safe mode.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:27.680]   Does anybody.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.480]   Oh, is that true?
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.400]   That's why it takes so long.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.680]   And you get to the little spinning.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.600]   FSCK is the file system check.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.400]   FSCK is the file.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.880]   FSCK.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.280]   And finally, you know, it's tempting.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.000]   And this is what I did.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.880]   And I have to admit, I got a little bit relaxed about it because I haven't had any issues for
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.440]   a long time.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.760]   And I just kind of, you know, I saw it in software update and figured, well, okay, fine.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.960]   You know, because it was, it was in a long list of other updates that were coming in.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.480]   And, and it was a big list.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:56.960]   It wasn't it.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.560]   There was all the online stuff.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.360]   And so anyway, so the, so I just ran it and didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.480]   And of course, it wouldn't restart.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.400]   And one of the things is using the combo install.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   So there's a, you know, you can download and install, you know, they update and actually run it
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:16.480]   rather than using system update in which the guys here told me that that's how they got it back
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.640]   up again was to, was to do that.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.360]   And so, you know, me, I, I do one install.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:21.840]   It doesn't work.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.600]   And then I just hand it to you know, so I'm like, a luther.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.720]   You didn't make this thing work.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.920]   We all need a luther.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.480]   He disappears.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.680]   I know we do all need.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.720]   Where's my luther?
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.200]   Is his name luther or you just call him a luther?
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.480]   A luther is his name.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.120]   A luther.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.120]   So, so anyway, so no, you just, you just, you just, you just, you just hand it to him.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.360]   And then I came back a couple hours and it was working.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.480]   And it was all good.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.800]   So, um, so we have a shopping.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.280]   Any other news stories before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.520]   None.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.360]   I going once going twice.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:55.760]   All right.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.040]   Merlin, I think you've got like three picks of the week.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.920]   Well, you know, this is, as, as usual, I have nothing of substance to contribute to
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.160]   anything that you guys are talking about, except to say that there are applications that I'm excited about.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:08.480]   Thank you.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:08.800]   Different.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.360]   Tonight, tonight on Fishing for Compliments.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.440]   But the, but I am, I am very excited about a program.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:20.160]   Apparently Scott's been using this since, since he was a youngster during the nuclear administration.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.520]   But there's a, with your permission, Leo, I'll, I'll, uh,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.560]   call and mention something that we saw on call for help.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:26.800]   Yes.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.680]   You and Cali.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.600]   So I was up in, in, uh, in Canadia, uh, shooting call for help with you guys.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.720]   And, uh, one of the sessions I was not in, you guys were demoing something, uh, called video queue.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.520]   Something Cali's been using on geek briefs in state one, I guess.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.000]   Uh,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.960]   Which is just remarkable.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.440]   Blooming away.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   The quality of what she, she gets with that is amazing.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.760]   But in a nutshell, uh, because, you know, the world needs more personal blogging.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.320]   This is a vlogging tool or a, a vlogging or whatever.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.000]   You make video podcasts with it.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.280]   It's really drop dead simple.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.560]   You, you type in a little bit of a script and then it's just drag and drop.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.160]   You just say, I want my eye, you know, so for example, I went this camera view at this point.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.680]   I went this title at this point.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.080]   And it's almost like, if you remember back in the day with premiere,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.400]   that kind of an approach of dragging and dropping,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.920]   it's super easy, super functional and it just spits out video and no time.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.080]   Something that I shared with Alex a little earlier today,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.760]   this is the first app I've come across.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.000]   First consumer app that makes it really easy to do some kind of video work with two cameras
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.800]   simultaneously.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.520]   It's pretty cool.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.600]   I have to say, everything's key to your script.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.360]   So when you get to that point in your script, your lower third graphics come on,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.400]   and you get to another point in your script, the camera switches.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.440]   That's right.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.560]   And actually the more I think about it, the more it really does remind me of premiere now
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.280]   that I think about it.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.920]   But you know what it reminds me of?
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.080]   A multi-million dollar demo that Sony did at NAB about 10 years ago of the ultimate
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.400]   newsroom where they had a scripting program that did all of this.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.040]   And they said, look, one person could do the entire thing.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.520]   And it was millions of dollars.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.320]   And this is 90 bucks for the full package, 40 bucks for the basic package.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.360]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.120]   Yeah, I totally bought it today.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.400]   Now, what camera are you going to use good cameras for?
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.600]   I mean, could you have two cameras?
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.520]   Well, I like to have the quality of my cameras roughly be roughly equivalent to the quality of
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.000]   my content.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.520]   So now I'm using the built-in Mac Pro camera, and I'm using as the second one,
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.480]   using my old eyesight camera.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.920]   And it just works like a champ.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.880]   Great idea.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.360]   Did you find it pretty easy to use and pretty transparent?
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.120]   When you were demoing it?
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.240]   Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:24.960]   It couldn't have been simply.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.520]   How about you, Scott?
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.000]   You said you've known this program for a while.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.920]   Well, actually, the way I use it every day and the way I use it is as a teleprompter.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.760]   That's the fundamental core.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.440]   But then you have these other tracks that you can say, when you say that,
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   put my name down below me.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.160]   But, see, I don't actually record video podcasts with it.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.800]   I just use it as a teleprompter when I'm reading spots.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.840]   You don't even record it.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.720]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.640]   I just use it as a teleprompter when I'm reading spots.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.960]   I throw it up on a 30-inch Apple Cinematist's Blend.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.840]   It's, you know, instead of buying a multi-million dollar teleprompter,
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.280]   I got a $40 teleprompter.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:57.760]   Clever.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.840]   And it's really, really cool because I have to read a lot of radio spots.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.760]   And, you know, it's just easier to put them up.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.040]   And you can actually dial in.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.600]   You can say, OK, this is a 60-second spot.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.040]   It'll put the little red bar across the thing in 60 seconds
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   so that you know how fast you've got to pace yourself.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.080]   That's amazing.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.040]   It's just so you know, it's Vera, software.com, V-A-R-A, software1word.com.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.800]   And I've just started playing with it,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.560]   but I just kind of get a feel with it.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.680]   But I'm going to probably come with you.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.480]   Is that how you shot your telephone man pieces?
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.800]   That's a famous character among the phone guy.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.200]   It's a guy who talks loudly in public into his wallet.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:31.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.600]   And so that's up on YouTube.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.920]   But yeah, so that's-- I'm going to start doing some 43 folder stuff
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.560]   in this, verisoftware.com.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:38.880]   How about--
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.080]   Just brought to you by Merlin Mann.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.040]   Merlin Mann.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.080]   How about you, Scott Bourne.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.480]   Do you have a--
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.680]   I hate all of you so much.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.960]   No, I think this is great.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.840]   Do you have a--
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.560]   I have a pick and it's a really cool little app.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.480]   And I can top everybody in terms of price because it's for me.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.840]   For me.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.400]   Comes from our friends at Rogue Amoeba.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.560]   And anything they make is cool because their name is Rogue Amoeba.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.400]   It's called SoundSource.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.120]   And if you're like me and you've always got all kinds of things
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.400]   plugged into your Mac microphones and mixers,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.280]   you can just call this little thing up off the menu bar
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.640]   and select which input and output device you want.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:14.880]   Wow.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.320]   And you don't have to go to the system admin
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.760]   panel and do all this.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.400]   You can go to Rogue Amoeba and download this puppy for free
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.360]   and man, is it cool?
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.120]   And I'm using it as we speak.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.840]   How will you?
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.720]   That sounds great.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.840]   I'm going to get that.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   Because I spend a lot of time in the Sound Control panel
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.760]   trying to figure out what's pointing to what.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.360]   Yeah, you know, we always do that.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.800]   You know, we're trying to record and we're going,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.080]   is this thing on?
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.120]   And why is it working?
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.560]   Does it work with Soundflower?
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.920]   I mean, if you have a lot of other channels,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.640]   will it work with it?
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.840]   It works with anything.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.000]   It works with Gizmo.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.280]   It works with Skype.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.640]   It works with iChat.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.520]   It works with--
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.000]   Right.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.160]   And it's free at Rogue Amoeba.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.520]   It's called Sound Source.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.160]   This is our session.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:52.720]   This is our session.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.760]   Pick from Rogue Amoeba.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.240]   And Scott, I'm breaking the rule here and looking at the web
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   while we're talking about the freebies page at Rogue Amoeba.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   It looks like it's loaded with really good stuff.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:02.720]   Oh, those guys are--
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.160]   It looks like a lot of little utilities
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.760]   that are super useful.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.120]   That you have to have all of them.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.000]   But this is by far the most valuable, in my opinion.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.320]   And these guys really specialize in simple, easy to use products
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.880]   that just do like one thing really well.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.640]   And I will never ever own a Mac again without Sound Source.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.280]   Sounds great.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.600]   The spot Gels was brought to you by--
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.160]   It ought to be brought to you by, but it is not.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   Now let's turn to Alex Lindsey and see what--
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.120]   I've got two again.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:31.600]   Two?
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.720]   Good, because I don't have one.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.520]   So you'll do--
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.400]   Okay, I got one for you.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:34.640]   Two for me.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.440]   All right.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.920]   So one is just to extend a little bit of what Merlin was talking about
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.360]   is that one that I'm testing that I'm actually pretty excited about,
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:50.960]   also from Vera Software is Wirecast 2, which is the kind of the big brother of a video queue.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.600]   So Wirecast will actually let you use Fire Wire Cameras,
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.480]   as well as--
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.040]   Wow.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.720]   You can have three sources and add those, add a lot pieces.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.680]   You can actually do a live broadcast with Wirecast,
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.960]   although you still need the bandwidth somewhere, which I'm still working on.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.720]   So anyway, but you can.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.320]   Here's the big things different between Wirecast 2 and other options.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.200]   There used to be-- there still is this program called Channel Storm.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.400]   And I was so-- it came out in like 2001, and I was really, really excited
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.600]   that you could switch between all these cameras, you could add your graphics,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.080]   but it would never let you put a source file, like a high quality source file on the hard drive.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.760]   And that's something that Wirecast 2 will let you do.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.880]   So even if you're not broadcasting, you can have three camera switch,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   you can be switching back and forth adding graphics,
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.080]   and when you're done, you're done.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.440]   And you have it all recorded, and then you can go into your compression,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.200]   and then you can put it up as a podcast.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.720]   And we're going to be experimenting with your camera's layout.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.560]   I was wondering what happened to those cameras.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.720]   They're still here.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:54.480]   But we're going to be doing a three camera test actually today or tomorrow with Wirecast to see,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.120]   because when we did TWIT, we would have to sit there and we'd shoot them all separately.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.840]   It would be great to be sitting there with a G5, and when we're done with it, it's ready to post.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.880]   All this stuff just makes me want to do some video
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.600]   podcast or some kind, is to use this stuff.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.640]   Just me just sitting in my office do something.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.680]   If I had a character like the phone guy, I'd do it.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.280]   But that's a really good point though, Leo.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.560]   I mean, this is just part 35 of this rant for me,
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.960]   which is whether it's podcasts or whether it's video podcast,
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.040]   or whether it's blogging or whether it's whatever.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.200]   These tools are sufficiently easy to use,
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.520]   which you can capture just these kind of little bag of tells,
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.400]   these little moments.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.520]   You don't have to go out there and start out with some kind of unified
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.120]   field theory for content on the web.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.120]   I mean, God knows there's enough of that out there.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.880]   This really enables people, if they've got a little funny thing,
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.640]   they want to do it, to go out and do it.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.000]   And it's so lightweight.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.240]   In some ways, the way that you can blame Bob Dylan for all the terrible songwriting,
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.360]   kicking off the songwriter phase that led to so many terrible songwriters,
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.800]   this will probably birth a thousand terrible podcasts.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.480]   But there'll be some great ones too.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.640]   And I love the ease of use of this stuff.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.520]   I think it's tremendous.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.360]   I just don't have the bag of tells to do it.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.240]   I mean, I feel like...
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.400]   I've seen your bag of tells.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.600]   If I have bigger bag of tells, I might try something.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.240]   But you know, it'd be...
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.040]   But go easy on the bag of tells.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.440]   All right.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:09.760]   All right.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.440]   And you said...
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.840]   You had a second besides Wirecast, you said you have a...
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.720]   So my second one that I just love is Omni Graffle.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.640]   Now, I don't know if you guys have played with Omni Graffle.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.600]   Everybody's got it.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.400]   It comes with your...
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:22.960]   Everybody's got it.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.560]   Everybody's got some version of it.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.000]   Are you using the pro version?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.120]   Yeah, I use the pro version.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.280]   And the Omni Graffle and Omni Outliner is great too.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.480]   But Omni Graffle lets you build these great little flow charts
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.040]   and great charts.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.800]   And I use them for a lot of my...
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.080]   You know, stuff when I'm trying to describe very complex.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.760]   You know, this is how all this stuff comes together.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.600]   This is how the visual effects pipeline works.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.000]   Or this is how we need to handle the bay or whatever.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.160]   It does a lot of the stuff for you.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   All the little links between little arrows and everything.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:54.480]   Just kind of jump and lock from box to box really easily.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.600]   And then drag along with it.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.800]   So you could do it in Illustrator.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.160]   You could do it in a drawing program.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.040]   But then every time you decide, oh, the boxes aren't quite what I want.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.040]   If you had a whole bunch of stuff flowing into one box,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.960]   you just grab onto that box and move it.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   And all the little arrows move on the set.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.600]   And when you're done, it'll do print quality,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.920]   you know, really high resolution quality versions of these
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.520]   for presentations and stuff like that.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.400]   It's just fun to lay stuff out in it.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.320]   And it's a very Mac app.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.240]   You know, it's built for the Mac.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.320]   It just feels good.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.120]   It comes with a lot of images and stuff like that.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.560]   It's just definitely worth checking out.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.880]   That's it.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.640]   Have I mentioned PodTube or did you guys mention PodTube?
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.080]   I think we did.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:36.560]   Okay.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.360]   I love PodTube.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   I love that.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.720]   And that and TubeSock, I think.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.720]   Yeah, we talked about that last couple of weeks.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.040]   Okay.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.880]   But they're worth mentioning because they're so fun.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.000]   I've been playing with them.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And it's just a way to get stuff off YouTube.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.680]   I was just using it today.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:48.720]   Five or six times.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.640]   I'd love to be able to automate that to tell you the truth.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.080]   I mean, in the same way, like you can here,
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.360]   once again, I bring up democracy.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.120]   It would be so great to be able to point that at a feed
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.240]   and have them automatically rip all the daily shoes to.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.920]   Or every lovely girl, 15.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.120]   You just have them all so you'd never have to worry about what's happened to be.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.960]   Never have to worry.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.920]   I will say something about parallels because I'm a big fan of parallels.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.720]   Running Windows on the Mac with parallels just is great.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.200]   And I have to say that Windows RC, Vista RC 2, came out on Friday,
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.040]   immediately worked out of the box with parallels.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.080]   I was able to install it.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.120]   So boy, a big thumbs up for the folks at parallels who have upgraded it now to
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.360]   work with the Mac Pro and unlimited memory.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.320]   And it works great with Vista, which is pretty cool.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.080]   If you want to try, Vista has been a free download of the beta.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.640]   And if you want to just see what it's like as a Mac user,
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.560]   if you've got two gigs of RAM or more and you've got a powerful enough machine,
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.600]   it's pretty amazing.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.560]   Does it give you free viruses too?
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.760]   Yeah, viruses are free.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.400]   Everything that's--
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.600]   You know what to charge?
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.480]   Adwares free.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.280]   All comes with it.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   I can't wait.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.960]   You sound like a Mac big at Scott Born.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:57.360]   I am.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.160]   I can't help it.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:58.720]   I'm up.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.000]   You know, I just freaked out the first time I heard this whole notion of I know
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.440]   everybody loves it, but I am not putting the blue screen of death on my Mac.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:05.840]   No wait.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.440]   It's not like bootcamp where you really are installing it out of the Mac.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.040]   With parallels, it's just a file.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.560]   It's unobtrusive.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.480]   If you throw the file out, it's gone.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.280]   So it's really kind of a great way to use Windows without any commitment.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.520]   I have to say, though, the scariest thing about my bootcamp,
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:27.120]   and was when I did the 10-4-8 thing in my OS 10 wouldn't launch.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.480]   But you could run Windows.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.960]   No, it would automatically go, "I can't find the folder.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.760]   I can't find the folder."
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.960]   And then it would just jump into Windows.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.720]   And I was like, "No, I'm in Windows.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.960]   Whoa, you know, it's like all I can use on my Mac."
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.400]   It's like that outer limits with the librarian.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.360]   Actually, many people don't--
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.520]   All I wanted to do was read and then it ends up with broken glasses.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.920]   Many people don't realize that was the point of 10-4-8.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.760]   It was the new Windows upgrade to Mac.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.400]   It seems to work really well in your system.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.800]   It was actually mostly aperture Leo.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.920]   Was it really?
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.320]   Yeah, there was all those little things you had to do to
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.000]   eye-lives and all that stuff.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.360]   That was all the support aperture?
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.120]   That was all the support aperture.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.000]   What a waste of time.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.800]   I do want to say, if you're a Merlin man or a Getting Things Done fan,
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.360]   you've got to go to 43folders.com.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.840]   Because Merlin is--
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.280]   They're going to be more than just the one of these.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:22.160]   Interviews with Getting Things Done, Dave Allen and David Allen.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.000]   No, this is really exciting for me.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.880]   Thanks for mentioning that.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.960]   Yeah, it's a podcast series that we did together.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.920]   We went into a studio down in Ohio and recorded a couple hours of stuff.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.880]   Fantastic.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.080]   So we were rolling out through probably the next probably eight or so weeks.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:40.560]   Well, I'm a Getting Things Done fan of Red All, or at least both of David's books on Getting Things Done.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:46.640]   And I'm a big Merlin man fan, but of course I've learned a lot about GTD from 43folders,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   but it's great to see the two of you together.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.400]   You'll never believe that two grown men could talk so fast at the same time.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.520]   You're both getting a lot done.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.600]   43folders.com.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.560]   The first one is up right now on procrastination.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.320]   I'll get it tomorrow.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.560]   And also, I got a couple of front cells.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.760]   Just Macbreak, the regular video version, will be doing another
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.640]   automator session with a sound later this week.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.320]   So it's definitely worth checking out.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:14.880]   And don't get--
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.920]   You see automator with your eyesight.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.440]   Don't get scared if you go to Macbreak.com and all of a sudden you see "Twit."
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.320]   [laughter]
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.320]   That means it's intentional.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.440]   That means it's just an ass-it-awing thing.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.760]   And I'm scared of me, to be honest with you.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:26.960]   That's my--
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   That's my--
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.160]   I know we planned it, but I didn't--
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.720]   So essentially, we're taking down the Macbreak site and everything.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.600]   Yeah, we're just getting everything into "Twit."
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.920]   And at some point, Scott, you and I will coordinate on getting iLifeZone moved over as well.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.960]   That's right.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:49.920]   For now, iLifeZone.com and eventually, Twit.tv and all 32,000 of my lowly listeners can't wait.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.320]   Can I keep my domain name for now, Don Leo?
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.960]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.320]   [laughter]
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.760]   Anything must come to me.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.840]   Yes, you can, Merlin.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.480]   Absolutely.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.600]   But there will be a time.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.800]   And maybe that time will never come.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.640]   When you will come to me and say, "Mr. Colleon, I need a favor."
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.080]   I'll make for you, my God, right?
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.880]   Beautiful cake.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.240]   I'll make for you a favor.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.400]   Time may never come, Merlin.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.840]   So now we can say, if I plugged everything, podcastingtricks.com,
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:26.000]   43folders.com, pixelcore.com, twit.tv, and next Tuesday, another Mac break weekly,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.360]   a Mac break coming up this week.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.560]   Say again, what subject?
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.360]   We're going to talk about it.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.720]   We got, and we got, now, South's going and talking about using Automator and your
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.520]   eyesight.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.320]   So it should be, yeah.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:34.560]   It should be.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.440]   Was I there for that?
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   You were.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.400]   Okay, you did it with him.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.160]   I'm going to watch it because I don't remember a thing.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.920]   So it'll be great.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.680]   It's one nice thing about having a bad memory.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.480]   It's always new to me.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.720]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.000]   We'll see.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.520]   We need to close out for this.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.840]   Look what they do to my boy.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.520]   You look like a good boy.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.080]   Okay, that's good enough.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:56.880]   I'll see you next time.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.680]   See you next time.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:14.880]   [Music]
