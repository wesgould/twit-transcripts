[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Also around the table Merlin Man of 43Folders.com.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And Chris Breen is here from the Mac.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   He's the Mac Daddy from Mac 9-1-1 at Mac World Magazine.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Hey, Chris.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I'm doing well.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Thanks.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   How's the hair?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The hair is great.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I understand Merlin used your hair in a presentation.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Yeah, yeah, he did.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   But I've updated the hair now.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It has been dethatched.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You have to do that every few years so the oxygen can actually get to the roots I understand.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Actually, with my hair it's every three months.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yeah, Ron, apart as if you trim it, it actually grows faster.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yeah, I do it soon.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   There's a guy who comes around with a little hole poker, right?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   He pulls in the thatch just to let it out and breathe.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.600]   Well, it's like one of those lawn aerators.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.000]   You know, where you sort of stand on it and then, you know, jump up and down on it and
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   you get those little cores that come out.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Yeah, and that's my skill.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.280]   That's pleasant.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.000]   You could probably mind that and sell it to people, hairless people.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.800]   Well, I have done that, but I'm kind of working on it in fourth world countries before I release
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   it here.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.160]   Hair will just hair plugs to the poor.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   I think that's correct.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   Yeah, doctors.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.960]   It'd be frontier song.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   Hair plugs.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Red sancin.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.240]   Green plugs, green plugs, San Frontier.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   There you go.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   That's it.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   I think we found it.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.080]   I think we found Chris's new.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   Meche.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.400]   We're going to do the whole show in French now.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.840]   We may be on sewer.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.560]   I think that was it.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.640]   That was our French.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.840]   Let's see this week.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240]   Any news at all?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   Anything?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   Nothing.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   Yes.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.040]   Oh, there have been there have been new things.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.280]   There have been new things.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.640]   I've heard of new things.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.920]   Number one is, this is more on the tech end, but Apple has released the new X-an.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   So that's people that have been...
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.360]   I don't know if we should lead with that exactly.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.640]   Well, I mean, it was new.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   It was new.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   You were saying was there any new?
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   That's new in the Mac world.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.920]   Hey, they're not going to NAB.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.720]   Is that a big deal?
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   You know, I don't really think it is.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.360]   I think that, you know, I have to say that you have to look at the cost of NAB.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.240]   I think a lot of people get concerned about this...
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.960]   Apple's not going to be at NAB.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.000]   Avid, by the way, is also not going to be at NAB.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   And one of the things that you have to understand is that the cost is, you know, in the millions
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   of dollars.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   When you look at the size of their booth, you just went...
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.120]   I think we were through the show.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   I mean, a little booth.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.440]   We had a booth that was only 20 by 10 and it, you know, nearly broke us.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.480]   You know, and so the...
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.400]   This is a huge 100 by 100 booth or something like that.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   And it's...
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   And then you have to bring all those people in and put them up at NAB price, you know,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.800]   whatever the price is in Vegas to put, you know, 100 people up.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.480]   You also have all the union costs of putting up the actual booth, all the, you know, shipping,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   everything else.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   You're talking about millions of dollars.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.400]   You're talking about probably something that rivals the engineering costs of the Pro Apps,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   which are going to be promoted there.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Really?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   For a year.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   Wow.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   I mean, it's just...
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   Yeah, it's that much.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.440]   It really is numbers like that, you know, and I don't know exactly what either number is,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.720]   but my guess is that it's not...
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.760]   They're pretty close to each other.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.080]   And so I'd rather see more features myself.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   You know, I think that...
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.880]   Yeah, absolutely sure.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.040]   The other thing is if you took all the money...
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.440]   And I'm not saying Apple's going to do this, but we had this discussion when Avid dropped
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.920]   out is that if you took all the money that Apple saves by not going to NAB, they could
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.040]   do a road show and spend $50,000 to $100,000 per city in all the major cities in the United
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   States and still come out even and have a far bigger impact on their actual market
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.080]   than they will or in a far better return than anything they're going to do on the floor
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   of NAB.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.880]   It's really though an indictment of NAB more than it is.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.880]   I mean, you got a market.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.280]   I mean, you could say the same thing.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.360]   Well, if Apple didn't buy any ads, they could put more money into the leopard, but you need
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   to market.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.200]   I think it's an indictment on conventions.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   Yes.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.000]   I don't think it's necessarily...
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You just really have to have something, a convention.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.960]   The reason we see, I think, so many things about the iPod, for instance, at Macworld,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.400]   is because that pays off because you have a lot of people, it's a cheap product, and
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   you can just buy it real quick.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   You know...
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.760]   You don't want people who are oppressed people who are going to come in and write about it,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.680]   so there's an economy of scale to getting all those people in one place.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   It matters.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   I mean, these things matter.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   If you're in a business that has a huge amount of networking that's very costly and
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.960]   you're all going to be in Las Vegas at the same time, I think that's when one reason
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.560]   conferences succeed is because a lot of powerful people agree to be in the same place at the
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   same time.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.720]   Well, NAB is that for broadcasting, for sure.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.280]   And I'm sure it's a networking opportunity for people who are talented.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   Well, TV...
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   It's more engineers.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.880]   TV and radio engineers, that's what...
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   I tell you to wait.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yep, an opportunity, but you have to ask yourself, "Is there other ways to do the networking?"
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   You know, for instance, I mean, I don't know how you would do this in the technology area,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.440]   but when I went to TED Global, you know, now, there is a...
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.920]   That's an event that is designed for networking.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.240]   It's designed for everyone to meet everyone else.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.720]   And you know, it's far more efficient.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.400]   I met more people in more countries than I had ever in my entire life.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.600]   And everyone's there to network.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.440]   They know that they're there to talk to each other.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   They're there to find out about what the other ones are doing.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.240]   And the question is, this is all grew.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.880]   I mean, you know, this all grew from little tables to these huge one-upmanship.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   And I think a lot of the folks at the top of that one-upmanship are starting to go,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   you know, this is getting out of hand.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.080]   Interesting.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.840]   My concern about this whole NAB thing is that the reason that Apple claims it's doing this,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   and it's...
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.720]   This is sort of a meme that they've been putting out for a long time now, is that they say,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.840]   "You know, we don't need to do conventions because we've got a convention every single
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.600]   day at the Apple Store and everybody can come by and see our stuff."
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.280]   And they've been floating this around for a while.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.640]   So, okay, fine, they're pulling this RNAB.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.560]   We're not going to go to NAB because you can see it's at our Apple stores.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.720]   And of course, you can't get that kind of experience there, but that's what they're
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.960]   floating around.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.720]   So how far will they take this?
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.760]   Will they eventually say, "You know, we don't need to do Expo because we can call an event
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.840]   when we need something to happen and everybody's going to come because you do."
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.560]   That's what you guys do.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.000]   And you can go to the Apple Store for what you're supposed to do.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.920]   I think it's the one thing you keep, though.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.040]   I would think so.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.000]   But it does make me a little nervous when they kind of keep saying, "We have Expos every
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.480]   day at our Apple Store."
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.600]   This is a trend that this industry has been watching for years because my main, if you
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.760]   call it a job in the '90s, was making websites for things like PC Expo and stuff like that.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.160]   And even then, they were incredibly nervous about online anything.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.320]   I mean, obviously they wouldn't have a website up for marketing reasons, but they were very
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.520]   concerned even then of what the internet did to the whole idea of both the Expo and the
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520]   conference.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.040]   And I think that's, you take that, which I think is a very real concern.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.920]   It was then, and it's even more real now.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.080]   And then you add to that, I think the very important discussion that people are having
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   about the environmental impact of a conference.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.960]   I mean, I'm not a tree hugger, but man, you think about all the crap.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.440]   I mean, just think about all the people who fly into that, all the resources that go into
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   that.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.040]   I mean, let alone all the brochures that get thrown away and the swag bags that people
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.240]   leave in their hotel room.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.520]   I mean, there's just something that, you know, part of what makes the internet the internet
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.360]   is the economy is our phrase, economy is scale.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.480]   There's something extremely efficient about being able to get that information out over
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   the internet.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.600]   And then second, in a very kind of George Bush administration way, to Chris' point, you
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.800]   get to control the message when it's your event.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.680]   When you go out there and you, you know, you really...
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.320]   Your role is their event though, right?
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   I mean, they don't...
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   But see, I...
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   That's why you keep Macworld.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:42.400]   But I mean, you know, if Apple goes away from Mac Expo, I mean, I don't know.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.040]   I mean, that's hard to imagine how you could have much of a show without them there, don't
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   you think?
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.040]   Oh, yeah, you don't have that.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   Just because they'd draw...
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.120]   Ah, Steve Note alone draws so much of the attention to that event.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.120]   No, that would be much...
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.760]   Yeah, you just think of Boston and what happened there would Apple hold up.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.320]   Yeah, boom, gone.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.920]   I think it'd be highly unlikely that Apple would drop out of Macworld.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.320]   I think that that's the one...
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   I think it does benefit them.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320]   It benefits them by that...
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.960]   It's just such an old-fashioned event.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.960]   It's such a weirdly like 1970s way to conduct business, to have an event like that.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   I mean, just the...
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.080]   Just if you think about how many thousands of people flew on a plane to go stand in
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   a room so they could watch someone talk, it's...
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.240]   On the other hand, you look at conferences like South by Southwest and they're thriving.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.240]   Well, it's because people drink.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.520]   I mean, I think the difference is conference versus Expo, that when it is about people
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.960]   getting together and conferring...
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   Yes.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   And I'll tell you the same thing.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.360]   I'll tell you the same thing, which is that everything...
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   And this is true for me.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   I mean, with the possible exception of ETEC back in the day.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.120]   That's the arriving emergency...
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   Which is a little bit...
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.680]   It's gotten a little bit, you know, biz dev over the years.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.200]   But man, when ETEC first came out, like every panel I went to, everything was great.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.880]   But anyway, all conferences, it's all about the hallways.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.920]   Everybody knows that.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   And so it's just really...
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.920]   Even at the time of the day, I've been driving.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.800]   It's a glass to put the water in, you know, to have a conference.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.400]   I totally agree with you.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.640]   Well, maybe there'll be Mac World conferences at a Mac World Expo.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.760]   And I mean, certainly they already have that with WWDC and they're never going to stop
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.960]   doing that either, are they?
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   What's that?
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.920]   Marketer Steve Rubell pointed out that Apple has been on Twitter.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.060]   Apple has been releasing something new every Tuesday.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.760]   He says it's gone on for 52 weeks.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.400]   I don't know if he's counting or being facetious.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.340]   And I don't know if it has anything to do with the Mac break weekly release date.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.760]   But I just keep waiting for Apple to call.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   I'm going to turn on the ringer.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   They did call right after the show last week.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760]   Did you know that?
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.080]   I said a note out.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.480]   They called and they said, "Do you want to see the MacBook Air?"
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.160]   I don't know if they're listening or what.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.520]   So I have an air in my hand.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   I still...
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   I have an air in my hand too.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.160]   No, I'm not working blue, Leo.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   I've got an actual...
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   Got an air.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   You did.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   It review air.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   Did you buy one?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   It was given to you.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   That's what I thought.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.380]   It's absolutely extraordinary.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.420]   You know, there's a lot to be said about it.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.380]   I still wouldn't probably recommend it.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.100]   It's one of those things that if you don't know you want one, don't get one.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.580]   I've never had such...
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.060]   I don't think I've ever had such conflicting feelings about a computer.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.780]   I mean, as much as I kind of rag the whole iPhone buzz thing, I've never disputed it.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.700]   I don't think that the iPhone that you hold in your hand is anything but like an amazing
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.300]   piece of work for the ages.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.700]   This thing is like, "Man, you talk about trade-offs.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.300]   This would actually be a good topic probably at some point."
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.940]   But you talk about trade-offs.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.940]   Man.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.940]   You give up a lot.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.620]   Well, you totally give up a lot.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.780]   I mean, like trying to migrate through the air.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.060]   I mean, I finally got smart and plugged in a direct ethernet cable between the two boxes.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.060]   But wow.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.700]   Man, once you're set up, it's looking into stuff.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.140]   I guess once you're set up, I'm sure it'll be fine.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.980]   But it's all about the trade-offs.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.540]   And I don't know.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.100]   I can see like 80% of people who have held it going, "Okay.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.580]   This is a piece of industrial design like I have never seen."
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.260]   And I could still see 20% of people going, "You've got to be kidding me.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.780]   This is like the biggest joke ever."
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:01.140]   I think the weird thing for me is it doesn't feel like there's a computer anywhere in there.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:07.940]   If you open a clipboard and started typing on it, it's a monitor with a latch.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.540]   The computer must be somewhere in the fourth dimension.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.900]   And that's the strangest thing.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:19.220]   And I think it is going to, in this regard, this is a significant product because you're
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.420]   kind of seeing the future here where the computer kind of goes away.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.420]   I mean, Apple's been trying that with the iMac, but as miniaturization gets better and
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.220]   better, where's the computer?
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.820]   There's no computer here.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.380]   It's barely thick enough for the keyboard and a screen.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.100]   It's a strange feeling, especially when you're computing in your lap.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.100]   I agree.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   I agree because it's barely there at all.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.140]   I mean, I've talked to Ad nauseam about my wife's, the 12-inch power book she's got
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.140]   that I adore.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.860]   And this thing, I threw it on a scale this morning, and according to the Arkichten scale,
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.100]   it was two pounds, 15.8 ounces.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.780]   Which again, you cannot underscore this enough.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.700]   We say this about every Apple product, but invariably it becomes truer with every Apple
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.700]   product.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.500]   You can't even get this until you actually hold it in your hand.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.300]   I guess Chris can probably underscore this.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.860]   Chris, you've played with one, right, Chris?
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.620]   Yeah, I have.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.900]   And I feel there are too many trade-offs for me to run out and purchase one.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.900]   But you're right.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.700]   I picked one up and went, "Huh, wow, this is beautiful."
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.980]   And you just sort of want to stroke it and open it up and go, "Wow!"
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.980]   But when I sort of step away and I give myself about three days to walk away from it and
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.700]   just think about it, I really just can't justify buying one because I need much more
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.900]   for my laptop.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.180]   I keep thinking, "Oh, I really want to buy this."
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.180]   But exactly that.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.260]   And then I look at the MacBook, which I bought in lieu of it.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.900]   And it's got all this storage and it's got a DVD burner.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.540]   And the screen, you know, compare the size of the screen and the keyboard, they're almost
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.540]   identical.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   I mean, I don't think there's that much difference.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.820]   The LED screen does not knock me out to the point where I'd say I have to have that.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.540]   It's really about the thinness, the lightness.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.220]   And the MacBook is, it's what?
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.220]   It's two pounds heavier.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.220]   Come on.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.220]   Yeah, two pounds.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   No, totally.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.540]   You know, obviously I risk kind of putting off the Apple True Believers here.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.740]   But I think something is true about a Mac buyer.
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.740]   And I've said this before.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.660]   But I really, people who buy Macs, at least in the past, and I think to an extent still
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.260]   now, are buying on a certain idea of quality and design and usability.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.660]   And they're willing to pay a little bit more for something that they think is exquisite,
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.660]   right?
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.220]   Like you can buy a watch, you know, out of a gumball machine that'll keep time.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.380]   But a lot of people want a watch that, well, you know, looks good and conveys status or
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.380]   what have you.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.780]   But I think the build quality on this thing is out of control.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.260]   Like if they had half-assed this, I would not be as excited as I am, right?
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.780]   If this thing did not feel, if it did not have the sense of being completely finished
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.900]   in terms of the design component, it would be no question.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.380]   It's useless, you know?
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.340]   It's just, but how amazing is it that a company could go and make something like this
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.500]   with this mini trade-offs at a point when they're competing with PC companies that are
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.020]   throwing as much power as they can to try and sell machines that they can go out and
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.100]   sell this exquisite object that's important.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.420]   Well, it's interesting because Lenovo is making an X300 that will also fit in a vanilla envelope,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.980]   as Walt Mossberg pointed out.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.540]   It doesn't have anywhere near the wow factor though.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.180]   It's thin.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.780]   But you know, and you're echoing something, David Hanamaya Hanson, the guy who created
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:24.380]   Ruby on Rails and works for 37 Signals, wrote this in his blog, and finish of this is dramatically
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.780]   higher even than other Macintosh's.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.180]   And I have to agree, when I look at my MacBook, it's a little, you know, the plastics, a
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.180]   little rattly.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.180]   You know, it's fine.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.180]   I can live with it.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.180]   My last one was like that too.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.860]   This thing is like a BMW.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.860]   I mean, it's...
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.980]   Did you see David Galbraith's post on MacBook Air?
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.300]   I'm trying to pull it up quickly, but he was, and I forget who this is, Viya.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.340]   I'm sure it's probably Gruber or that article.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.580]   He wrote a long article also.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.580]   He wrote a really good long article.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.580]   It was worth reading.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.260]   But he's talking here about how everybody's whining about it being underpowered, but then
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.420]   goes out and compares it to the original Rottentean.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.420]   Right.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.420]   And he says...
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.420]   I did.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.540]   There's 100 Pentium-based computers in an office the size of a hanger to equal the processing
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.820]   power of a single MacBook Air.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.580]   I don't have any way to check out.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.540]   Chris, even in Macworld's benchmarks, you point out that your base machine, which is
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.220]   a G4 power book, is much slower than the...
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.940]   Even though the air is the slowest Intel Mac out there.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.660]   And you know, it has so much to do with the way you compute.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.580]   And one reason I don't have it is because most of my resources aren't online.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.740]   If I were doing a bunch of stuff, a bunch of work over the internet, if I used to Google
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.300]   Docs or everything, it would make sense.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.260]   And maybe I'll get there in the next year or two.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.380]   But right now, I do everything locally and I need the kind of speed and power that I
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.860]   get from my MacBook Pro and not from this machine.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.060]   But that is going to change.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.340]   I think this is a terrible analogy probably.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.460]   But I mean, when I was a kid, we not only didn't have a color TV because TV was kind
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.580]   of frowned on in my house as much as you never know that to look at me today.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.180]   But we had a little crappy black and white TV.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.140]   How do you know all this pop culture crap then?
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.140]   Where you sneak in a TV?
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.140]   Oh, no.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.140]   I watched it.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.140]   I just got off.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.140]   My mom was at the court off every week or two.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   But I still saw every episode of Happy Days when we got on it.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.140]   I'm going to say, you seem to know a lot about the TV.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.820]   But think about it this way.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.780]   Think about like when did color TV, there was a great infographic on the New York Times
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.500]   in the last week or two showing the adoption rate of different technologies.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.020]   And talking about how, for example, a television, you look at how color TV had a pretty quick
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.020]   uptake from when it became incredibly expensive in what the early '60s to be coming.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.580]   It tipped pretty quickly.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:32.780]   But then think about how quickly you started to see TVs in different rooms at the house.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.980]   And I know this is an incredibly obvious example.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.820]   But like, yeah, sure, the one that's going to sit in your living room or today your media
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.340]   center, if you're a dork, is like, you're going to get the nicest TV you can afford
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.340]   if your family sits around and watches TV.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.980]   But you understand that if you want a TV that's going to be in your kitchen and not
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.780]   be cumbersome, it can't have the same form factor as the one you're living in.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.860]   That's kind of the opposite with the MacBook.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.740]   This is the one I put the areas of when I put it in the living room that I watch TV with.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.980]   Well, in that case, yeah, no.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   But you see my point.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.980]   No, it's exactly your point.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.460]   And the kitchen has the iMac.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.460]   Has the more...
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.060]   Nobody would ever go, oh, God, if I can't have a 30-inch screen in my kitchen, why would
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.380]   I even want to have a TV?
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.380]   Well, you understand.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.380]   There's a trade-off.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.260]   And I think that says this becomes more of a consumer device and it becomes something
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.260]   where, again, Apple users are probably willing to spend more money on stuff like this.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.820]   For me, this is totally going to be like a living room, bedroom, computer.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.660]   It's not going to be what I like to work on.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.420]   I think we all agree then, basically, that this is a remarkable computer.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.420]   There are trade-offs.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.140]   And we wouldn't say go out and get it to anybody.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.860]   But if somebody can see it, the value of it, it's a worthwhile thing to get.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.060]   Look, let me ask you this.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.060]   It's not too low.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.060]   It doesn't feel slow.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.060]   It's very...
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.060]   It's very...
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.060]   It's very...
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   It's happy.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.060]   Totally happy.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.060]   Let me ask you this.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.060]   Here's what I was thinking about.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.260]   As I sat there watching 16 hours and some minutes as my estimated migration time on air.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.260]   What...
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.260]   Yeah, nice.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.460]   First of all, also, I did like...
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.380]   I guess it was Jason Snell.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.580]   Like Jason, I went in and did a huge amount of house cleaning before I did this.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.860]   But my question to you is, would you recommend a MacBook Air to somebody who's switching?
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.860]   No.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.860]   Absolutely not.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.860]   I'd recommend a MacBook.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.460]   What do you think, Chris?
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.460]   No, I agree.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.460]   I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.260]   I think people would find too many obstacles and they'd say, "Oh, if this is what the Mac
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.660]   experience is like, forget it."
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   I'd say MacBook.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   I'd say MacBook.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.660]   It would be easy.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.460]   MacBook is a no brainer.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.460]   This is a second computer.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.820]   I don't think this would ever be a first computer unless you're an executive, unless you're
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.580]   somebody who is in a computer person.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.980]   I think if you're not using graphics, if you're not doing anything heavy, I mean, I think
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:37.340]   that when I look at my wife mostly, you're spending time in Excel and Word and those types
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.740]   of things.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.260]   And for her, it would be nice and small.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.100]   It's something she can just put in a pack and it's perfect for because she never...
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.340]   I mean, I looked at her.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.660]   She was asking how to migrate her files this morning and how to move her files from one
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.660]   computer to another.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.220]   We're looking to get in a new one.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.900]   All of her files that she's accumulated over the last, except for music and movies that
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.260]   she's downloaded on iTunes, all of her files that she's accumulated are like 365 megabytes.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.300]   We just put that on the flash drive.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.740]   For a person that's doing that kind of stuff, they're surfing the web, they're using email,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.420]   they're writing stuff, they're doing Excel files or whatever.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.540]   I think this is a perfect machine.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.900]   It's not taking any extra data that you...
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.740]   Any extra room, more room than it has to.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.180]   It looks cool.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.700]   And it is very, very functional.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.700]   It's very fast.
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.700]   You can do all the little entertainment things as well.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.180]   I couldn't use it because I can't...
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.500]   You can't add a video on it and you can't do photo...
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.980]   You could do Photoshop.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.180]   Although, actually, I actually talked to...
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.460]   There's a expert member, John Flowers, who was in...
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.740]   He bought one for himself and his girlfriend.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.980]   He said he's editing fine on his air.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.180]   Final Cut's going to run.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.980]   A lot of this stuff, especially when you're just doing editing.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.980]   Motion is the thing that's going to really bog down, but Final Cut actually is not very
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.620]   graphics intensive.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.740]   It's not really putting a lot of push on the processor.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.900]   Actually, he's editing just fine.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.060]   Now, I'm sure that he's working on smaller files than what we do.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.460]   I think that there's...
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:19.460]   I think that for a lot of people, I know that I'd love to have one as a second computer
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.860]   or as a travel computer that I'm just going to go somewhere for the day or two or three
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.420]   or whatever and I don't really need to do any heavy processing.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.060]   It's so when you pick it up and hold it and move it around, it's...
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.900]   I wish I could do the work on this one.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.980]   I would buy the drive.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.980]   I would buy the drive.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.980]   I mean, I wouldn't try to be doing it.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   I wouldn't buy...
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.980]   You mean the SS2?
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.260]   Oh, the external drive.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.260]   External drive.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.260]   I just buy the drive.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.260]   I mean, people complain about the drive.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.260]   I'm just like, "I just buy the drive."
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.540]   You know, I have a cheap third-party USB CD.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.260]   I haven't tried it or DVD player.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260]   I haven't tried it yet, but I imagine it would work.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.380]   Chris, did they test that in the lab at all?
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.820]   They tested the drive that you purchased for it and it doesn't work with others.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.420]   Oh.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.180]   So I won't be able to use that third-party drive.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.880]   Well, no, you may be able to use the third-party drive with it, but if you purchase
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.580]   the Apple drive, it doesn't work with other computers.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:17.700]   Yeah, because it requires a certain amount of extra in the power department.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.340]   Really?
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.700]   I believe that's the case.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.700]   How interesting.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.900]   If you get a call from Apple after this thing...
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.900]   No, he's wrong.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.900]   It works the other way.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   Then, no, no.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900]   I don't have any.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.900]   I think it's safe to assume with almost anything with this box that like, your expectations
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.260]   need to be part of owning this thing as I'm realizing.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.260]   For example, like I was excited.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.260]   I was like, "Oh, great.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.260]   I'm going to have another mag...
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.260]   Another mag safe."
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.720]   Because I used several mags safe so I can move around the house without having to worry
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   about it.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   I was like, "Oh, this is going to be awesome.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   I'll be able to use the magsic."
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   No, no.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.480]   It's got its own different wattage mags safe.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   It's like everything about this is a total of...
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.480]   Oh, the connector is enormous.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.480]   No.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.560]   It's different wattage, but you can fit the other one in it.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.960]   I don't know what's going to happen, but I was...
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.320]   You can't connect in that little tiny thing.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   Wow.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.480]   That thing was out super easy in my experience.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:06.640]   I didn't try the Air's connector on my other computers, but I was able to charge the
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   Air.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.200]   Apple's probably also going to give me a ring on this with the power supply from the MacBook
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   Pro.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.060]   As soon as we're done, they're going to announce that you just voided your warranty.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.060]   I didn't buy it.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.620]   I just gone back in three weeks.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.540]   It's a small power supply.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.700]   It's the little one, 65 watt.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.500]   By the way, I have to say this is that if there is one big negative, it is the length
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.780]   of time it takes to charge it and the sad battery life it seems to give.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.780]   Oh, really?
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.620]   It's about four hours.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:40.060]   Why they say five when they know perfectly well it's not five.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.060]   It's not just Apple.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.260]   Every company in the world does this.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.260]   I wish they would just come up with one lie that everybody agreed on.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.340]   If everybody could just say, "Here is the time that you can expect doing something
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.940]   normal plus 20 percent," that would be fine.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.860]   As long as we all knew how much to discount.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.860]   It's just that...
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.020]   It's never in the amount of time though, is it?
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.620]   Does anybody get five hours?
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.620]   No.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.780]   I really think they must be getting this.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.260]   I think Macworld actually has joked about this before, but I think they derived this time
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.780]   by basically opening a file with nothing running and then seeing how long it takes till the
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.780]   battery dies.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:17.220]   Turn off airport, turn off Bluetooth, turn off every possible power drain and then don't
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.580]   touch it whatever you do.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.260]   Leo, how many times have you charged and discharged?
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.260]   Two or three.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.860]   Yeah, because apparently the first charge is not good and then it gets better over time.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.540]   In terms of how long it takes?
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.260]   The first charge can take like eight hours.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.260]   It did.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.260]   It took a really long time.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   Yeah, yeah, but it gets better.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.260]   It gets better.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.260]   Okay.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.260]   The battery softens up.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.260]   Exactly.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.220]   It's got to be massaged and now it's all retracted.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.700]   If it got five hours, I think that would be pretty compelling.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.500]   It's saying four right now, fully charged, but I know it really is more like three and
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.500]   a half.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   With laptops, that's the case.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.500]   With iPods, it's not.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.500]   Right.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.500]   Is the battery removable?
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   No.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.500]   It's embedded right.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.220]   Although somebody told me that even though there's 12 screws to open this thing up, once
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.260]   you open it up, it actually is fairly, it's fairly easy to get around inside.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.900]   It's not like a MacBook where everything goes boing.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.460]   You can't better get back together.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.460]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.860]   I really don't want to talk about that.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.860]   Boing.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.620]   You realize how tight the tolerances on the engineering are when you try to take anything
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.620]   by Apple Park.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.620]   Well, it's like when I was a kid and I would take apart watches, you know, and you never
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   get back together.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.300]   There's always one big spring that you don't know where you say.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.660]   Everything's in there, but there's a spring lift over.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.340]   I can't understand.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.620]   Just for the second hand, who needs that?
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.300]   So it turns out Mac owners are in fact snobs.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.420]   Now this is according to a study.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.060]   Is that a surprise?
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.380]   It's according to a study by mindset media that I am not going to buy because it's like
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.380]   $400.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.060]   I'm really, I really want to buy it.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:26:00.260]   You know, this one of those companies that gives advertisers research as to the psychograstic
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.380]   ethics of a target market and they did it on Apple owners.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.980]   Fortunately, the street website made a video based on the contents of it.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.620]   And if I can explain, if I may extract from the video, Mac owners are more likely to be
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:21.500]   perfectionists to use notebooks, to use teeth whitening products.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   Show of hands.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.100]   How many of you have used teeth whitening products?
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.340]   I look like a Dickens character.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.340]   I know.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   I know.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340]   Look how I'm snaggle tooth man.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   I use a hair whitening.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.340]   I'll back up.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.340]   I Colgate.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.340]   Colgate whitening strips.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.340]   You use those?
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.340]   I'm saying Mac break.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.340]   We should be.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:41.020]   In fact, that's the point of studies like this is now is absolutely Colgate's looking
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.900]   at this and saying, hmm, we need to find some venue where we could reach where could
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.140]   we advertise inexpensively to reach a large number of Macintosh owners.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.420]   Where can we go to find somebody with extra money who doesn't care about their personal
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.420]   appearance?
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.820]   Mac, we found your thing.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.100]   Mac owners are also more likely to drive station wagons to pay for downloaded music.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.300]   Yeah, because they use iTunes to go to Starbucks.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.780]   Yeah, because they use iTunes to care about green products in the environment.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.340]   Well, yeah.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.820]   To own a hybrid car.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.980]   How many Priuses in the audience here today?
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.180]   Oh, you guys own cars?
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.180]   Mm.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.740]   You're a small side branch of the Macintosh.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.700]   Well, actually, I have an oak tree that fell naturally that I put some wheels on.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.580]   And I do a Flintstone style method of locomotion that requires actually no car and credits
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   at all.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.580]   I have to use car.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.020]   I rent for a short period of time.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.020]   That's right.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.020]   You don't own a car.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.420]   That's right.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.660]   And last but not least, and I don't know where they got this, Mac owners tend to buy five
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.540]   or more pairs of sneakers a year.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.220]   Whoa.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.220]   That's a lot of sneakers.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.220]   That sounds made up.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.220]   That sounds made up to me.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.260]   No, you know that that comes from and you guys wouldn't know about this.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.220]   People who run on purpose.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.660]   Right.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.660]   Not from the law.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.460]   You mean, you mean not not just from bullies?
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.820]   Not for not from bullies, not for a streetcar, but people who run for exercise.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.820]   Go for shoes.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.180]   I just I had not heard of that.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.460]   That is new to me.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.460]   I was eating Cheetos.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.340]   I don't think that's on the list.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.180]   Back many Mac users are also incredibly distracted and enjoy a snack.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.940]   Now my air is all orange.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.740]   So I don't know what to say about this.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.740]   We are snobs.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.740]   I think that this is obvious.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.300]   Do you think this is changing though?
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.220]   I mean, like if you're like me and you made it through the hard days when it really did
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:46.380]   kind of suck to be a Mac user, I wonder I have to ask myself sometimes how much baggage
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.140]   I carry around about that stuff and really looking at how many people are using some
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.140]   kind of Apple product.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.180]   Do you think that kind of stuff holds up?
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.740]   I think it's less true.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.540]   But remember, we're still a small percentage.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.260]   We're not even in double digits of the overall computer market.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.020]   So we're still it's still a minority.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.860]   But I mean, it's like trying to compare like I don't know how do you say I was like trying
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:12.300]   to compare like the entire behavior of the cop population of the United States to people
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.220]   who like John Claude Van Dam movies.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.580]   I mean, it's not even how can you even make a comparison.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.820]   Well, if you're an advertiser, you care.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.980]   Yeah, I suppose it just sounds like something that sounds like BS.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.340]   Yeah, maybe I remember we're not including iPods in here.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   This is Mac owners.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.340]   Okay.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.340]   All right.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.340]   I'd like to throw this out to the panel now.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.020]   How often when you meet somebody who really doesn't know what you do and you tell them,
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.940]   yeah, I'm a Mac user and I do such and such in the business.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.180]   And these are people that are PC users.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:44.540]   You immediately see sort of a flinch reaction from them like you're about to give them
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.660]   the schmeal and give them a pamphlet.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.620]   I get I get the reaction like I tell them I'm working at Amnesty International or something
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.260]   because they always go, oh, yeah, I should I should do that.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.260]   That's it.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.260]   Yes.
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.260]   Yes.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.260]   Yes.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.260]   It's like, oh, man, I would love, you know, actually my mother has some back and I love
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.260]   it.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.580]   But, you know, I got to use a PC at work and I don't know it'd be such a pain.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.380]   Because they know that you're just about to hit them up.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.380]   They're trying to put you off.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.380]   Like ask, they are.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.540]   No, no, no, no, please don't start to feel.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.820]   Yes, I'll go to church more often.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.100]   I swear they're like meeting that it's like meeting the minister.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.100]   Same way.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.100]   Like rock, wall, ball supporters or something.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   Rock, wall.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.100]   Or for that matter, I find.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.100]   I find it.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.180]   What I find interesting is the camaraderie with other Mac users.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.460]   I mean, if I'm sitting at an airport, the person that's going to come and talk to me
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.460]   is another Mac user.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.900]   You know, they're going to be, you know, hey, man, can I, you know, and they'll ask me
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.340]   something about my Mac or whether I like the new like they'll assume that I know
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:45.380]   the new, whatever the new news is, you know, and talk about it, you know, much more readily.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:50.420]   I mean, no one ever talks to me who uses a PC like at an airport or a cafe or whatever.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   But everyone's got a question.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.900]   Oh, I can't figure this out.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.860]   And there's this kind of this thing.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.660]   And I find myself interested.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.060]   You know, like if I'm going to ask someone for directions or ask someone something at
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.180]   a coffee shop, I'm much more likely to walk up to someone that's kind of in the club.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.860]   And it's, but I find it just kind of an interesting psychological process.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:15.220]   I'm sure some sociologist or anthropologist has done a study on group identification
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.580]   memes and that this is just like that.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:22.100]   You know, you see somebody wearing, I don't know, a Puka shell necklace and you know,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   you know who they are.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.460]   You see somebody carrying a Mac, you know who they are.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.580]   You go on one of these Mac cruises.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.580]   It's really fun because it's a bunch of Mac people.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.020]   Well, I went, I was anxious to go get this thing because I knew it was sitting in South
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.020]   City.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.220]   So I went down there to pick it up at FedEx.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.500]   And I mean, I had an experience that I just can't imagine having happened a couple of
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.580]   years ago, which is I walk in and I give him my name.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.580]   He brings out a box.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.340]   He goes, Oh, hey, I don't think even saw the apple, whatever on it.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.940]   He goes, Hey, new laptop.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.940]   And I go, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   He goes, he goes, what kind?
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.940]   And I go, that's an apple.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.940]   He goes, Oh, new Mac book air.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.020]   It was like really, really pretty.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.100]   And I mean, like, okay, sure, maybe the guy's a Mac fan, but that would have never happened.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.380]   Like even a few years ago.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.380]   That's really funny.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.580]   I was like, wow, yeah.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.860]   I often wonder what the FedEx and the UPS guys think of, you know, my house since all this
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.660]   stuff is constantly arriving and shifts practically.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   It's worse at divorce.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.820]   I remember going to divorce.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.500]   There was literally a human sized tower of UPS boxes that had just been delivered.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.500]   Unbelievable.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.500]   Well, okay.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.740]   So we're going to cop to this.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.740]   We're perfectionists.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.900]   We're snobs.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.900]   We use teeth.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:31.380]   We use products, some of us, we go to Starbucks, we care about green, many of us own hybrid
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.020]   cars.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.260]   How many sneakers a year you go through?
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.980]   So basically you're saying we're insufferable.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.260]   Well, you know, if you think about it, isn't that Justin Long's character?
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.460]   He seems pretty mellow.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.460]   He's a perfectionist.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.460]   He has white teeth.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460]   I bet he drives a Prius.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.460]   Totally.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.460]   Of course he does.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.220]   And he was worried about sneakers.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.420]   The segue that was rides is that how does that score environmentally?
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   That's got to be pretty high.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.420]   Sure.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.420]   Sure, sure.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.340]   Well, you know, I mean, come on, you plug it in.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.780]   And we all know electric power is clean.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.540]   That's clean coal made with clean coal.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   Let's see.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.540]   What else?
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.540]   I know there were some other stories.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.540]   There's some other big stories.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.740]   The new shuffle is 49.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.740]   49 buckaroos.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:19.380]   Now, is this a different shuffle or is it?
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.740]   You just lowered the price.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.740]   No, there's no.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.180]   They had the added age.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:29.860]   Two gig is $69 and the one gig is $49.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.060]   That's really smart.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.940]   But now I really miss the USB connector because I'd love to have that back to say that's a
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   key drive too.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.940]   You can't.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.660]   But you start to carry the docks.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.660]   You can't do it.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.660]   Trade offs.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.660]   Yeah, trade offs.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.900]   Yeah, it's it is an amazing thing when you look at the what what Apple's done with is
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.100]   there is no air in that market.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   I mean, it's from the time you want to spend nothing.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.700]   $9 all the way up to $100.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.780]   Well, and they're smart because that's probably a lot closer to their actual cost.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.780]   I mean, come on.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   Right.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   These things are cheap.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.340]   It's a little it's a little piece of metal.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.340]   All right.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.340]   There's not much memory in it.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.340]   It's a gig.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.340]   Apple TV.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.340]   Apple TV.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.340]   People are starting to know.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.340]   Sorry.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.580]   People are starting to line up for the Apple TV.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.580]   The 160 gig.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.580]   I hear a lot of my friends who didn't buy Apple TV buying them.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.780]   Clearly, that product is now got some life in it.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.740]   Thanks to Apple TV to we still love it.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   We still happy?
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.740]   Yeah, I still want to I want to come back at not now necessarily, but I want to round
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:36.020]   back around to this whole rental 24 hour issue because I've rented three movies and I have
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.500]   not been able to finish any of them.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.020]   That's really annoying.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.820]   It's really, really annoying.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.540]   Even you know, even 36 hours would be just plain stupid.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.380]   I mean, 72 hours would be what they should do.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.060]   You just got to watch the damn thing though.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.860]   You're like, "Well, you don't want to come back whenever you want."
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.860]   Right.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.700]   As long as you pause it, but then you can't do anything else.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.700]   Right.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.700]   Right.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.700]   I like the end girls.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:06.220]   I have to admit I was going to rent sunshine and like two days ago and I looked at it and
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.980]   literally thought, "Am I really going to finish this tonight?"
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.700]   And I wasn't sure whether I was going to finish it tonight.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.500]   And I just didn't rent it.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   I just love you.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.100]   I'm in the hotel room and I'm looking at the $13 lousy image movie on my hotel and I'm
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.580]   looking and I'm thinking, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.140]   I can rent a movie on iTunes."
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.100]   And I did for four bucks.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.540]   And I watched it within 24 hours.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.180]   I mean, that's, you know, if you're in a hotel, that's a pretty good thing.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.180]   That's a lot cheaper.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.180]   I think it works.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.660]   I just think it would work a lot better at 72 hours.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.660]   That's all I mean.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.660]   I just think it would be much.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.660]   I mean, I'd be renting like a crazy man.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.180]   We know right now what you're listening to.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.820]   We know that Apple listens because they fixed the stack and they fixed the menu bar in leopard.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.900]   So I think we could count on them to fix that.
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:00.060]   Do you think it's enough that we've heard from you, Chris Breen, since maybe we have,
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.500]   since you had time to play with this thing?
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.060]   Now I don't think we have.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.220]   Tell us about your impression of the Apple TV, too.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.260]   I am very impressed by the thing.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.460]   I agree with you on the rental limit.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.860]   24 hours is a little, is under what we should be getting.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.220]   But again, you can pause the thing and come back to it whenever you want.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.780]   I really am very impressed by the picture quality of the HD stuff.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.740]   And even the standard stuff I have never had a problem with.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.300]   I think it's perfectly fine.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   And it down.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   It's really quickly.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.300]   Merlin rented.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   What did you rent that you, that you, Dr. Zhivago, you said?
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   You know what it was?
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.900]   I mean, there's a part of it like, I think they used the original trailers.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.220]   Like the Dr. Zhivago trailer looks like, like I said, I think I said on Twitter, it looks
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.300]   like David Lean's cat used it as a scratching post.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.340]   But the stuff I've gotten has been, I've been buying all HD because it does look really,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.340]   really good.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.500]   I got altered states HD and I was pretty impressed.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   Really?
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.580]   I got shot at in Transformers, Mean Girls and one other movie in Transformers, which is
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.300]   a terrible, terrible movie.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.500]   Oh, it's fun.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   It's a fun movie.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.180]   But, right, yeah, it looked fantastic.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.140]   And that's a movie that, now, actually I wanted to bring this up with you, Alex, because you
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.620]   probably know more about this than anybody else.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.100]   George Wu writing in ZDNet blogs, he does the real world IT column, and usually focuses
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.100]   on security.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.060]   So, he's not a video expert.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.900]   But he's talking, he says, I mean, the title of the article is Don't Believe the Low Bit
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.540]   Rate HD Lie.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:26.860]   And it's relevant now because with HD DVD dead, Blu-ray looking like the future of high-def
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:33.260]   disks, but also challenged by all these services, Apple, Microsoft and others offering high-def
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.420]   downloads.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:41.980]   And he says, you know, when you're looking at bit rates on H.264 of one and a half to
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:46.020]   four megabits at 720p, that's not high-def.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:51.780]   I mean, it's technically 720p, but is it being over-compressed?
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:52.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.860]   I mean, it's being crushed.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:00.380]   I mean, the question really gets back to whether number one is the movie itself.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.620]   And number two is what's good enough?
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.420]   You know, so the thing that it's absolutely being over-compressed, when you're, they are
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.420]   doing the best they can to get a high-quality video out at 30 gigs for Blu-ray.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:19.900]   So is it, I can still see it on Blu-ray, but I mean, I'm saying is it unfair for somebody
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.540]   like Apple to say high-def downloads when these things are so much worse than it's
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.540]   true.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.540]   It's high-def.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.740]   Resolution is how people are defining high-def.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.300]   They're not doing high-quality.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   They're not saying it's high-quality, but they're saying it's high-def.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.540]   It is technically 720p or 1080p, but don't people assume it?
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.500]   High-def means high-quality?
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.220]   Well, it looks better than standard-def.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.220]   Does it?
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.220]   Does it sharper than standard?
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.220]   Here's the deal.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.220]   Here's what you give up.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.060]   And I'm going to ruin everybody's viewing experience.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.860]   Scott, who's not on here, had the misfortune of me walking in and watching, looking at
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.420]   his HD monitor while he's watching cable.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.340]   Because you've got to remember, cable is mashing what you're watching as well.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   You have a lot of press too.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.820]   Far worse than Blu-ray.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.140]   Not probably better than what you're seeing from Apple TV, but they're really wackin'
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.260]   it to get it onto your into your cable input.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.860]   When they say digitally enhanced or whatever, that means they crush the bejibbers out of
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.860]   it.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.420]   What you're going to see, and you'll see if you're watching HD cable as well as if you
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.900]   watch Apple TV, is you're going to see blocks.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.620]   These macro blocks are colors.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.820]   When the colors get close together, when you get a bunch of blacks that are, for instance,
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.660]   getting close together on a dark shot or smoke or a big green wall, what you're going to
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.140]   start noticing along those edges in the middle.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.980]   And with water, you're going to see these big...
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.380]   And here's the other place you're going to notice it, is when the camera moves a lot.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.880]   So a born identity tends to fall apart much faster or a born supremacy tends to fall apart
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.580]   much faster than Kundun.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.180]   And the reason is, is that Kundun doesn't, you know, Scorsese doesn't move the camera
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.180]   very much.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.940]   He likes everything to unfold.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.380]   And that means that not too much is the compressor doesn't have to change too much in the image.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.620]   When you start hand holding it and moving stuff around all the time, that puts a lot
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.940]   more pressure on it because it has a hard limit on how, what the bandwidth can be.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.060]   And so what happens is the image actually starts to fall apart.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.460]   Here's what Ooh says.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:22.620]   He says, "Standard definition DVDs are 5 to 8 megabits, MPEG-2.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.500]   He says you just can't compare that to 1.5 to 4.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:32.260]   Or is the top bit rate of the Apple TV 2, 1 to 4, 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 to 4 megabits of 720
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.260]   pH.264."
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:40.860]   He says, "Apple and Microsoft should not use the HD name with video that's lower fidelity
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.500]   than a standard DVD."
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.580]   Well, I think that I think that they, once again, I think that everybody has been defining
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.580]   it.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.540]   That would be changing the rules in some respects.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.940]   I do agree that they can call it HD.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:58.620]   I'm not totally convinced that I'm really getting that much of a better image on my 36-inch HD
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.620]   monitor.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.820]   Once I start getting larger, maybe I notice the sharpness, maybe I don't.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.820]   I think it's actually the other way around.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.180]   I think you're not going to see the defects nearly as well on a small monitor.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.220]   As soon as you get to a big monitor, you really can see all the effects.
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.220]   Oh, I think you will.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.380]   Because you'll see those macro blocks pretty quickly.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.100]   You know, and what I mean by that though.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.100]   Sorry.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.740]   I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.900]   And anybody who's seen digitally compressed video knows exactly.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.860]   You know when you see it, I mean, there was a movie I was watching not long ago.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.260]   And this is my back pocket description of what looks bad.
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.140]   Is any time too much is happening at once.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.660]   And to me, that could be, as you say, when things are blowing around, smoke, you definitely
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.140]   see it with anything involving running water.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.340]   But you can just see these.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.740]   The artifacts are crazy.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.020]   I mean, it looks like a 20% JPEG is on screen.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   Right.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.140]   Or anything that is a night scene or dark or there's a large...
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.380]   A lot of times, a lot of movies now have big black spots.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.380]   And you really can see it in there because they just can't handle it.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.940]   So I think that I think it's inappropriate to call it HD.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.780]   I think they are providing that quality.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:07.500]   I do think there's a good argument that we really should be aiming a little higher.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.940]   And as a user, I don't need it to start up immediately.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.500]   I'd rather have three days to watch it and say I want to watch it and then go about my
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.740]   business for a little while, let it cash up or whatever.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:22.620]   What are your download experiences in terms of time for a high def movie?
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.660]   Chris Breen, you said it was pretty fast.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.820]   Yeah, it depends on the kind of bandwidth you've got.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.900]   But I've got about four megabits coming down.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.380]   It takes about 10 to 12 minutes before you can start watching it.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.380]   A little notice.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.300]   So you're able to even start a high def movie?
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.100]   No, a standard def, you can start it under a minute.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.300]   Yeah, it's real fast.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.260]   But yeah, same for me, Chris, on Comcast.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.980]   You'd have to have enough bandwidth so that you could download it in real time though,
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:48.980]   or will not stream.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.180]   In other words, if you can't download it in two hours for a two hour movie, it's not
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.180]   going to happen.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.180]   Yeah, what it'll do is it'll cash up to about 10 to 11 percent and then it will say, okay,
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.180]   I'm ready to go.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.180]   Right.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.940]   But again, it has to be fast enough.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:07.940]   So if we're talking one and a half megabits for the bottom side of HD, if your connection
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.300]   is one and a half megabits, you're not going to be able to stream that.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.820]   No, you're going to have to wait.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.220]   I think they've got a little table.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.500]   On Apple's side that says, wait eight hours or something if you've got 768.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   Right.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.500]   Okay.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:25.220]   And I think the one thing that we want to think about in a land where Netflix rules,
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:30.060]   large sections of our experience is that a lot of times we're willing to put something
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:34.180]   in a queue and say we want to watch it or put a bunch of stuff in a queue and watch those
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.180]   things.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.380]   I don't really have a problem telling deciding on there's a handful of movies that I want
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.420]   to watch these next four movies over the next whatever and have them or this.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.500]   You know, I don't necessarily want to do one movie, but I want to have the choice between
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.300]   these next three or four movies, but I don't need them until the next couple of days.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.860]   You know, and if it just in the background was sucking up the amount of time, the data
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.180]   that I needed, I don't need to necessarily watch something right when I click on it.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.980]   I still think that a lot of times when we're developing these technologies, we're missing
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:09.020]   the point that the only thing you need to see live is news and sports.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:16.340]   You know, and I think the TV vastly overestimates the need to have that click through and be
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.500]   able to watch it immediately.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.100]   I mean, we get Tivo so that we don't have to do that.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.740]   Yeah, but you guys aren't there yet, but you will be in a few years and that's the four
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.180]   year old factor.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.020]   And that's when your four year old is sitting on the couch with you and says, "Daddy, I
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.500]   want to watch bugs.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.580]   I want to watch something now."
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.780]   And you go, "Oh, okay.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.380]   Oh, good.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.380]   Here is Hercules.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.700]   That will be great."
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.900]   Oh, honey, can I give you something else to do for the next 10 minutes?
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.900]   No!
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.900]   But that's a collection.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:51.420]   I mean, when I grew up, I don't know, that was a very large DVD collection or GHS.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.740]   I think what you're describing is absolutely doable, Alex.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.700]   I think it's just a change in attitude.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.540]   I think once, for example, like, can you think about, I don't know how much, how many
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.700]   you guys are Tivo or DVR users?
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:07.740]   Like the attitude of somebody before and after having a DVR is so fundamentally different
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.740]   as to be disruptive.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.940]   I mean, it took me a while to go like, "Oh, I want to record this and I want to record."
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.420]   And I still kept thinking about like a VCR.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.420]   Right.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.420]   Like it was adding stuff to a playlist.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.860]   And so I'm with you, Alex, in that sense.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.980]   Like it took me a while before I went, "Okay, instead I'm going to throw a lot of opinions
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.780]   about what I like and things I want you to watch for me and wishlist and catch this and
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.780]   catch that."
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.580]   And then sit back and let it do its work.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.060]   But that is a very different behavior from Chris's, like, "I want to watch Peter Pan
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.740]   now or whatever."
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.660]   But I think that change will come.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.260]   It's just going to take time and more people on things like DVRs.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:43.620]   And a lot of people who have kids with and have DVRs just queue up a ton of stuff that's
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:44.620]   just always there.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.620]   And think about BitTorrent.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.940]   I mean, there are people out there, I understand, who use BitTorrent and they don't seem to
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.140]   mind at all that it takes a certain amount of time.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.140]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.140]   It's like that's a different behavior.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:58.180]   Now that HD DVD is dead, and by the way, that happened officially last night, Toshiba
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.980]   did say we are going to stop manufacturing HD DVD players and now no one in their right
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.940]   mind can imagine anyway.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.860]   HD DVD is clearly out of business.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.460]   Blu-ray, which Apple, by the way, backed.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.100]   Apple's one of the Blu-ray backers, unlike Microsoft, is now the winner.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.740]   But we still don't see Blu-ray recorders in Apple equipment.
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.100]   Chris Green, why is that?
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.940]   Have you ever asked them, "Where's our Blu-ray?"
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:27.620]   I have not asked them that, but I think it's exactly the reason that we all think is because
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.260]   even though they were backing it, they weren't sure which side to jump on.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.260]   And now they know.
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.260]   Now we know.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.860]   But Apple's moving on the disc, so forget it.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   Yeah, really.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.940]   Oh, and the air now, in the air movies.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.940]   That's right.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.020]   It's all on the air movie stuff.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.420]   The question is really whether Apple will put it.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:49.460]   I mean, how long will it take and whether they will delay putting Blu-ray on there specifically
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:55.260]   to keep on pushing the idea of you can download all those movies instead of using the Blu-ray.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.700]   Don't a lot of people like you, though, want a Mac Pro with a Blu-ray burner in it?
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   I love it.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.180]   And I think it's an archival.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.820]   Being able to put 40 gigs or 50 gigs on one disc would actually go back to discs.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.540]   I mean, right now we don't even consider it.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.300]   That's the capacity of the Blu-ray discs.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.300]   My gosh.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.300]   Wow.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.780]   And that's probably the good thing about it and the good reason that it won was it was
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.380]   more than HD DVD.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.780]   And I think ultimately if you had to pick one thing, that's probably what we'll put it
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.380]   over the top, at least certainly from the computer company's point of view.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:32.940]   I mean, I think even Microsoft is going to have to put a Blu-ray now in Xbox or at least
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   offer it with Xbox.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.500]   A lot of my friends have been, I've noticed Gruber talking about this on the Twitter.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.820]   A lot of people are saying, "Okay, well, now I've been sitting on this like me, for example.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.220]   I'm sitting here going, "I am so going to wait for this to shake out.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.660]   I'm not going to buy a beta max."
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.220]   Well, now we know what to buy.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:51.420]   A lot of people are saying, "I understand that you should just go out and buy a PS3.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.900]   Do you guys have an opinion on this?"
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   Yes.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   That's the answer, by the way.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.900]   And that's like what?
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.900]   400 bucks.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.380]   The Blu-ray player right now, standalone is about 350, so you're spending 50 bucks more
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.180]   and you get the whole PS3.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.780]   Plus it's the best Blu-ray player.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:05.780]   It's upgradable.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.780]   It's got a hard drive.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.780]   I think everybody agrees.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:13.500]   I mean, it's a little noisier than a dedicated DVD player, I guess.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.980]   But it's probably the best Blu-ray player.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.980]   How big is that?
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:16.980]   What size of a what?
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.140]   A box at Yatsi?
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.140]   How big is that?
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.500]   It looks like a bread box.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.100]   It's got this curved face to it.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.980]   It's quite attractive.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:31.420]   But because it's curved, it doesn't stack in there with the rest of your stuff.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.340]   Sony clearly designed it to stand out.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:42.460]   I would say volume-wise, no bigger than any other DVD player.
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:47.220]   Except the very smallest ones, but it's no bigger than any other HD DVD player.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.420]   But it's not rack-mountable.
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.420]   No.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.900]   It depends on the kind of rack you have.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.580]   We had a swoopy-doopy rack.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.580]   It's curved.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.580]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.180]   It's piano, black, and it's gorgeous.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.180]   Ever consider that?
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.020]   Alex, maybe the problem is your rack.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.420]   Yes, I never thought.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   It made a new rack.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.980]   I never thought of that.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:12.260]   So, of course, as Apple continues to negotiate with international carriers to bring the iPhone
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:17.180]   to countries around the world, according to China Mobile, the biggest wireless carrier
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:23.660]   in China, there about half a million, that's a 400,000, cracked iPhones using its network.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.060]   One out of every 10 iPhone shipments is being used in China.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:33.740]   Which is an amazing thing when you think about how much money, because they cost $450
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   to $600 in China.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.780]   So that's an awful lot of disposable income.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.060]   That's a several months wage, probably.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.060]   For some of these.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.060]   Well, well, for some.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.620]   But I mean, there are also billionaires and they can afford it.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:52.260]   In any developing country, what you have is you go to Zimbabwe and there's Mercedes-Benz
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.260]   everywhere.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.260]   So it's not in the capital.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.140]   And then there's nothing when you get 15 miles out.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:04.820]   So I think that a lot of the, there is in China, I mean, there's a billion people there.
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.980]   So there's probably 10 million or 20 million people, which is statistically insignificant,
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.980]   but still enough to buy.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.060]   They're the ones that want to buy everything that as it comes out.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.060]   400,000.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.180]   And this is coming from a carrier, so they know exactly what phones are on their network.
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.300]   It's really interesting.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.620]   I don't know what happens now.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.700]   As far as Apple moving into China, but I would imagine this is good leverage for them.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.980]   Shows demand.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.300]   Is there any, I don't think there's any technical issue of sending to China.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.980]   No, like technology laws or anything else that.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.180]   That's an interesting question.
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.580]   I mean, we have this horrible balance of trade with China.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.940]   It'd be kind of nice to have, instead of us buying iPods made by them, then buying something
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.980]   made by them that we made that we should back to them.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.980]   All right.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:50.980]   They could just walk it across the street.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:51.980]   Never mind.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.220]   There's a lot of, there's a lot of, there's a lot of carbon that's going to be muted to
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.820]   send the iPhones all the way to the United States and then back.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.860]   You know, Chris, were you tempted when Rush Limbaugh started going on the air and complaining
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.340]   about his problems with the Macintosh?
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.900]   Were you tempted to call in and say, I can help you rush?
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:08.900]   Yeah, I was.
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.620]   Actually, I said, just, you know, send your computers to me, Rush.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.620]   And I'll take care of you.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.740]   He works for the same company I do, the same syndicator.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.460]   I was, I was heard he didn't call me.
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.180]   Although the things he was complaining about, everybody complains about, a time machine
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.460]   won't back up email.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.300]   That's right, right?
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.820]   And he didn't like that.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.820]   And what was the other complaint?
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:32.260]   I can't remember it, but it was, it was, it was a known, a known difficulty and a problem.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.820]   And he wanted Steve to personally take care of this, right?
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.900]   Yeah, I can, I can, I could read the transcript, you people, if you want in Rush's voice.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:46.500]   Let me see if I, for those of you watching on the ditto cam today, he's, he says, I've
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:50.140]   been pretty animated talking to the broadcast engineer and my trusty aide, the camp and chief
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.140]   of staff HR.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.740]   I didn't want to bring this up.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.900]   I hadn't thought I was going to bring it up.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.100]   You know, I'm a big Mac guy.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   I love Macs.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.180]   I've got four Mac pros that they're the top of the line.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:04.060]   Mac pros maxed out and I just got a new system upgrade, went to leopard.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.060]   It was a big, big update.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.900]   I've been having two problems since I went to leopard.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.060]   I hope this update would solve.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.860]   He's talking about 10, 5, 2 and it didn't solve them.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.860]   And it's frustrating.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   This is on the air.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:18.260]   When normally he's talking about politics, I'm telling, I'm telling these guys I've worked
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.260]   patiently.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.740]   I've been very patient with my Apple rep.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.300]   Do you have an Apple rep?
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.940]   My Apple rep with my developer rep.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.700]   He's got two reps and they're working hard on it, but nothing gets done.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:38.780]   All use file reports and get lost in the Apple bureaucratic system.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.020]   He says they're having the same problem at Apple that I'm having here.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.180]   So I'm asking these guys during the break, do you think I ought to put out a plea to Steve
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.180]   Jobs?
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:50.820]   I know he's politically opposite of me, but just to say, Mr. Jobs, please, I ordered six
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:56.380]   brand new Mac pros for me to his gifts maxed out Blu-ray drives.
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.100]   Can you order Blu-ray drives?
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:59.100]   No.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.180]   See, he's got a rep.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   He's got a rep.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.700]   He's got a rep with a blue ray.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.700]   He's not paying for this stuff.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.780]   I loaded them up.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.660]   Our whole officer is Mac.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.980]   I just wanted to work because I love them.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.940]   I'm experiencing what psychologists call cognitive dizziness.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.700]   It's a little weird.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.700]   It's very off-putting.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.860]   Well, Rush is a snob.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.820]   I guess he's got white teeth, but he's certainly not green.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.300]   And then like me, he has pain management issues.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.300]   Yes, he does.
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.580]   As we know, I think the whole Blu-ray thing was a side effect.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.260]   Yeah, maybe he's hallucinating that he's got Blu-ray drives.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:34.660]   Also, there are several large elves that are standing on my head.
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.260]   So I guess I'm still trying to find out what the problem is.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.260]   This guy, boy, is he bloviate.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.660]   No, no, no, no.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.660]   I mean, like eight pair of rest down.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.220]   I'll bet he gets something out of it.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.220]   Don't you think?
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.420]   I mean, gosh, if you're a product--
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.980]   Well, that's the new story.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.500]   Apple called.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:55.940]   Rush Limbaugh says this is a transcript from the show yesterday.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.180]   I have an announcement to make.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.260]   Apple corporate called somebody high up on the corporate ladder
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.180]   at Apple out in Cupertino called the office.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.780]   Geez.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.460]   All right, they called me at 9 o'clock this morning.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.980]   Very, very, very nice guy.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.020]   I put my IT guy in touch with him, working.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.660]   No, it was not Al Gore.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.900]   No, Mr. Stern Lee was not Al Gore.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.420]   Anyway, so the IT guy's working with him.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:23.260]   Now, the only one I knew about was time machine
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.180]   not backing up the email.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.620]   I can't find the other one because he goes on and on and on.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.460]   That's interesting.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.100]   So the person at Apple corporate, I mean, you know what?
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.300]   It was just like lost at Liar's dice or--
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.460]   You know, ended up with--
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.660]   Who gets to call Rush?
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.260]   It was one of those nice ladies that calls you and me, Chris.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.980]   They're very sweet.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.180]   I think they're just out of college.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.020]   And their name ends in an eye.
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:47.580]   Yep.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.780]   Hi, this is Brandi with Apple.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.420]   And I--
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.820]   Brandi.
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.420]   And we hear you've been having trouble.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:53.940]   Oh, I know.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.060]   The other one is you couldn't get back to my Mac working.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:57.900]   Oh, surprise.
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.740]   Join the club, Rush.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.540]   That's so strange.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.740]   That's bulletproof.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.900]   That is very, very ugly.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.100]   That's such a thing.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:04.900]   Huh.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.420]   That's weird.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.860]   He says, I could do it without back to my Mac.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   But I can't-- well, just true.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.620]   You can use VNC or a lot of other stuff.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.780]   But I can't do it with back to my Mac.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.420]   I think this is really interesting, though,
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.900]   because I mean, gosh, you got to have to imagine
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.580]   that he is a really busy guy.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.580]   I mean, and yet, obviously, he's a nerd.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.140]   Like, he's spent a lot of time with this stuff.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.940]   I mean, how many people do you know
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.860]   that are sitting around talking about kind of weird,
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.380]   not obvious features of life?
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.420]   I don't think he's one member of Congress that could say,
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.100]   oh, yeah, time machine doesn't back up email.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.380]   Lawrence Lessig, if he makes it, get Larry Lessig in there.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:35.900]   He'll know.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.820]   Yeah, are you part of the draft Larry to take a Lantos?
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.300]   I don't know.
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.300]   I don't even know.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.020]   Where does he live?
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:42.540]   I don't even know.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.220]   Is he in Washington?
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:43.860]   Is that where he lives?
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.900]   Larry Lessig?
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:45.820]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.900]   He lives in Palo Alto.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.300]   Is it Stanford?
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:47.740]   Oh, that's right.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:48.260]   He still stands for it.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.180]   That's right.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.540]   No, he's in the district.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:51.820]   He was in Lantos' district.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.220]   He actually could do it.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.140]   I doubt he would want to.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.300]   I don't know why-- yeah.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.540]   I wonder what one really, really smart guy can do in Congress.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.500]   That's--
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.980]   Actually, the story of the--
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:02.780]   there's a little twit--
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:03.780]   I don't know if it would damage you.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.420]   That's the problem.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.860]   I think that the radiation--
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.100]   No, I think it would be great to get somebody with Larry's
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.780]   intelligence in there, at least talking to these guys,
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:16.020]   saying, look, here's the issues, particularly with copyright.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.300]   But the job would just be until November.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.900]   Then you have to go through another election,
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.220]   a general election in November.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.980]   And I don't think Larry would be that interested in it.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:29.340]   However, the call to draft Larry began on this week in law,
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.700]   which we're going to put up in another couple of days.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.900]   John Palfrey, who's one of the attorneys on that show,
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.500]   actually started the forum and got the ball rolling.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.860]   So of course, the show hasn't aired yet,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.540]   so I don't know if I can take any credit for it.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:47.580]   But anyway, you can hear it here last a little later on this week.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.660]   We'll put the show up.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.780]   I think you just scooped yourself.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.180]   I scooped myself.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.260]   In a strange accident involving a time machine
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.460]   and a contraceptive.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.100]   I am now here to tell you, I am my child's brother.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.460]   Let's see, what else?
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:04.980]   Rush Limbaugh got a call from, do you think Steve called him?
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.820]   No.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.900]   I think if I were Steve, I'd be tempted.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.820]   You know, I mean, Limba's got more clout
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.700]   than Walt Mossberg when it comes to selling Macs.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.780]   If Rush Limbaugh says go out and buy a Mac.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.940]   Selling Macs to a, there's definitely a cross section there
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.260]   that they're not reaching, but Apple's not reaching the rush.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.020]   Absolutely, it'd be very good for them.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:27.060]   I mean, I don't think, I mean, if I'm Apple,
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:29.060]   I cultivate Rush Limbaugh like crazy.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.660]   Yeah, but I mean, how well did Macs run off
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.340]   a turpentine generator?
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.220]   I knew somebody was gonna do it.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.500]   Chris Green ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.460]   He's the Prius driving green knudnick
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.340]   with white teeth and sneakers.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.980]   Snob the snob.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:44.820]   You can write it.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.220]   And also for all liberals too, that was part of the thing.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.060]   Was it? We're all politically.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:49.460]   That's true.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.380]   Yeah, that is true.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.220]   That is true.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.420]   That is why this whole thing with Rush Limbaugh's so puzzling.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.260]   I'm not gonna say that.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.780]   I am not what you'd call a Rush Limbaugh fan,
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:58.700]   but I think that's pretty cool.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.060]   I always like hearing somebody
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.740]   who's gotten engaged with the Mac,
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.420]   who's like gotten past the Switch part
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.580]   and now they're tinkering.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.300]   And I mean, I hate to sound kind of stunning.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.140]   He might've been doing this for you.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.820]   No, he's been a Mac guy for a long time.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.660]   Oh yeah, exactly.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.220]   So I mean, obviously I don't listen to his show,
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.820]   but that's, I think that's pretty cool
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:16.300]   that he's a Mac guy.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.140]   I think that's all right.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.100]   More than that, I think he's a geek.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.900]   Let's do our Audible Pick of the Week
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:24.460]   and then we'll do your software and hardware picks.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.420]   By the way, I should mention that Scott
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.620]   born couldn't join us today.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:32.060]   He had a conflicting appointment and Andy called us.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.140]   We were really hoping to get him on.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.540]   He couldn't be in the Dunscap studios today.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.020]   He was in the field, but that was the problem
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.580]   is he, I don't think he had a very good connection
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.260]   and I had to boot him.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.620]   So, and he's sad about it and we're sad about it,
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.780]   but he'll be back next week, I'm sure.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.540]   But we couldn't get either of them on.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.300]   And normally Andy does all of the,
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.700]   all the picks, the Audible picks,
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.580]   but I'm gonna do one today because it's a guy I'm about.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.060]   - He's the only one who is in the books.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.100]   - Yeah, he's the only actual reader in the bunch.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.260]   No, come on, we're all.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.980]   - I have to say that since we started doing
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.620]   this Audible thing that I find my,
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.260]   you know, I started, you kind of opened up
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.060]   this little crack and now I'm downloading books all the time.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.860]   - Yeah, book reading is great.
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:11.900]   - Yeah, I mean, I've been listening.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.660]   - I mean, I mentioned this on the last, on a different show,
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.300]   but I've been reading these new Steve Martin book
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.540]   standing up, which is memoir.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.940]   He reads it and it's really, really,
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.540]   I cannot recommend it more highly.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.900]   But that's not my recommendation of the week.
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.100]   I'm actually gonna recommend a book
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.900]   that is a Silicon Valley thriller.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.700]   There is such a thing.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:32.940]   - Night crunch.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:33.980]   - And blood.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.580]   - Mac Richtell is a New York Times writer.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.460]   He writes often about obsessed technology obsession,
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.580]   how technology impacts our lives.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.740]   And he has written a book called Hooked,
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:47.500]   a thriller about love and other addictions
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.620]   that takes place in the Silicon Valley.
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:56.380]   And it involves venture capitalists and bombs going off.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.060]   And it's actually quite dramatic and quite,
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.620]   I'm really enjoying it, quite, quite a good book.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.820]   Highly recommend it.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.260]   It's called Hooked, a thriller about love
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.420]   and other addictions and I like the tech angle on it.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.660]   I think it's just a matter of time before here,
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.460]   more and more of these books kind of taking advantage
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.100]   of the passions of Silicon Valley.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.500]   Now here's the deal on this.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.180]   Audible is a place where you can download books
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.380]   read by the best people in the world.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.580]   And this is really important.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.780]   You can, you know, you go to the bookstore
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.020]   and you can buy the books.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.620]   And there, it's often they're read by the author
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.740]   and sometimes authors are good, but sometimes not so good.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.660]   When Steve Martin reads, that's fine.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.380]   Some of these guys shouldn't be reading.
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.900]   And frankly, they're often highly abridged.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.580]   This is not that experience.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.500]   These are, most of them, unabridged.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.340]   They do have some abridged.
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.220]   In fact, in this case, Hooked,
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.300]   you have abridged and unabridged.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.140]   So you can choose depending on your time.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.940]   But you have the choice of unabridged
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.940]   read by professional actors who really bring the books to life.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.900]   I mean, they, it makes a big difference.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.820]   It's really, that was a big thing for me
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.100]   when I discovered Audible.
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.100]   Plus you get them right away.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.940]   I mean, you know, books are not as big as high-def video.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.780]   So if your daughter wants to hear a children's book,
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.820]   you can download it in a matter of seconds.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.660]   Here's what you do.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.100]   Get a free book by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.220]   And it could be Hooked or any of the 45,000 other books.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.940]   You could play it on any iPod or iPhone or a lot of other devices,
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.540]   hundreds of different devices.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.500]   And I think you're going to love it.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.460]   Just try one.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.460]   That's all. Just try one.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.700]   And you'll get Hooked just as Mr. Alex Lindsey has.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.980]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.420]   We thank them for their support.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.980]   It is now time, my friends, to do our picks of the week.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.340]   Software picks.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.580]   We haven't done a wine in a while.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.700]   Should we bring back wines?
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.540]   Not now.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.380]   But we could do it now if you have wines.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.500]   Oh, I always got wines.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.100]   I would love to bring back wines.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.980]   Merlin's always really the one who wanted to wine.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.980]   I like to wine.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.100]   It's a core competency, Leo.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.900]   It's something that I really spend a lot of time.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.860]   He has a Mac user and snob.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.780]   And people who makes fun of everyone is not like me.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.540]   A lot of what I do is whining based.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.700]   Well, let's do a pick and a pan, an optional pan.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.020]   So if you have a pick, great.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.140]   But if you have a pan, you can do both.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.020]   Do you want to start Merlin?
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020]   Wow.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.940]   Or are you still trying to remember your pick?
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.140]   I think I remember my pick.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.180]   And here's the problem.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:11.900]   I have this tendency.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.340]   You'll notice that I think I don't listen to the show that much
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:15.980]   after we taped it.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.780]   But my sense is that I frequently begin my pick by saying,
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.060]   have we done food yet?
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.460]   We all do that.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.140]   Did we last week that somebody do screen flow yet?
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.580]   Oh, that's mine for this week.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.060]   No!
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:27.980]   You can both do it.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.620]   We should both do it because it's so cool.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.060]   Do you want to start?
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.260]   You want me to?
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.500]   OK, I've done about--
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.100]   I did about two hours of captures over the weekend
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.060]   with ScreenFlow.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.420]   You've got to tell people what it is.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.020]   OK, so ScreenFlow is it's another--
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.100]   it's in the family of Screen Capture utilities.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.020]   But then it goes way further.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.940]   So you have--
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:51.060]   I show you, which is about $20, and is really good.
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.460]   I mean, it captures quickly, and it's inexpensive.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.100]   And you have the movie done as soon as you finish capturing,
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:57.580]   which is great.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.140]   Then you have Snaps, which is the diehard.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.180]   I mean, that's when we need to make sure that we capture it,
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.180]   generally we're using Snaps still.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.540]   And then you have this new ScreenFlow.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:09.900]   And this is by Vera software.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.380]   They do--
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.380]   Firecast.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.820]   Firecast, and so on and so forth.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.700]   It's cute.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.300]   Yeah, and so--
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.700]   but this is-- I mean, it's at a whole different level.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.820]   So just interrupting wherever you want from Merlin.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.420]   But I--
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.300]   Oh, I'll-- I mean, the only opener I would make
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.740]   is to say-- like, I would begin by just saying Vera software.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.900]   Like, for what it's worth, if you're doing anything that
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.100]   involves podcasting and demonstrations on a Mac,
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.820]   you need to be using one of their products.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.780]   Wirecast lets you basically broadcast things
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.820]   using your Mac in a camera.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.620]   VideoCupro, which I learned about from--
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.740]   I think it was Callie Lewis--
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.860]   lets you do a one-person podcast with a script.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.220]   It's awesome.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.820]   And this-- I mean, I don't want to steal the lead here,
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.020]   but it makes it really easy for you to capture both video
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.860]   and a screen capture at the same time, which previously
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.700]   took a ridiculous amount of training and equipment to do.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.580]   That's the only thing.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.580]   And the other thing that I haven't actually even used
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.100]   that feature yet, and I'm excited about it,
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.940]   which is that when you capture it,
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.540]   you sit there and you set up the capture,
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.540]   and you capture it.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.380]   It's pretty much like any other capture program.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.580]   Then you go back to work.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.580]   It says, OK, here we go.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.820]   It's two tracks.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.460]   I mean, just so people get the idea, you're sitting there.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.460]   Like, in my case, I'm sitting there with my MacBook Pro.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:18.020]   The camera's pointing at my stupid face,
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.540]   and I'm doing something on my Mac.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.260]   I don't have to do anything special.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:23.860]   I can plug in a DV camera, but I don't have to.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.380]   All I do is start talking and using something on my Mac,
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.180]   and it's capturing this on two different tracks,
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.420]   just like in GarageBand.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.140]   That's kind of neat.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:33.140]   So can you then, after the fact, cut back and forth?
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.020]   Well, here's the thing is that--
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.780]   Well, Merlin, can you answer that question?
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.620]   I actually did.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.140]   What it does is--
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:38.980]   --you get your video into it.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.780]   Is it an inset?
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.620]   Or you--
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.700]   You can do it however you want.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.420]   You have complete control through a timeline.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.700]   It's a little bit wonky.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.220]   But if you ever use stuff back in the day,
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.260]   like, what was that Adobe video program I used to?
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.260]   Premiere.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.460]   It's a lot-- I found it a little bit like using Premiere,
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.140]   where you basically can select areas--
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.620]   Oh, I see.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.740]   Say, this part, show me, this part, show the screen.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.980]   I'm still getting the hang of resizing video and stuff,
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:59.340]   but it basically has transitions.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.980]   But it's a super lightweight eye movie.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.700]   Yeah, and the other thing about it
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.620]   is that it is keeping track of--
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.140]   and I don't know what it's doing to do this,
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:10.700]   but it's keeping track of both the icon as well as knowing
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:11.940]   what the front window is.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.300]   And so what I was doing is I was doing some technical training
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.620]   for one of our applications conduit.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.140]   And so what I want to do is I want
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.020]   to have the dialogue box that I'm talking about zoom up,
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.540]   and everything else goes dark.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.500]   And all I got to do is say, add what they call a call out,
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500]   and say how long the transition should be.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.820]   And that window just pops right up.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:36.420]   It just zooms up to whatever 200x or whatever,
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.620]   and you can see me working on it.
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.660]   And then when I wanted to zoom back, it just pops back in,
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.100]   and it goes back into the thing.
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.020]   And I do admit I started with one call out here and there,
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.940]   and now I have it calling out to the front window,
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.380]   and then calling out to some of the arrows,
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.420]   and calling out-- and it also keeps track of--
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.020]   and I haven't tried this yet, but it's supposed
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.500]   to keep track of all your keystrokes.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.820]   So you can have your keystrokes visible
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.420]   while you're doing it, which is a big problem
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.260]   when you're doing training.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.180]   And so it is--
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:05:59.700]   How do you show that?
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.700]   Does it show it to the bottom of the screen?
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.060]   Yeah, I haven't actually turned it on.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.220]   I just saw the buttons there, and I was like, oh my gosh,
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.060]   I can't believe it's doing that.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.060]   What if it throws up a HUD or something like this?
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.140]   Would that be cool?
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.020]   See, that's something people have asked us for
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.780]   when we did our Photoshop things.
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.340]   When we did the Quicksilver episode of the Merlin show,
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.260]   like we had to sit up with Alex Nodes.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.940]   I had an area in his office set up.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.740]   You had to sit there, you got to set up a camera,
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:21.900]   you got to get mixture.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.860]   And I mean, as awesome as I show you is,
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.180]   to me it's the program for capturing screen stuff up till now.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.380]   It's like you have to be very specific about make sure
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.300]   you get the aspect ratios to match.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.620]   I mean, for a lot of you out there,
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.100]   this is not going to make any sense at all.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.540]   But if you're doing anything with demonstrations,
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.420]   you know what a huge pain in the ass of this stuff is.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.500]   And the call outs alone, like you basically select an area
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.100]   and say, do this call out here.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.860]   Basically make a little circle of the size that I choose
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.100]   around the cursor, make everything black out,
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.340]   zoom in 300%.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.660]   And now stop doing it.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.020]   And now make my face go here instead of there.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.660]   And the great thing about this is also,
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.500]   if you're doing half res,
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.260]   'cause a lot of times we're capturing the screen at full res,
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.500]   and we want to go back down to half res,
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.820]   that call out for that dialogue walks makes it still readable.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.260]   You know, but you don't give up the whole screen
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.420]   when you're trying to show the overall view
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.100]   of what's going on, really.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:09.940]   - Oh, sounds like something.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.620]   - I have a question, a workflow question,
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.860]   'cause I know that's what you specialize at.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.500]   Now that I'm, you know, this is quarter one.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.260]   So for me, it's all about building capacity.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.300]   My thing is like, if I export that,
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.100]   or if I save that file and I send that to somebody like say,
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.380]   oh, let's say Ben or Darren, as a file,
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.460]   can they then go in and do the magic?
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.060]   - Yeah, here's the thing that this is the one short fall,
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.580]   I think right now of their version.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.380]   And I sent them to the laundry list of changes I want,
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.540]   inside of the fact that it's the best thing I've ever used
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.780]   to do this, but here are a whole bunch of changes
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.780]   that I'd love to see.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.340]   And one of them was that they need to have
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.620]   an animation out, you know, setting, because right now,
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.380]   it's really designed that you're gonna capture,
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.540]   and then you're gonna send it out to H.264 for the web,
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.340]   or for compressed footage.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.820]   But the problem is, if you're a professional
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.700]   doing a lot of these screen captures,
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.300]   you don't want to do that, because you want a pristine version
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.020]   of whatever you captured that you can recompress over time.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.700]   - Like export both tracks, for example, would be good.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.060]   - Well, I don't worry about that.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.220]   I just worry about making sure that when it's finished,
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.540]   there's a clean version that I'm gonna use
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.860]   as the basis of my compression to go out
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:11.900]   to whatever else I want to do.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:15.060]   I don't want to have it mash it down to H.264
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.140]   and then wish later, oh, I really wish I had
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.780]   a higher quality version to go back to.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:22.780]   And so anyway, so I tend to want to have it,
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.900]   I want that pristine version,
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.860]   I can throw all of my captures into
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.380]   a compressor later if I want to do that.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.620]   But it's gonna be much easier to use in an editor
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.940]   if I get it in an uncompressed form,
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.300]   if I want to do more work with it, and so on and so forth.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:39.140]   And so I don't think that I'm not that excited
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.820]   about the way that the export works,
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.460]   but I just switch it back to animation and then export it.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.460]   And then I do a little bit of work on the sound.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:51.500]   Typically, I equalize and compress the sound
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.820]   in soundtrack or whatever.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.780]   And I'd love to have those tools inside of this program.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.540]   You never thought of that in the screen capture program
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.780]   until they started putting editors and stuff in it.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.220]   But now you're like, well, I really want to do all the stuff
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.220]   there, I don't want to bother to go out to soundtrack.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.500]   - But I mean, for like, I don't know,
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.420]   consumer to pro, what I'm imagining is like,
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.660]   you're somebody who's like totally overwhelmed
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.220]   with having to do training, let's say in a small office.
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.380]   And like, you basically, you sit down on your computer,
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.740]   let's say you've got a MacBook Pro or an iMac with a camera,
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.740]   you basically turn this thing on and act like you're showing
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.460]   it to somebody that you like, and then send it out.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.180]   And it's, you know, I agree.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:26.020]   - I think it's tough.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.780]   - I've already screwed stuff up where I've coughed
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.380]   or really badly or I've screwed something up
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.220]   for a need to do.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.780]   And you can edit all of that right in the capture
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.700]   before you export.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.900]   - So it's a...
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.660]   - So it has some decent audio editing as well.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.580]   It sounds really like a great program.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.700]   - It doesn't have a lot of audio editing yet.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.180]   It's, you can just snip it.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.020]   You know, so what I did is I just wanted to cut out
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.100]   some areas that I needed to cut out.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.780]   And that's a fairly straightforward process.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:53.980]   - If I record room tone, could I overlay it or paste it in?
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.820]   - Oh yeah. - So it doesn't,
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.980]   so you'll hear a disappear.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.180]   - Yeah, that's on the list.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.340]   (laughing)
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.180]   - That sounds great.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.100]   - I mean, this is a very,
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.340]   yeah, Vera's really been doing some great stuff.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:04.740]   This is Vera's Soft.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:05.580]   - Incredible.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.940]   And I said, it's the best solution.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.620]   I, you know, I think that, you know,
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.580]   that hopefully this is gonna push the other folks
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.860]   to develop something sooner than later yet.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.060]   It's verisoft.com, I think.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.060]   And, yeah.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:16.900]   - Yep.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.740]   - It's $29, which is a good deal.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.660]   Although they have a trial, free trial download.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.780]   So you can see how it works for you.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.380]   There are a lot of people doing screencasts.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.020]   I think there'll be a lot more doing screencasts
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.060]   when this comes out.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.340]   - And it just, it's a much more,
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.940]   especially if you start using those call outs,
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:32.620]   it becomes a much more interactive video.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.900]   The problem with screencasts is they are so freaking boring.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.420]   You know, and so being able to have your video in there
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.100]   when you wanna talk to people and say something
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.140]   that the mouse doesn't require,
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.940]   or being able to pop screens up and down,
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.020]   just that change in interaction,
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.420]   I think is gonna make a huge difference
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.100]   in people's both comprehension and ability
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.620]   to watch long periods of it.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.940]   - Exciting.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.020]   - Yeah, 'cause you don't wanna sit and watch screens,
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.140]   screens, screens, you wanna see a recent ones in a lot.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.580]   - We tried to do this, we did this on the very first product.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.220]   We actually animated everything and After Effects
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.580]   to get this effect.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.020]   And when I looked at this, I was like,
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.700]   (laughing)
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.540]   - They're good.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:10.820]   - And $99 is remarkable.
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.460]   I mean, that's a remarkable price for this.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.900]   - It's a huge jump in,
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.620]   because it's not just a screen capture program.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.140]   It's doing a lot more than that.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.180]   - Well, now that you talk,
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.980]   'cause I didn't wanna do screencasts,
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.340]   but now that you talk about it,
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.260]   it sounds like it's something I could even use,
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.820]   because I'm talking, talking, talking,
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.660]   but every once in a while,
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.180]   I wanna show a website or a screen or something,
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.740]   and it's a way of breaking it up.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:31.660]   - Good.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.580]   - Yeah, I'll definitely try it.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.820]   I've started to do videos of the Cermanets
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.420]   I do at the beginning of each radio show,
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.020]   and I think that'd be very useful to break up the,
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.500]   looking at me, looking at me, looking at me,
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.380]   and I could show some sites and stuff as I've talked about.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.500]   - Yeah, Chris Brie, did you have a wine Merlin?
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.580]   You have a pan you would like to throw in there?
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.900]   - I always have so many.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.740]   - Well, I'll tell you what,
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.340]   we'll hold that for next week.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.060]   - Next week, bring your wines, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.340]   I'll bring the cheese.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.140]   Chris Brie, your pick.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.300]   - Yes, my pick is really expensive,
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.700]   and mostly I'm offering it because I'm bragging
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.100]   that I have it, and--
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.260]   - If it's a MacBook Air, you're out.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.340]   - No, it's not, it's actually a Nikon D300.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.580]   - Oh, you got one.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.460]   - I got one.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.420]   I love this camera.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.500]   - Now, is it a review, or did you actually buy it?
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.580]   - I bought it.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.100]   It was my birthday recently,
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.500]   somebody sent me a nice check for my birthday,
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.420]   and I said, oh, I could fix the stairs,
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.060]   or I could buy myself something totally extravagant,
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:34.580]   a camera so much better than my abilities, and I did.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.620]   I was moving from a Nikon D70,
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.580]   so I'm a Nikon shooter, I've got a few Nikon lenses,
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:42.220]   and I've been feeling a little embarrassed
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.300]   about being a Nikon shooter,
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.180]   because all my friends are Canon shooters,
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.740]   and they're going, oh, but you don't have this,
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.260]   you don't have this, you have this.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.500]   And now I've got this camera,
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.580]   and it shoots, that. - We're all jealous of you.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.420]   - I hope so.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.500]   - That's my ISO. - I have.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.020]   Yeah, I've been doing some low light shooting
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.460]   with this thing, and I moved from my D70,
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.100]   where I just got this really noisy, ugly looking stuff,
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.540]   and I shoot with a D300 now, and it's gorgeous.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.460]   - What's the top ISO on this?
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.860]   - Oh, you can go to forever on this thing.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.100]   - 32, I think it's like, I think 6,400 is it.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.500]   I believe you have top 10. - Wow.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.700]   - Yeah, yeah, but even if you're--
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:21.140]   - 6,400 is like my 1,600 on my Canon.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.300]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.700]   - It's really, really, I mean, we've been talking
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.460]   on this weekend photography, the D300, D3,
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.580]   versus all of this other stuff,
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.580]   has been a big piece of discussion.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.300]   - Now the D3's full frame, this is not full frame.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.340]   - It's not, it's a smaller chip,
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.900]   but it's kind of taking the same approach,
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.020]   is less pixels and a lot more sensitivity.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.900]   And so what you're getting is these really high ISO's
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.300]   that are usable.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.900]   I mean, if you look at some of the images on the web,
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.700]   it's profound.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.420]   - Yeah, and it's a huge jump for my D70,
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.340]   which I thought-- - I love my D70.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.340]   - You know what, yeah, the time was like more camera
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.740]   than I could use, and then I got sort of the limits of it
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.180]   where I realized this thing isn't fast enough for me,
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.180]   the low light shooting is not good.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.220]   So it was time to make that jump again and say,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.660]   okay, I have to get a lot smarter
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.100]   and spend a lot more time with this camera.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.460]   And I haven't taken some really exceptional shots with it yet,
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.260]   'cause I'm still learning the camera,
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.460]   but it's conceivable that I can.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.340]   I like the way the controls are laid out.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.700]   It's very simple to get to the main functions
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.100]   I need to get to.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.500]   Again, low light shooting is great.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.100]   I've got a speed light 600,
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.620]   so I can use that in remote,
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.380]   and I'm starting to play around with that as well.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.740]   So just a wonderful, wonderful camera.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.940]   - I have to admit, I've been looking at the D300 and the D3,
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.780]   and I think that unless Canon does something pretty exciting
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.940]   over the next three to six months,
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.980]   I think the D3 might be my next--
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.620]   - I saw you say something about that.
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.860]   You might move 'cause you have all these Canon lenses, don't you?
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.940]   - I don't have a ton of Canon lenses.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:50.860]   I had a ton of-- - Okay, that was part of it.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   - I had a ton of-- - Oh, a ton of lenses.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.700]   - Yeah.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.820]   - And I went to Canon, I have to admit
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.220]   that I was still dipping my toe in,
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.740]   and I have a handful of lenses,
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.780]   but I had $6,000 of glass from my Nikon,
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.220]   and I didn't go back to that,
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.860]   'cause I was like, well, I'm gonna see what I think,
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.900]   and I was just getting ready to buy glass,
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.540]   and then I started seeing images out of the D3
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:12.060]   goes to 25, 600 ISO.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:12.940]   - Geez.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.460]   - And it is usable.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.940]   I mean, usable at that.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:20.100]   We're talking just an enormous amount of sensitivity,
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.300]   and now I have to admit,
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.140]   I'm just waiting to see if Canon's gonna do something,
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.420]   and we've been talking,
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.500]   and we talk about it almost every week on Twitch,
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.420]   and it's just this,
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.460]   they've made a huge,
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.660]   I mean, Nikon has made a huge leap with the D300
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.700]   and the D3 in front of Canon as far as I'm concerned,
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.420]   because sensitivity is at this point,
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.500]   is so much more important than megapixels,
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.060]   and a lot of the other stuff,
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.060]   because now it means that you can shoot indoor,
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.300]   or you can shoot your kids,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.940]   or shoot a sporting event,
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.180]   and you can have it fast enough.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.940]   I mean, it's a really amazing,
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.500]   both those cameras are just amazing.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.180]   - What lens are you using, Chris?
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.820]   - I'm using an 18 to 200,
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.380]   which is kind of the perfect walk around lens,
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.060]   so you can do wide, you can do telephoto.
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.540]   - That's a 1.6 multiplier,
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.100]   so that's 24 to 300, really, right?
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.900]   And it's just, it's great,
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.260]   and it's a small, compact lens,
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.220]   so it's, when you extend it,
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.540]   it looks bizarre, but...
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.380]   - And what's the aperture?
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.380]   What's the widest aperture?
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.540]   - Oh, I got a second.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.980]   - Like, if you wanna go to Flickr,
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.380]   and look at, I love the camera finder in Flickr,
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:25.740]   'cause you could see what images
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.340]   people are getting with various cameras,
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.180]   and it's flicker.com/cameras/nicon,
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.140]   and then you can see all the nikons,
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:32.380]   and if you do slash D300,
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.300]   you could see all the,
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.580]   there's about 6,000 D300 images on there.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.020]   - Yeah, it's 3.5, Alex.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.420]   - Yeah, so, and that's where that fast ISO
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.340]   is gonna make a big difference,
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.460]   because that's like having a lens,
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.900]   it's not the same depth of field,
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.940]   but it's like having the same sensitivity
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.820]   as like a 1.4 lens.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.980]   - Yeah, I'm looking at some of the night shots
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.300]   people have been getting with this
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.780]   in their spectacular, they just speak of their.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.420]   - I mean, I talked to a friend of mine
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.580]   who went on a shoot with,
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.980]   I think it was actually the D3,
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.500]   and he said that, but he said shooting,
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.540]   he was shooting stuff that he couldn't see,
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:03.460]   and he said it was the closest thing
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.500]   to magic he had ever played.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.340]   - Wow.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.420]   - They made a huge jump,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.540]   Canon has to react,
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.420]   and they have to react quickly,
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.940]   because these two cameras are the most advanced,
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:15.220]   you know, SLR cameras in existence right now.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.460]   - And it's about 1,800 bucks for the body,
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.300]   and then you have to buy a lens to go with it,
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.580]   so it isn't, you're right, Chris,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.980]   it's two or three Alex's here, we're talking.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.420]   - It's a jump if you're sort of the amateur
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.900]   middling photographer like me,
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:33.580]   but it really is an understandable camera.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.180]   You know, even if you're just sort of a moderate shooter,
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.780]   you're not gonna pick this thing up and go,
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.620]   "What?"
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.460]   - Oh.
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:40.980]   - I make a mistake here.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:41.980]   - Your room from point of truth.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.060]   - Yeah, it's gonna be a problem,
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.580]   but moving just something like the D40 or D70, no problem.
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.220]   - A lot of people are raving over this camera,
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.380]   I mean, I hear a lot of good things about it.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.660]   All right, well, I have to make up for you guys,
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.380]   I got something free, how about that?
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:56.220]   Free, free, free, and it's, you know,
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.500]   again, like you Merlin, I'm thinking,
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.020]   we must have talked about this at some time,
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.220]   and we probably have, but I don't know if we've recommended it.
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.900]   We're such big, quick silver lovers.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.180]   We probably haven't mentioned Butler,
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.860]   which predated quick silver.
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:08.900]   It's Peter Moore, or Rode it.
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.060]   It's now, I think somebody's taken it over from him.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.740]   It's now at manytricks.com.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.660]   Still free though, although they say,
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.860]   if you want to donate, you're welcome to.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.700]   And it is basically like quick silver,
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.900]   in the same sense you press control space
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.860]   and type the first few letters.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.220]   Has a lot of nice features though,
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:30.260]   and including a menu bar modification,
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:31.820]   so you can put a Google search,
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.780]   or any search tool in your menu bar.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.380]   You can also put bookmarks in your menu bar,
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.580]   which put them right where you want them.
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.740]   You can scan your volumes and your applications
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.860]   and your system preferences and your music
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.540]   right through the menu bar, which is great.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:48.100]   Also, it keeps multiple clipboards.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.660]   And I think sometimes quick silver is a little opaque.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.380]   It's a little hard to figure out
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.500]   how to do what you want to do,
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.260]   or what it can even do.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.580]   - You think?
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.860]   - Which is good for Merlin.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.780]   - No, you're totally right, it's completely opaque.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.900]   - But they've done a nice job in Butler of,
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.220]   when you go to the configuration window,
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:09.140]   it actually explains what everything is,
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.900]   and says, this is what you would change to do this.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.860]   It's probably similarly opaque,
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.940]   but I think maybe a little bit more easy to use.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.020]   - It's very friendly, very friendly looking.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.860]   And the thing is, everybody's always wanting
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.140]   to make these into competitions,
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.260]   which to me is useless.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.340]   It's like choosing what kind of silverware you're gonna buy.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.260]   I mean, as long as you can eat your food with it,
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:30.180]   like who cares.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.100]   But it's very well done.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.220]   By the way, mini tricks, I believe that's Peter's company.
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.940]   - That's a, - Okay, so he's still doing it.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.540]   Good. - No, that's a terrific app.
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.580]   I mean, God, if you, if he's one of the best programmers,
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.660]   Mac programmers out there,
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.980]   I mean, he's just really Peter and Merlin.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.380]   - If you're in a situation where you get to choose
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.540]   between Quicksilver, LaunchBar, and Butler,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.820]   like you have the right kind of problem.
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:47.660]   - Right.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.500]   - They're all fantastic.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.900]   - We have mentioned another Peter Moore program.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.820]   I think probably not on Mac break weekly,
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:54.460]   but on Mac break called Witch.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.460]   And I know you use that, WITCH,
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.740]   which allows you to alt tilde through windows
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.460]   in the same way you alt tab through applications.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.340]   That's really handy to have.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.740]   The only reason I tried Butler is because, you know,
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.660]   I have this air and I thought,
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.420]   well, maybe I should try LaunchBar,
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.980]   launch, you know, try LaunchBar again.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:11.740]   And I paid for LaunchBar, so I still have a license to it.
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.700]   And Butler again, and compare him to a Quicksilver.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.020]   And I have to, I really like Butler.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.700]   I think it really does a nice job.
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.460]   I'm using it on the air and actually I liked it so much.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:22.780]   I said, I might try it on the MacBook too.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.380]   So it is a, the only issue is on a laptop,
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.660]   you need a lot of menu real estate
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.420]   if you're gonna use all the little menu doohickeys.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:34.020]   You might find that with a limited menu bar on a laptop,
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:34.860]   you don't have enough space.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.060]   But on the 30 inch display, plenty of space
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.380]   for all those doohickeys.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:41.980]   Butler, B-U-T-L-E-R, it's from manytricks.com.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.820]   And it is free.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.540]   And I'm glad Peter's still developing it
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.620]   because it works well with the leopard.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.900]   I haven't tried WITCH with leopard.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.460]   I don't know if it still works or not.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.340]   I would imagine it does.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.700]   He keeps his stuff up today.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:59.100]   Okay, gentlemen, anything else to add?
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.620]   Any burning issues, pressing issues?
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.900]   I just like to remind our listeners,
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.420]   we saw something come from the net
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.940]   that I think is important as people look at the EULA
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.820]   within their iTunes in quick time.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.860]   They go down to number 10,
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.260]   there's a thing in export control.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.940]   And I just want to remind them that according to Apple,
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.020]   you also agree that you will not use these products
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.060]   for any purposes prohibited by the United States law,
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.500]   including without limitation,
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.100]   the development design, manufacturer,
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.540]   or production of missiles
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.300]   or nuclear chemical or biological weapons.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.060]   Right on, Daddy-O, but automatic weapons, no problem.
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.220]   This is why I'm switching to Ubuntu.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.060]   I want to be on a platform where I can put,
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.260]   okay, my Lily Allen song on a missile.
[01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.540]   And if I can't do that, you know?
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.900]   Free as in free beer, free missiles.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.940]   Liberty.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.100]   I just thought that was a...
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.980]   I probably thought the Second Amendment should be extended
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.260]   not only for the right to bear arms,
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.660]   but the right to bear technology.
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.020]   That yes, in the long run,
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:55.020]   if we ever get a repressive government
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.100]   that tries to shut us down,
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.700]   it ain't gonna be a gun that we're gonna fight them with.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.220]   You can have my episode of Monk
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.700]   when you appeal it for my gold knife.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.140]   (laughing)
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.580]   That note, another Mac Break is broke!
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:21.760]   (upbeat music)
