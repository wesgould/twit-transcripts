[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly. I am Scott Bournfilling in for Leo the Port and
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960]   this is episode number four.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   [Music]
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.400]   Joining me this week on Mac Break Weekly we have Kenji Kato from Pixel Core
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.680]   Mr. Chris Breen from Macworld, Hi Chris. Hi Scott.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.280]   And Merlin Mann from 43folders.com one of the most popular blogs in the world. Hi Marilyn.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.960]   How's it going Scott? Good and joining us for the first time on Mac Break Weekly is digital
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.360]   photography expert and aperture author extraordinaire Mr. Ben Long. First up it seems like the world
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.600]   is shifting. Dr. Eric Schmidt from Google is joining Apple's board of directors Kenji what is going
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.680]   on? That's a good question you know Apple's got some interesting people on their board of directors
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.400]   and this is an interesting move in some ways. I mean you've got people like Al Gore already
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.640]   on their board of directors but this one seems like an interesting synergy could potentially be
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.400]   that Google not post something going on or is it that they're just looking for a high-powered
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.840]   person for the board? It's hard to say right now. Is it possible that this is an alliance against
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.960]   Microsoft? Potentially I mean you've got Google they've got their video they've got all their
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.040]   search information you know they've got potentially all this dark bandwidth they've got all these
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.920]   different things going on the background and whether you see them up front or not and
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.320]   it will be interesting to see how he affects Apple and the direction that things go. I mean
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.480]   typically it doesn't look the board has much direction control day to day on Apple. We'll see if he
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.520]   if it has so many kind of influence. Let me bring Chris Breen in for Macworld Magazine Chris
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.600]   this kind of took me by surprise did you get any inkling of this before it was announced?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.080]   No I didn't but I'm not sure that he's going to have a lot of influence just like most of the
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.720]   other board members don't have a lot of influence. If you look at Apple they've got Al Gore on the
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.960]   board and yet there's been a report recently that Apple's environmental policies are not exactly
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.080]   sterling so it's not like Al is pulled Steve aside and said you know I think we need to be a greener
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.760]   company and then they've got the head of the quick and folks on there and quick in 2007 just
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   came out for the Mac and it's not universal binary and so you sort of look at these sort of decisions
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.520]   with these people on the board you wonder how much influence they really have in day-to-day
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.680]   operations. Well from what I understand nobody has any influence in Apple other than Steve Jobs so
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.920]   probably not a big deal but it does cause one to ponder the possibilities with all these alliances
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   being framed around potential competition for Microsoft we'll see what happens. I want to keep
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.040]   things moving with you Chris there is a new tool for streaming the contents of your iTunes library
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.080]   from one computer to another and you know something about it because you're the master at playlist
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.920]   mag in addition to Macworld what can you tell us about music cast? Well music cast is a new software
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.280]   application from Andrew Kuzmierski and Mark Davis and Andrew actually invented a delicious library
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.400]   as a kid and this is an $18 application that lets you share your iTunes library via web browser. Now
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.240]   this stuff exists in other forms there's a windows utility that allows you to stream your music from
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   an iPod across the web and there are other ways to share your music but what this does is it sort
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.560]   of strips away the pretense it allows you to easily not only share your iTunes library but also
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.200]   copy music from other people's iTunes libraries onto your computer it's all web based the application
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.960]   is really simple to set up basically you're just opening a port in your router that allows people
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.440]   to be able to see what's on your computer you can either have them sign in and tell you who they
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.120]   are or not they can come in anonymously. What they're trying to do is kind of intersect music
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.960]   sharing and social networking the only problem is that a lot of this material is copyrighted and of
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.880]   course the RIAA is not going to be happy about that and Apple may have something to say about it because
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.520]   you're using the iTunes interface and they definitely do not want you to be able to swap music back
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.040]   and forth across the web via their libraries. By the way I predicted this product and company
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.600]   will last about 12.3 seconds. Well they've managed to make it 24 hours and that was 22 hours more than
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.520]   I thought because so far that I haven't heard that they've gotten the call from Apple or the RIAA.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.120]   The difficulty is that it's not that this is impossible to do it's just more difficult to do
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.800]   using other tools so it's all just a matter of sharing data across a network at what point does
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.440]   somebody come in and stop it. Now again I think Apple has a chance because they're using the iTunes
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.520]   interface and they've been successful in the past and stopping people from using it but there are
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.560]   other ways to do this. So I guess the moral of the story is go to musiccast.org tonight and hope it's
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.360]   still there. Give it a try. It really is a very nice piece of software and if somebody tells
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.960]   if Apple or the RIAA tells them to cut it out who knows maybe it'll go open source but you just
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.440]   can't stop this stuff that the genie is out of the bottle and people want to do this sort of thing
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.560]   and are going to find a way. Well Merlin Mann you know about a piece of software that does something
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.480]   not quite as revolutionary as musiccast but that does allow you to move video to your iPod video.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.640]   It's a program called I-Squint. Why don't you talk about that? Yeah absolutely. Actually I played
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.600]   around a little bit with that musiccast today and it is very similar to this I-Squint in some ways.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.840]   Yeah so I-Squint you know you look at everybody who's out there buying their video I-Pods and they're
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:12.680]   so hungry for new content and I-Squint is a video converter. It pic takes like AVIs or M-Pods or
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.560]   you know DivX or any kind of almost any kind of non-DRM movie format and very easily turns it into
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.120]   iPod video and then can just kind of shunted straight over on your iPod for you and you know
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.360]   there's been tools like this out there before like FFmpegX there's been a whole bunch of tools
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.600]   like this but this one is just so drop that simple and for the kind of personality that loves the
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.640]   simplicity of an iPod this is a real super fast easy way to do this. So tell me I've got a DVD could
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.800]   I take this piece of software and move the DVD onto my iPod video? I think you need some pretty
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.120]   extensive Russian middleware in order to do that. This is really more for oh gosh I don't know if
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.040]   you've got pictures of your kids hitting you in the genitals with a baseball bat or your cat
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.480]   falling off of a couch this is an easy way to take those AVIs and just scoot them over. Nice thing is
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.800]   it has a cue so you can grab five or ten of these throw them in and then when you wake up in the
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.640]   morning all this stuff is all moved over for you. Interesting and another thing that's really been
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.560]   shooting up the charts on Dig and Delicious is something called TubeSock. Have you guys seen this
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.120]   yet? Yeah I've used it it's great. It's hilarious so it takes this concept of the way Icewind works
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.640]   and basically you can point it at any YouTube video and it will transform that from that dot
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.480]   FOV format into an iPod movie format and move it over onto your iPod for you. Kenji what about
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:38.840]   the ability to take stuff like the DVDs we buy and move it into these kinds of software?
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.960]   How much trouble are people having doing that? It's not necessarily straightforward and if you're
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   trying to just do it in a you know straightforward bashing manner there are other apps out there to
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.640]   do that. The guys that do Icewind have some other apps out there I think they were the same ones who
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:02.840]   did Handbrake Lite which lets you basically just drag a DVD on and pull it off into a iPod ready
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.280]   format. Well Merlin you're well known for being a guy that's sort of an efficiency expert where the
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.880]   web is concerned. Do you think we need to continue to see these software programs get easier and
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.360]   easier and easier before this stuff is really adopted on a wide scale? Yeah I think several
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.240]   things would have to happen. I mean I've just for purely experimental purposes looked at some of
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.080]   these applications and they're not all intuitively easy to use and they require a lot of disk space.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.240]   I mean if you want to have a big collection of ripped DVDs you're going to need some serious
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.160]   hard drive space and then in terms of trading and stuff like that you know you need some serious
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.840]   bandwidth so for the Garden variety user these are not going to be this is not anything huge to
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.600]   worry about but I think it was Chris that said it earlier you know the genie's out of the bottle
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.640]   with this stuff you know in a lot of ways well I mean I want to be a dead horse here but there's
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.560]   a lot of business opportunities here that people like Apple need to be looking at because people
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   are so hungry for this content and providing an easy way for them to grab this stuff and throw
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.640]   it on an iPod is you know you're just leaving money on the table. Speaking of a dead horse associations
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.920]   like the RIAA who by the way would sue their own mother if they caught him playing a Garth
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.120]   Brooke some twice in a row without a license I think these people while purporting to represent
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.760]   the interest of the content creators have probably done more to keep money out of their pockets than
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.000]   any pirate ever has. I completely agree I mean this is a little off topic but I think a lot of
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.080]   these companies and organizations are just treading water until they can figure out what the next
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.840]   step is for making money and you know nobody's ever gotten rich by suing their customers that
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:43.080]   I'm aware of maybe they have a plan for that. Well let's keep moving we've been talking about
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:49.080]   applications it seems like a theme in this week's show and Ben you're a hiker and a photographer
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:55.880]   those two go well together and you're a GPS user I am too and I have been frustrated with my inability
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   to get my Garmin GPS to work with a PC you found some new stuff that will work with a Mac what did
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.480]   you find? Well Scott there of course the Garmin GPS is shipped with Windows only software which
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   has been really annoying for us Mac users who have Garmin GPS's there are a couple of new products
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.840]   oil and one new product and one slightly older product they're not so great for hiking
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:25.240]   but for navigating cities they let you use your GPS with your Mac the first is route buddy which
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.840]   is from a British company just started shipping a couple weeks ago you can find it at routebuddy.com
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.160]   and it lets you use your GPS in conjunction with maps that they provide inside of the route buddy
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.760]   software to track your position as you move around town you see a live map on your Mac and
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.360]   transfer waypoints and do all your tracking data that way. Well if Alex Lindsay was here he'd be
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:54.440]   screaming about his Tom Tom about now which I still marvel at considering the fellow doesn't
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   own an automobile but for hiking did you find anything that does work? Well the problem with
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.320]   hiking is you want to take some of the cool mapping data that's out there and dump it into your GPS
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:11.000]   so that you can see the actual little live map on your GPS screen if you're a Windows user that's
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.680]   what the Garmin software does and Garmin sells some incredible mapping data for a very reasonable
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.440]   price they sell topo maps of the entire country they sell really high res topo maps of all the
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.320]   national parks they're claiming that they're going to have a Mac version of the software available by
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.040]   the end of the year they claimed that before so who knows if that will really happen. However with
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.720]   bootcamp and parallels we now have another option and I've actually been using the Garmin
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:43.640]   maps or software from within parallels and it works fine but with a with a GPS that actually has a
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.680]   USB adapter I can run it through parallels and move all my map data to transfer all my waypoints
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.680]   and that kind of thing. From a hiking and photography perspective you know there are some other
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.520]   products out there that are people have announced that will let you take your GPS and record locations
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.600]   and then tag your photos with them none of those are shipping yet although Sony does have
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.960]   something they call the Sony GPS tracker for photographers which is a little
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.000]   and a GPS dongle thing that's supposed to allow you to just come and understand.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.960]   I really don't understand why this can't simply be built into most of the digital SLRs it's not
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.320]   that big a deal and it's a perfect use for a camera you take a picture you click a button you put a
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:30.040]   GPS waypoint there it's one of those the moments for me I really wish that the camera manufacturers
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.600]   would start thinking a little bit outside the traditional limits of film based photography
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.160]   because they've got all this capability there they're just not using it. Well Nikon is inside
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.840]   in one of their cameras nothing. Yeah the Nikon D200 will do that actually you can hook a GPS in
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:50.360]   and as you're shooting your photos it actually if you got GPS hooked in it will record the GPS
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.880]   information into the XF data. And I do think that's cool but what I think needs to happen beyond that
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.640]   is you simply need to have the ability to record that waypoint right on top of the photograph so
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.600]   that you don't have to have your GPS hooked up. Right like the newer like Verizon cell phones
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.520]   you've got a small GPS chip in there and you can walk around with your Verizon phone and use it as a
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.120]   full guiding or guidance system. Yeah that would be the same with the camera. That would be fun.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.720]   One of the nice things about route buddies it gives you a GPS interface to Google Maps and Google
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:29.320]   Earth after route buddy has identified your location and shown you on its little map you can then say
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.480]   okay go show me where I am on Google Earth and then we'll put you right at that spot which is kind
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.360]   of a cool and navigating Google Earth environment. That's very cool. And Ben how does that work on a
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:46.600]   cruise ship? I wouldn't know I was below decks the whole time. This is a reference to the
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:52.440]   geek cruises that both Ben and Chris have been on. Chris I want to talk about what we're doing
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.880]   right now because one of the emails that I get most often around hosting and being on these
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.320]   podcasts is from people who want to know how we're pulling this off. Right now we have folks in
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:10.200]   several cities talking to each other without the use of telephones over computers using Skype
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.720]   and we record the Skype signal to create Mac break weekly and several of the other shows that a
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.600]   bunch of us are on. Let's talk a little bit about that because you wrote up a famous Chris
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:28.040]   Breen Mac 9-1-1 piece about this in case anybody doesn't know Mac 9-1-1 is Chris's answer to Leo's
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   call for help. Right in my own little area of the Mackerel website in Mackerel magazine.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.800]   Yeah because I happen in a lot of these podcasts lately and more and more people are using Skype
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.440]   and if you were actually behind the scenes participating in some of these things you'd realize what a
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:53.160]   pain in the next Skype can be. A lot of times people can get dumped off the line or you get these weird
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:00.040]   echoes or just things sound funny and so people have been looking for some kind of solution
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.160]   to get around Skype. It's really pretty good for a one-on-one conference but once you start adding
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:12.200]   more bodies to the conference it gets more difficult. So I was talking about alternate solutions and
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.280]   one of those is that I've seen people using now is you actually talk by a reliable means and that
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.720]   can be phone or iChat if that works or some other voice over IP client or Skype if you prefer to do
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.400]   it that way but on each member's end you're actually recording your own conversation so you're not
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.200]   having to go through Skype to record anything but rather each individual records with an audio
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.120]   editor on their machine and when you're done then you send the done file to whoever's host these
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:46.360]   things. So for example Scott would be editing this one we'd all record our bits, send it off to Scott
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.160]   and he would line them up and the way you do that is at the beginning of the broadcast the
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.680]   moderator says okay everybody on the count of three one two three and then you all clap
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.840]   which puts a big audio spike in the middle that and Scott have you actually done this before?
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.680]   I have we record TWIM this way this week in media which is another podcast that I'm involved in and
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.760]   the Kenji's involved in and we do it a little bit differently each person gets on and says their name
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.440]   and then says three two one and then each person successively does the same thing and then we just
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:24.120]   line up all the three two ones in succession and it it works the same way. Yes I hard do you find
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.040]   to edit it that way? It's not hard at all as soon as you get everybody's three two one figured out
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.480]   the rest of it flows together very nicely and the reason we don't use it for some of the
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.440]   podcasts is that it does require some extra equipment you've got to have a microphone
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.440]   you've got to have a way to get the microphone into your computer and it is a little bit more
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   technical for some of the guests that we have that aren't maybe that savvy so we use the Skype
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.520]   alternative but having had some of these nightmarish experiences you've discussed I agree that it
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.800]   might be a very good alternative. I was going to say you also were on the risk of if six people are
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.680]   on a call in that fashion you might get five perfect tracks and then one person who forgot to
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.040]   hit record and you kind of have wasted the time of six people that goes wrong for one person.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.160]   Right yeah I think in that case you can do the Skype backup so at least you have that to fall
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:23.640]   back on and also as you as you indicate Scott if you have guests who are not technically savvy or
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.720]   you don't want to put them through the trouble of that it is a lot to ask somebody to say oh by the
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.880]   way would you mind recording your end and sending it to me some people don't have that kind of time
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.720]   they just need to get it done and get off the phone so that leaves you with Skype.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.360]   Of course you realize our opportunity to get a Skype sponsorship is pretty much out the window
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.680]   as a result of this segment. We're just offering gentle encouragement. It is really quite fantastical
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.720]   that we can even do what we're doing and on sort of a Dick Tracy watch kind of level I do think
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.160]   it's very cool but it isn't acceptable and what we usually do in a broadcast setting is we'll use
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.320]   what's called a digital telephone hybrid to record people over the telephone the problem is if you
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.600]   have a group of people like we have here you have to find a reliable telephone conference line
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.560]   which is sometimes about as hard to do as finding a reliable Skype connection.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:20.680]   Merlin you proposed an interesting question to me today and that was would the next
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:28.520]   Mac stores be in airports. Yeah I stole this idea from a Macworld web blog post by Philip Michaels
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.680]   and I guess it all started with him being in a situation that we've probably all been in at one
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.880]   time or another where you forget the cord for your camera or I'm forever leaving my power supply
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.840]   for my Macbook in various hotel rooms and he just was saying this seems like an interesting
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.240]   business opportunity for Apple what if they started having sort of these small stores or large kiosks
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.680]   inside of major airports. I mean you got people buying iPods left and right and I thought that
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.600]   was just kind of a neat idea and I wanted to hear what other folks might have thought of that idea as
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:05.400]   well because I'm from Macworld and that Phil has occasional oversight on my work I think it's a
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   brilliant idea. No I should do. Phil and Skype we love them both. I do I love both of them. No I
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.440]   really do like the idea. I think when iTunes eventually becomes the movie store there's even
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.600]   more potential here imagine being at the airport and being able to jack your iPod into a movie key
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.680]   ask for example and download one of 100 movies they've made available to you for like $9.99
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:37.720]   or if you don't have an iPod cool look there's this $199 video iPod that you could buy take with
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.640]   you and it's loaded up with a couple of TV series samples and then you can add movies to it after
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:50.520]   that so I like the idea of there being portable media as well as gear having the camera cables
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.520]   great having a power supply is great kind of the biggest hits of the stuff you're likely to leave
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.520]   behind but also something that you can load your iPod with would be great. Given the fact that we
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.360]   all now have to be at the airport 7.5 early hours earlier than our flight it would probably be cool
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   just to be able to browse Mac gear the problem I think this idea is going to run into is I absolutely
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:19.080]   with all my heart believe we're moving to a non-carry-on event someday in the future with airplanes and
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.760]   that's going to kill any kind of retail at the airports. Well that's why I want the implantable iPod.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:31.080]   Well the other thing the other point that I think Phil was making in this that I think is smart is
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.120]   it's also about proximity where if you're like a friend of mine just took off for Ireland and
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.560]   left his uh his power books power supply here so where's he gonna go he's not familiar with
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.880]   doubling he doesn't know where to go to find that but if you knew that you could go into the airport
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.600]   and no straight where to go to get it you know it wouldn't you know just applying kind of 80-20 rule
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.760]   you could have a pretty pretty good amount of stuff that most users could need in a pretty
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.480]   small footprint whether or not they could carry it on. Yeah I think it's a great idea I just don't
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.120]   think in the future they're going to let us carry anything on in fact the only reason that they're
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:12.840]   not making us go on nude is that they've seen me naked. Speaking of iPods and before we get into
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.560]   something that causes to lose our clean tag uh Chris there is a changing landscape when it comes to
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:26.440]   digital music players there's been a lot of buzz about Microsoft's zoom and of course we heard
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:33.560]   recently about then this is not much of a surprise to me the Dell Diddy taking a dump and dying
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.000]   lots of D's in that sentence what do you know about all that? Well yeah they'll discontinue the DJ
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.400]   Diddy because one no buzz uh well maybe the music player made a buzz but there was no buzz about
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.440]   the music player there was no good way to market the thing because even though Dell does very well
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.840]   online with their computers people don't go to Dell looking for a music player because they get an
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.920]   iPod instead and the other thing that's sort of been failing with all these music players is that
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.600]   there's no good integration with the music service whereas the iPod and iTunes are a beautiful match
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.360]   you get any sort of third party music player that has to use a Windows system and you go through
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   these sort of cluji interfaces or you go through Windows media player which has just way too much
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:23.080]   stuff in it even you know iTunes is a fairly comprehensive program as well but it seems easier
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.720]   to get around it whereas Windows media player seems like they've got everything in there plus a
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.960]   little more and then just a little more to make it more complicated and then you try to jack a
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:37.800]   music player into it as well and get your media onto the player and it's just an unholy mess so
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   that hasn't benefited Dell and and many of the third parties what about the zoom have you heard
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.160]   today's reports that it's not everything it's cracked up to be well actually it's everything
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:56.040]   that a Toshiba 1098 is cracked up to be because that's what it is it's a Toshiba 1098 music player
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:02.120]   basically it's a 30 gigabyte hard drive FM two and earth three it's screen you can share music
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.480]   supposedly with up to four other people who have these things it's made out of plastic it's 300
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:13.080]   bucks but there are a few problems with it one the click wheel isn't a click wheel instead it's
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.760]   just a round interface with buttons on it so there's no real scroll wheel on there the wireless
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.120]   capabilities sound cool but it actually requires that somebody else within the hailing distance of
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.840]   you owns one of these things so you know if you don't sell a bunch of them you're the one person
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.120]   standing around with the zoom saying hey anybody want to share with me and they're all listening to
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:40.680]   their ipods going loser and then that they said integration problem again so this is just another
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:47.480]   windows kind of mp3 player and if there's not a good service if Microsoft isn't offering something
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.200]   as compelling as iTunes then you've got a not so great player working with a not so great music
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:59.720]   service and what why buy it Merlin what's it going to take for somebody to crack the ipods
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.760]   dominance and I do mean dominance of this space you know I really have no idea it's
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.960]   I oscillate between these two poles on the one hand I think well gosh you know I really want
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.880]   devices that do one thing really well I mean more and more people I know are out there now buying
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.040]   a phone that's just a phone and they don't want to do all these things I just got a trio and it plays
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.680]   music and I I don't want any of that stuff you know it so I mean on the one hand there's this
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.440]   interesting convergence devices that are doing all this stuff really well and then you know I
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.480]   think Chris put it really well I mean the ipod just works so well with with the Mac and
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:37.000]   it still amazes me that I go out and I buy a new camera or I buy a new printer and I plug it in
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.320]   and the icon pops up and I've been on Mac since 1987 and that still amazes me so I mean if you
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:49.640]   can get that kind of lockstep integration you know people get really attached yeah I think until
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   you get something that competes with the iTunes music story it doesn't matter what your player
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.800]   looks like I say it over and over and over again it's all in the iTunes music store
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.320]   unless it hooks up to the iTunes music store you'll never sell it
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:08.040]   let's move on Kenji I want you and I to cover this because you know I don't know anything about
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:15.320]   hacking and I'm sure you don't but we can both talk about this the Mac book hack controversy
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:23.240]   turns out to be wait for it a hoax yeah it wasn't real yeah there's been a lot of reports
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:29.320]   circulating around about this if you got to see the original video where they were talking about
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:38.440]   how they used a I think it was a Dell laptop to hack into a a MacBook wirelessly the system they
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.800]   hacked into was supposed to be using a third-party wireless card using a third-party driver on this
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:54.040]   Mac book it's turning out that this probably was a faked or at least a very crafted demonstration
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:01.160]   to make it look like these guys had some information about hacking into other systems wirelessly
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:07.720]   the bottom line was they pretended to hack into a MacBook and that would be based on everybody's
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.840]   traditional MacBook user experience which is to rely on the wireless that comes with the MacBook
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.760]   and what they actually did was work through a third-party card so it was no big deal yeah and
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:24.440]   I mean if they had hacked it through the built-in wireless and it kind of put up how they done that
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.800]   I think it would have been more credence but they didn't do that you know it's it's becoming very
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:36.120]   clear that this probably was kind of a hoax or a total fake kind of situation you guys think that
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:42.920]   Apple's beating its chest lately via its new commercials about its ability to avoid viruses
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:49.160]   and such as inviting these sorts of attacks it's a good question uh didn't David Polk's thing in the
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:55.480]   New York Times this week he had a kind of an inspired rant about a Gruber-esque rant about
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:01.400]   the idea that Macs actually really are more secure than it isn't simply a matter of you know the
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   virus writers are looking for the biggest market out there um and I mean I don't have enough
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:11.720]   insight to say whether that's accurate or not but it's I don't know I mean are we getting 5%
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:18.120]   of the viruses that are out there it doesn't seem like it no in fact I don't get any viruses thank
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.640]   you very much because I don't have parallels or bootcamp on my MacBook Pro but there is there's
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.840]   one that's why they hate us we you do have to be careful though because I mean I know I get into
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.120]   the habit of getting used to typing in my password because I've got my security pretty locked down
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.920]   but you get so used to typing that in habitually that you maybe don't always check what process is
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.480]   looking to change do you know what I mean yeah you get into this habit where you know if you're
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.880]   constantly entering your password it it loses the power I think we're gonna continue to see attacks
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.920]   on this level and somebody may eventually crack through the Macs and if they do all that'll end up
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   accomplishing is forcing Apple to make them better well and I think that the one area which
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.760]   kind of gets overlooked sometimes is just general Wi-Fi security I mean even though this situation
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.800]   of hacking into a MacBook remotely using another system is looking like it's probably fake
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:17.960]   general Wi-Fi security people don't always realize that you know using a web password or
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:24.360]   Mac filtering is not secure I mean if you look at some of the Wi-Fi software even on a Macintosh
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   you can scan pretty easily past web and Mac filtering Kenji also want to talk about Intel's
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.680]   new chip how do you say this Merum I think so Merum unless somebody else wants to anybody else
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:45.000]   buy that yeah their new chip Intel announced on Monday is the new basically Core 2 Duo which
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.960]   people kind of been waiting for and it's looking like it's a pretty cool chip now this is the new
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:58.120]   version of the chip that we've already seen the Core Duo this is the Core 2 Duo now my first
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:04.920]   question is why not call it the Core Duo 2 good questions someone someone the marketing might want
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.960]   to rethink the way they're naming stuff so I've I've read that it is much faster but it does require
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:18.840]   more power which immediately gets me concerned about that little hot spot in my MacBook Pro getting
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.920]   even hotter well I think they announced not just their high-end one but also a lower performance
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:31.720]   lower end chip that was actually designed for notebooks specifically so instead of I think the
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:40.840]   2.16 gigahertz to 2.33 gigahertz range it's a 1.8 gigahertz chip designed for notebooks will
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:47.640]   we see enough performance boost there to justify that over the existing 2.16 core duo that we have
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.440]   now I think tests will have to be done and we'll see then whether this is really going to give us
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.560]   that performance boost that people are expecting it will Chris Breen do you have any inside information
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:06.040]   on this not a smidgen not a smidgen well if you don't know then nobody knows I have seen the test
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   they did on the PCs and they said that the gaming performance was actually somewhat slower I found
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:18.520]   that interesting I think it's a 64 bit chip versus 32 bit now someone might want to correct me on
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.480]   that if I'm wrong but that could be part of the reason why you're seeing a slowdown potentially so
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:29.960]   well at least they continue to develop new stuff and we'll always look forward to getting the newest
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.640]   thing you know the joke is you go to the max door and you walk in and you say I want to see the new
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.280]   MacBook Pro and the guy goes no you don't you go no no I want to see the new MacBook Pro really
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.080]   guy no no you don't yes I want to see the new MacBook Pro he goes no you want to see the next new
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:54.680]   MacBook Pro well we've covered a lot of ground for this show lots of stuff happening and before we go
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.400]   just want to ask everybody to tell me what's going on Chris Breen what do you got going on where can
