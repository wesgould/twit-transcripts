[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.640]   We're less than a month away from the announcement. Let's see what people think is going to happen next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   and in this, the vacuum preceding the Apple news, the Apple rumor.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times looking sharp.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   Hi, Andrew. Hello, Leo.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   So this is the last time we could make comments regarding the Brick House set studio.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   This is it. I'll explain in a moment. Renee Richie also here from iMore.com,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   host of the brand new Apple Talk podcast, which is Marvie.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   Oh, thank you so much. Marvie, Marvie, Marvie.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   I taught almost every, my childhood dreamlily. I've caught almost every Spider-Man villain.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Wow, look at that.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   Wow, you've got a 2000 Pokemon.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   Oh, see, the Pokemon are okay, but I just, I managed to name them all after Spider-Man villains,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.960]   and that makes me incredibly happy.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960]   You just, you just a sad, sad, sad.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   I know. There's a few things in life to lovely.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   It's, it's one, it's one thing when you wish to do something that makes you like a nerdy social outcast.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   But when you realize that, wait a minute, there are 50 or 60 nerdy social outcasts here in this park.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   I need to make myself a nerdy outcast.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   I need to stand out of the, of the nerdy.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   The nerdiest of the nerds.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   It says, at least I'm not a him.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   Jesus.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   Right and nerdy.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Actually, we were in San Diego on Thursday and Friday, and Pokemon fever has hit these,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   the, what do you call San Diego? The city of the city that never changes weather.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   The city that never changes weather. The city of Diego.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   There's a, we were in Coronado, and there's a kind of like a median strip with grass,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   and I thought I couldn't, we drove by and I thought, what's going on?
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   And I realized, oh, they're all, they're all going like this.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   And then that night we came back because there's three Poke stops or four,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   no, there's four Poke stops with lures and a gym in a very small area.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   The Golden Square.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   And then we came back after we went to see a play and after the play about 10, 10, 30,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   we're coming back and it's like, I, it's like woodstock.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   You can't even drive the, they're spilling into the street.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   They're shoulder to shoulder. It was incredible.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   I was at a park and this very nice old man came up and he goes,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   if you want to get better at that, just go to I'm more.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   There's this woman serenity called.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   Every trick yet.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   Absolutely.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   Oh my God.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   I thank you very much for the advice.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   It was the nicest thing I'd heard.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.960]   Oh my God.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   You didn't say I'm her boss.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   No.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   I mean, he's just like, I'm awesome.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   Isn't that a wonderful moment?
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   Oh, I don't, I don't want to, I mean, this, I, I'm your friends.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   I, I'm your friends, why I should say this.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   You didn't realize it was me.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   I came up just jokingly and then without looking up, you said,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   yeah, she's great.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   She's wonderful.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   Get out of my way.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   And I'm like, oh, there's a pic or two around the corner.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Hey, I got, I got my minds on Magneto.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   He was out catching with his daughter.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   They were doing some family time.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   So, uh, we are now in that state, uh, that sad and lonely state.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   Two of them actually.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   One, this is probably the last time you will see us in this studio looking this purple.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   The purple lights are going.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   If you're watching video that, uh, this is relatively intact, although the rest of the
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   studio is slowly disappearing in front of my eyes.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   But what's behind me is relatively intact, but only really for a few days more.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   We, we are building a new studio, as you know.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   In fact, Carson, do you have the picture of them?
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   Uh, uh, I like to check in to make sure they're not playing Pokemon Go.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   Uh, they are, they are putting glue on the floor with the carpet tiles that it looks
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   small.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   It is not that small.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   You can see the lighting rig over there.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   It's actually the same size as our existing studio.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   Can I say, wouldn't you love to have a job like that where your work is in itself,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   your own progress bar?
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   Ah, only 48% more.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   That's great.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   That's awesome.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   Uh, so there, uh, there it is, and we will be moving there.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   And you know, there'll be this interregnum between today and sometime in the year 2018,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   where it will be a little unfinished here and there.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   Like this gear behind me is this, what do you, what did you call that?
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   Andy there?
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   The cog.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   The cog will be removed, I believe, from the wall sometime between now and the next
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   Mac break quickly.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   We'll do one more Mac break.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   Uh, and then we will be moving, moving to the studio.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   And there, uh, you know, you'll see the operation in the reverse.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   It will start looking pretty ratty and then I hope, when hopes get better and better,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   bit by bit.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   However, that is not the, the vacuum I was referring to.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   I'm referring to the calm before the storm.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Here we are, August 9th.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   Pretty certain there will be an Apple event sometime in the next 30 days.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   Mm hmm.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.960]   Pretty certain there will be a new iPhone or two announced.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   Um, and the rumor is that the phone is not going to be a little bit too late.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   And the rumor mill is going hot and heavy.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   I mean, we're seeing, we're seeing more people who purportedly have actual hardware.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   And that's, and more people who are willing to actually share photos of what they
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   report to be actual hardware.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   And yes, 30 days before what we expect to be an event is the time where we start to
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   start to take that stuff a little bit more seriously because this is the time where
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   they're, they've got enough, they've got things ramped up and they've got so many
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   people briefed in that there is no, no godly way that you can keep a lid on, on what's
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960]   going on.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:07.360]   So we can kind of trust or relatively, I mean, you know, even with the Samsung note seven
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.600]   when they announced it last week, there were at least two items where the rumor mill got
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   it completely wrong.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   So it is still possible.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.440]   One of the, we can tell you what is going into various stages of the product and tell
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.880]   you exactly which feature might be in which model, but the most importantly, I can't tell
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   you the story.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.120]   What the Apple has never really been about the chip sets.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.200]   It's about the feature sets.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.760]   And so it's got these two lenses and it sounds like one of those lenses is a black and white
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.320]   one to increase low sensitivity.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.160]   But what is that really going to deliver with the camera and how are they going to tell
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   us about it?
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   What are the results?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   How is the chip the processor?
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.680]   We know they're making an Apple A10, but what's in the guts of that chip and how is that going
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   to process and work with those lenses?
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   And that's what Phil Schiller is going to tell us on the stage.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.720]   So if we know the bits, like the rumor today was that it was going to have a 1080p screen
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   on the iPhone 7 and a 2K screen on the iPhone 7 Plus, which is a big bump in resolution
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.840]   for both devices and an actual standard, not a weird Apple 3X size or something.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.440]   But what are they going to come up to say?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.760]   The sharpest display ever?
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.080]   Are they going to say, well, it works with Google cardboard now?
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.640]   Probably as good as the Galaxy S7, things like that.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   Well, it's a case.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   And Renee is exactly right.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.600]   Really when you consider that the CPU on an iPhone is part of pretty much every feature
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.880]   on that phone.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.800]   So you can't really talk about the camera unless you talk about the CPU.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.000]   You can't really talk about the display unless you talk about the CPU networking.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Everything feeds into the CPU.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.040]   It's always interesting when you think about what sensor is going to be going behind the
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.920]   new camera or what the megapixel count is going to be who's going to be supplying it.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.760]   But it really comes down to the secret sauce that Apple can create.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.960]   They can do things with the two cameras set up that probably no other device manufacturer
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.320]   can do just because they've always developed this iPhone camera with the idea that we have
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.120]   a piece of silicon that does nothing but collect data that we can then transform into
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.600]   a picture that is much better than that sensor is supposed to be able to create.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.040]   They're on the right is the purported new case.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.280]   And they've got an HDR pipeline.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.000]   All this from software through and they've got DCI P3 displays and several devices.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.960]   So an iPhone that could not only shoot in raw but shoot in HDR raw but also display
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.960]   DCI P3.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.520]   And I believe they're actually compatible with 2020.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.600]   They're almost no one has rolled that out yet.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.800]   It starts to get really interesting.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.880]   So on the surface, yeah, it's a rounded rectangle.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.600]   But a lot of the story is going to be about what they tell on that stage.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.840]   If you look at Apple's typical release cycle going back at least to the iPhone 4, every
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.360]   other year was a really radically new design.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   This is not going to be the talk that we would expect.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   So it's hard.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.960]   It gets really hard as you go forward.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.480]   We saw that with Intel too.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.320]   Intel was on TikTok but going to 14 nanometer and then going to 10 nanometers super hard
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   so they're doing TikTok.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.240]   And Apple too, it's not that they're withholding it.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.800]   It's that I wrote this in an article this week.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.720]   It's really effing hard to do the next design that they want and it's just not ready yet.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.880]   But there's a lot of stuff that is ready and you can sort of put that into this.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.600]   And when Apple does do new designs, we still call them boring.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.160]   I mean, the iPhone 5 was called boring.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   It's pretty hard.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.600]   I mean, we've kind of reached, I think, the perfect but consensus on what form factor
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   it should be.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.280]   It should be somewhere between 5 and 6 inches, you know, probably right in the middle there.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.920]   It should have a certain resolution.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.120]   It's going to have mostly glass.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.840]   Apple, one big change which I kind of welcome is even though they're going to stick with
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.360]   the home button, it's not going to be a moving.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   We hear.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   Of course, press.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.360]   Yeah, of course touch.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   It'll have a little haptic in there.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360]   Haptic in.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   I like that.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.280]   They did the same thing with the iPod remember the click wheel moved for a while.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.960]   But you want to if you're going to have a sealed phone, you don't want to have little
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.240]   crevices in there.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   And also there's mechanical failure.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.840]   I mean, the big thing is that a ground wreck boring, but then Blackberry announces a pop
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.240]   tart shape phone and everyone goes, Oh, look how innovative and and doesn't like it.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   And then nobody buys it.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   Yeah, the past.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.800]   And the people who called it innovative don't give the money back to Blackberry for making
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   the loss of people.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.160]   I think the consensus was, Oh, how sad you got me.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.840]   You gave me a pop tart.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.400]   It's you gave me a pop tart shaped phone.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.360]   We wanted a phone that we could actually use.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.000]   That's was relevant for 2016 instead of, you know, 20 2008.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Here's a triangle.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   It's innovative.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.880]   This is because of the form factor because of what you're doing with the phone.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.800]   There are form follows function eventually.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.720]   And maybe we've just reached it's like spread.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.960]   You remember that lawsuit?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.120]   It's like that you like this is the way you make a spreadsheet.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.280]   But that's the ideal way of doing it.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.920]   Also, I think that most people who want style, they're just going to put into a case anyway.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.080]   I think there is a real desire not just to protect your phone, but also to make it identifiable
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   yours.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   That's a good point.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.640]   And we're not we're not talking about to make sure you don't pick up the wrong one after
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.640]   dinner.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.160]   I'm talking about you want something that really says this is not one of the 14 million
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.360]   phones that was made yesterday.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.600]   This is Andy and not goes phone.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.400]   This is the one that has my that has my my sweat stains on it stuff.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.320]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   Are you some innovation or I mean, the headphone jack, I'm sure Apple is going to spin his
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   innovation.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.760]   I have to give credit to Steve Gibson last week right after the show.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.440]   He said, you know, there may be one thing they could do with this getting rid of the
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.760]   headphone jack that would be would make it worthwhile.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.280]   He had come up with his thought.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.160]   What if they use the fact that the iPhone now has a big battery so it could power these
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.640]   headphones a little bit better.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.880]   It has significant computational capabilities so that could be used.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.640]   What if these were noise canceling headphones people pay a premium for good noise canceling
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.440]   headphones because they have to have a microphone.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.880]   They have to have power.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.320]   They have to have some computational capabilities.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.720]   You could do all that with an iPhone with your right.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.080]   That was the latest on some of the noise canceling headphones were failing the battery was trying
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.880]   to fail after 18 months.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.920]   So yeah, maybe so this may be I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.320]   They also positive that maybe because these are wearables, you know, the thing in your
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:08.480]   ear really has access to not just, you know, motion like a pedometer, but also heart rate,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.720]   better probably than something on your wrist.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.960]   Also things more obscure things like blood oxygen and perhaps even blood pressure.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.800]   And you're now connecting not by an analog audio port, but by a data port.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.280]   So this could be sent the earpieces could be sending data back to the phone in some interesting
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   way.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.560]   So that is a, even if Apple, to me, they have to say something like that.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:38.520]   They have to give me some value for eliminating something that is frankly works and is useful.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.320]   Yeah, that's all true.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.000]   And also after the show, someone on Twitter pointed out something I hadn't really considered
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.200]   after talking about how much time I spent trying to see how many people in the world
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   are wearing wired headphones versus Bluetooth and saying that I just don't see masses of
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.160]   people wearing Bluetooth headphones out in the wild.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.360]   They say, well, how many people of the wired headphones you saw are wearing the phones
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.840]   that the headphones that came with the phone.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.080]   So if they, if Apple were to, if Apple were to delete the headphone jack, but include
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.440]   wired headphones with them, that would work with whatever port they're going to be plugged
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.600]   into, that might not be a very big deal for a lot of people.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.400]   If it is true that they buy, they use whatever came in the box and they don't tend to lose
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.240]   them or wash them.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.200]   So my, my main beef about it has always been you can make, there are a hundred really
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.800]   good ways to explain why having digital headphones that plug into the lightning port are a good
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   idea.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.960]   I still haven't heard a single good consumer positive idea that explains why you cannot
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.040]   also have a headphone jack, an analog headphone jack next to it.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   Hmm, Hmm.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.120]   Well, that's in all the things.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   This is going to be, I mean, I think we now are close enough and I said this last week
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.920]   too, that this probably is going to be what they do.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.080]   And I'm just curious at this point, how they justify it.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   Metallic blue.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.880]   Yeah, we established a long time ago that they can do it.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.400]   Like there was like the iPhone five S was a Monday magnificent phone and all the people
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   we talked to said, it's gold.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   I'm getting gold.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.920]   And then success was a great iPhone.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   It's metallic pink.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   It's a metallic pink.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.080]   I want to go just that superficial.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   I want pink.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.240]   Um, it will get improved water resistance.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.080]   You'll get a little bit more room for a battery.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.320]   You'll get, uh, I mean, there are some again, I'd be.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   I can't remember.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   I mean, I, I'm sorry.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   Well, no, but Samsung's doing it without that.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   I understand what you're saying.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   Exactly.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.720]   I think Samsung took a shot at Apple last week from their event saying, and we come with
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.440]   a headphone jack.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.640]   It'll be, I cannot wait.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.240]   I think this is going to be a very interesting conversation after the event.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.040]   By the way, uh, Renee, your best guess at the date of the event, uh, whatever the when
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.400]   the first Wednesday in September is at the sixth or the seventh or something.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   Okay.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   First Wednesday in September.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   Pretty sure.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.040]   And then 10 days later, which would be the 16th.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.560]   Mostly last year they went, they had to go an extra week.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.240]   So it'll be it's 10 days or 17 days.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   Depending on if it was last year.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.200]   If it was last year was an anomaly or not, it just depends on the supply chain.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.360]   Um, anything else, uh, redesigned antenna bands, processors faster, it always is.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.960]   Um, I love it.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.920]   I hope they do a higher res phone.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.240]   I think that that's one thing they've suffered, although it's given them great battery life,
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240]   right?
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.560]   It's only 1080p, but it goes all day.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.200]   And it was a technology they wanted because it's, it's dual domain pixels and an IPS display.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.320]   And it, if the LED is used for 3D touch, so there is, you always try to make the best
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.080]   compromise you can with the constraints you have.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.640]   If you go to OLED, they couldn't have done the 3D touch the way it was implemented.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.480]   Uh, and if you go to two higher screens, sometimes you have to start messing with how
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.520]   the sub pixels work.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.720]   So they, they got the display technology they wanted.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.520]   It was sharp enough for what they wanted, but if they will start wanting more, then they're
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.440]   going to have to, you know, the technology matures and they can do more things at a
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   better scale.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.240]   The rumors are going OLED next year.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   You don't.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.760]   It could be they just have to reengineer 3D touch.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.800]   You know, is, tell me how 3D touch is better than just long press.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.240]   Well, it might, might, might, might, might, might, my quick one is that it really allows
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.480]   you to put a lot more function without having to put a lot more clutter on the screen.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.480]   Uh, and that not only adds to simplicity, but it allows, so let's you redefine common
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.680]   parts of user interface, like just the lock screen.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.880]   The lock screen can really be that thing that you never have to drill down because you have
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.360]   the pop up menus.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   Exactly.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.760]   And also it's this, it's one of the most perfectly linear face enhancements where if you know
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.080]   it's there, it can make things so much faster once you learn how to use it.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.200]   If you don't know it's there, it will never confuse you.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.520]   It will never distract you.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.880]   You can still tap to launch whatever you want and then you know, double tap or long
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.200]   press to do whatever you want.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.320]   It doesn't interfere with anything else.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.920]   So it really is the sort of thing where if it's, if you teach people how to use it on the
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.280]   lock screen of the iPhone, then that becomes part of their vocabulary.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.800]   And then you could do things like, well, guess what?
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.720]   Now we do have this little phone.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.240]   But you could do that with long press too, right?
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.720]   Well, but it's you need to, you need to expand the vocabulary a little bit.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.040]   The hand is nice, I guess, but really long press could pop up or context menu.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.080]   It's like a deep, a deep press is immediate.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.200]   A long press is there's a pause and you don't know how long you've held.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.480]   I tell you why I say that.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.760]   A, because you want OLED, so maybe it would be you could go back to a long press, but B,
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.040]   because I have a lot of trouble.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.160]   You know, when I get conflicted is when I want to do the jiggle, jiggle, jiggle to the
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.520]   leading app, you got to go back to long press hard.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.160]   Yeah, to know, well, how, I often for I often 3D touch it instead.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.800]   It's like, yeah.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.040]   So the advantage of 3D touch is if you expand, like remember that old thing when they designed
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.200]   the Mac and the principle was that if you throw into the corner, that's the easiest motion.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.360]   That's the end of that range with 3D touch with a multi touch display pressing harder
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.120]   is just the natural extent of that range.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   So long press, you've got to time it like you said, you've got to hold it, but not too
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   long.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.440]   But 3D touch, it's the same sort of thing, but you're using force instead of time as
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.080]   a regulator for the controls.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.640]   So it lets you exactly what Andy said, stack interface elements that are less used, but
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.800]   you don't want bare, I guess they are literally buried, but you don't want to make them part
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.640]   like sub menu, be part nine, eight screens down.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.000]   You want them to be accessible, just not in your face.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.840]   And then for example, clear all notifications, we've been asking for that forever.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.240]   And now just like on the Apple Watch, you 3D touch instead of regular touch on the on
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   the delete button, it says, you want to clear all notifications.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.600]   Well, yes, yes, I do.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   And it becomes discoverable because once in a while you're excited and you'll press harder
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.240]   and something will pop up and you'll discover it and then you'll try pressing something
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.040]   hard again, it'll pop up again.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.440]   And it gives you a chance to discover all this stuff without them having to have like a
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.800]   legend of Zelda sort of explainer for every step of the way on the interface.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   All right.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   All right.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.040]   And by the way, when I do long touch, I often press hard.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.400]   That's why I'm confused, right?
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.960]   Don't you feel like if you press the elevator button to a little harder or you tap it more
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.200]   times, it'll work better?
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.120]   We know it's not true, but we still press.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   We know it's disconnected.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   We know that it's completely disconnected.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   There's nothing to do with anything.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   The elevator will get here when it does.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.580]   Any other, I guess one thing, there was a rumor for a while that might be a kind of an
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.160]   iPhone Pro that it would be all glass that now we think is not the case, right?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.320]   Next year, next year.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.340]   There's a lot, actually a lot of what we're thinking and what we're kind of extrapolating
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:20.340]   about is just the idea that there's a nice round number for an anniversary coming out
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.340]   next year.
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.340]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.340]   That's going to be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:31.780]   And for some, for some human weakness analog brain reason, we tend to think that this is
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.640]   the one that's going to be, it's going to be fused light.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.820]   It's going to be a quantum packet of light.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.860]   There's going to be no tangibility to it whatsoever.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.260]   It's just kind of, it's like, okay, but what if they're going to do something way better
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.980]   than just there's going to be a new case color involved with it.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.620]   So anytime that it seems like it's justification for people like us that we're thinking, I
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.500]   don't think that they're going to have that sort of 3D camera.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.860]   I think they're saving that for next year, the big 10th anniversary model, when for all
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.220]   we know, Apple's like, well, yeah, I guess we'll do a poster or something, but no, we're
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.020]   just going to do whatever phone you know.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.580]   The iPhone, the iPhone 7S or 10th anniversary iPhone X, I mean, like the certain things
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.580]   that sound impressive.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.580]   It's a mixed anniversary.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.580]   I have to point out because they announced the iPhone in January of 2007.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:21.780]   So January of 2017 is really the 10th anniversary, not September.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.340]   It came out in June, not September.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.780]   So I think you could just as reasonably argue that this phone is going to be the 10th anniversary
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.780]   iPhone.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.340]   It's the one we'll be using in January, 2000.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.340]   It's also the 10th model.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.580]   Like they've done this will be a 10th model.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.580]   Okay, you're right.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.580]   That's a good.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.700]   How about we just make it the 10th anniversary of the phone that we thought that Apple's
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.460]   going to be making back in August of 2016.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.780]   It has the keypad and the one we'll have the pull out and kind of the and the and the
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   style.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.900]   It's hard to remember what it was like before it came out.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.100]   I mean, we were doing this show.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.220]   I remember Scott Borne was so excited about the iPhone.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.420]   We even debated whether there was going to be an iPhone.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.020]   Apple was that good at secrecy in those days and and whether it would be named the iPhone.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.860]   Scott was sure that it would be named the iPhone.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.420]   Remember those days, Anna, you were you were with us then.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.540]   It's funny that we don't live in that was we were living in a different time.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.660]   Well, again, it was it was still a Steve Jobs era.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.300]   Yeah, I still remember that.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.540]   Gosh, I will I will.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.500]   One of those memories that I just immediately broke the plastic tab off the corner of it.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.900]   Inside joke for people who are above the age of 32 was just being there at the Steve
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.860]   Jobs presentation of the iPhone because and he was a cassette.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.340]   Shut up.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:41.420]   It's the things you're not allowed to touch.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   Yeah, I know that he knows how to.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.820]   Oh, it's 25 years.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.820]   I have to say.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820]   Oh, man.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.060]   But yeah, I mean, that's just just the and every and every and every Apple event.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.220]   There's a certain amount of excitement that is not fake, but it's probably contributed
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.900]   to by the presence of Apple people who are there.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   There's the first one were unequivocally.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.980]   It's like everybody who was trying to be jaded, even the people that I saw who are consistently
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:13.180]   and kind of reliably anti Apple were like, yes, yes, it's a phone and it's an Internet
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.180]   device.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.060]   I was weird too though because it was used to Mackerel and C.S.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.980]   We're back to back and you people flying kind of fly in between both and you never knew
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.860]   which is going to have the bigger announcements.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.420]   And then I think right away to see, yes, was absolutely a clip.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.780]   There's just nothing nothing else announced that you're mattered.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.060]   Yeah, isn't that funny?
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.220]   Yeah, that's all we could talk about.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.340]   We get to Vegas and all you could talk about is Apple.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   Ah, this is really.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.340]   Wasn't even there.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.260]   I didn't have to pay for a single drink or a single dinner because I was like, I was
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.140]   like that elder at the village.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.140]   I'm like, tell us and tell us.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.580]   They tell me that you are the one who held a working iPhone.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   You tell.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.580]   It was an overcast day.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.580]   It was had a lot of time.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.100]   I was tired and here's a rumor that I found fascinating.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.540]   It really came out of left field.
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.900]   A new Apple watch this year.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.900]   Possibly.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.900]   KGI Ming Chi Quo.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   Yeah, Ming Chi Quo.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.500]   Now Ming Chi Quo has a checker history.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.500]   He's an analyst.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.740]   He's better than most other financial analysts.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.660]   He talks a lot about Apple and he talks from the supply chain side, which means he usually
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.100]   has some kind of deeper knowledge.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:26.260]   According to Ming Chi Quo, there will be an Apple watch to later this year, or at least
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:32.260]   announced later this year, with GPS barometer, larger battery, but same thickness.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.980]   Which is an amazing physics.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.580]   Higher capacity, I think.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.180]   Not maybe denser or not.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.180]   Or maybe the electronics take up less room.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.780]   If it has GPS, it would have to have electric capacity battery unless they have a direct
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.780]   sleep chain.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.780]   Same battery life, larger capacity.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:52.620]   They do make watches with GPS that are bigish, but not massive.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.620]   The Garmin.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.100]   It's like Captain America shield on your wrist.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.100]   Okay, that's pretty big.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.060]   There's one Samsung watch that's not much bigger than the iPhone that has GPS built into
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   it.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.260]   It's always an interesting discussion because if you're going to have GPS, I think that
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.100]   either that means that you're going to be reproducing a really fitness focused device
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:16.700]   for people who they are going to want to leave their phones behind.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.380]   And that means that, of course, they're going to be there.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.820]   They're going to be out exercising.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.340]   Or it means that the other reason for leaving your phone behind is that a lot of the reasons
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.700]   why you feel like you need to have your phone in your pocket, that capability is on the
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.700]   watch.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.780]   And for that, for me, that means having some sort of an internet radio on it.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.740]   I don't think that it would be a GSM, but imagine if you just had something that could
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.180]   do at least edge.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.180]   So just little bursts of text.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.780]   You're not streaming music.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.780]   You're not streaming video.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.140]   You're just allowing an app or a server someplace to follow through a message or even just send
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   a basic SMS text message.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.940]   So it's interesting to figure out what reason would you, what kind of device would you build
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.380]   if you've decided you had to have GPS on it?
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.540]   And like I said, there's a really good case for fitness watch.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:09.020]   There's not a great case for a regular watch that has GPS, but it can't do anything to
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.740]   communicate with the outside world unless it's connected to a phone.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.980]   My understanding is that fitness is such a huge market for them.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.900]   And right now a lot of their information says that people are going so far as to jog with
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.100]   an Apple watch and a garment, for example, because all they want is that GPS.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.260]   They just need that accuracy.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.420]   And if they can serve that market, edge is a really good idea, but I think they'd have
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.580]   to go back and actually build their own chipsets by now to do it.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.060]   And Apple is working on motor control on time, but LTE I think is still too hot and too much
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   of a drain.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.020]   That's maybe a next year thing.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.940]   So for now it's sort of just, let's make the joggers really, really happy and then we'll
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.420]   go incrementally from there.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.820]   Also, to be fair, we're still talking about watches that cost about $100 to $500 to $600
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.620]   more than the other popular competitors.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:56.900]   So it's probably a good thing for them to add more palpable value than simply, "Oh,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.700]   look at the styling and look at how nicely the watch bands would gin it out."
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.700]   And it's race to sleep.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.020]   So with the GPS, it's not like you're playing Pokemon Go and you're looking at the screen
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.500]   and using GPS continuously.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.780]   It's your jogging, it's taking a quick reading and empowering down.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.340]   So it probably wouldn't be as big a hit.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.740]   But it's the point you made all along, Andy, which is that watch one was all about figuring
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.940]   out what the hell is this, how are people going to use it, what are the features people
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.300]   want and don't want.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.420]   And Apple presumably has a significant amount of data now and can make watch two be the
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   evolution.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.900]   And clearly they've said or they've seen.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.420]   Friends help know fitness, yes.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.420]   Exactly.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.140]   I mean, just look at how different the watch OS 2 is to watch OS 1, things that were just
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   fundamental.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:41.060]   Again, this button that's just for nothing but your 12 friends, okay, no, we're going
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.540]   to make this for something else.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.980]   And glimpses that are always okay, no, we're going to allow you to simply have a carousel
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.700]   of apps that go from left to right.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.780]   I'm going to love seeing whatever major update they make to the hardware because that's going
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.140]   to be the direct answer to the question.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.980]   What did Apple learn after observing people using their watch for a year and a half to
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.980]   two years?
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.620]   I'm not sure that they're going to.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.900]   The only thing that makes me a little bit skeptical of the idea of a watch to new hardware this
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.740]   year is that I think that the next thing they do with the watch is going to be not just
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.380]   we're adding a barometer or just we're adding a GPS to what we've got now.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.340]   I think that they're going to say if we have to do new tooling to get to get these new
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.740]   batteries, new components aside this thing, we're going to rethink things like the digital
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   crown.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.420]   We're going to rethink things like do we want to place this button on a corner so it's
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.940]   easier to press without having to sort of torque the watch on the band, things like that.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.380]   I think that when they do new hardware, it's just not going to be we're putting new stuff
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.380]   inside the old case.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.060]   I think they're going to rethink and enhance what they made when they built it two years
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.700]   ago.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.300]   So you guys credit this rumor that it does seem possible.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   It's not insane.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.220]   They're not he's not proposing things that have that are would be really hard for Apple
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.540]   to do.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.180]   So he does say do not expect LTE support.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.020]   Yeah, next year, like when they said it's hard.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.020]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.140]   It's battery draining, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.900]   I think he talked about this as well and they maybe put it in another post or something,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.220]   but there's also rumors of a retooled iPhone.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.820]   Sorry, Apple Watch one which if Apple falls there existing strategy, the new one would
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.780]   come out and then the old one would be held on at the lower price level.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.820]   Yeah, make it cheap.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.140]   So that resurfaces the old question we were debating a couple of years ago that if you
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:29.340]   spent $1,000 on a stainless steel watch or God forbid 12 grand on a gold one, are they
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.860]   going to let you swap out the if they do if they do it in such a way that you could.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.380]   It seems as though the dimensions and the hardware buttons are the same.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.220]   Would they do some sort of a trade in rebate?
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:45.180]   Would they allow you to do some sort of a give us your watch will send it back a week
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:51.260]   later with new guts, the new hardware needs and the new software or for $1,000.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.100]   Do you get the nostalgia of saying, you see what you don't know.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.580]   I understand his classical hand tooled software of 2015.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.820]   They don't look like this anymore.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.820]   I could actually see the people that stainless steel watch worrying about that more than
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.820]   some people with a gold watch.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.280]   Like it was one person who bought three of them for his dog because buying four of them
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.500]   would be goish and it's probably they probably already dropped them, you know, in some corners
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.060]   somewhere and haven't looked at them again and they'll just, but did I have one of these
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.060]   before?
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.060]   I don't know, buy me three.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.700]   And that sounds a little bit like that sounds like I don't know, flip it.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.060]   But Apple's market for this was a people who pay $25,000 for a plane ticket from London
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:29.580]   to Dubai by a $20,000 dress and where at once, you know, that that was you just would just
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.580]   not buy an app.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.500]   They want an Apple watch, but they only buy gold watches.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.580]   So this solves that problem for them and it's a totally different sort of market than anything
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.580]   else that goes on.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.980]   But people who spent $1,200 to $1,500 for stainless steel watch, I could see them going, well,
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.620]   wait a minute, you know, $1,000 on my wrist.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.820]   Now this one looks way better.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.060]   There's another $1,000.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.300]   I don't know what to do.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.500]   Well, I for one, I'm ready to spend a lot of money on a new Apple product.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.300]   I just don't know what it'll be.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.300]   Maybe it'll be.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:04.780]   You read the kind of scathing article from the Verge about Apple not.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   It's not angry.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   Yeah, so angry.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:12.020]   Verge used to be thought of as kind of an Apple fan site.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.180]   Maybe they've overcome that.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.420]   This was an opinion piece.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.980]   Well, if it was Niele then.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   Oh, Sam.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   It wasn't.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   Sam Biford.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.620]   Apple should stop selling four-year-old computers.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.300]   This is what we've been talking about of course for some time that some of these computers,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.500]   not all are superannuated.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.220]   The OG MacBook Pro with the spinning optical desk.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.220]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.940]   On the other hand, I've seen rebuttals that say, well, you know, it's not like Intel has
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.900]   made massive improvements in its processors.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:45.200]   What is it about the, for instance, the Mac Pro that you would want upgraded?
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   I mean, you're not going to-
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.400]   It's a concession.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.740]   It's like, it's the same reason they kept the iPad too on the market for so long is that
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.160]   there are people who want to either buy, you know, a truckload of them or there are
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.060]   people who just, they want a MacBook but they want an optical drive.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.540]   And Apple said that's not the future on none of our products and how they're going for.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.780]   But we have the last model we made and we'll keep this on the market for as long as we possibly
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   can.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.600]   And if you really, really, really want that optical disk, you can find it buried somewhere
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.780]   on the store and, you know, enjoy.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.640]   And for everyone else, here is our shiny new MacBook Pro with the OLED.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.440]   And instead of meeting you at the door at the Apple store, we will make you walk all the
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.640]   way back to pick it up and then walk all the way forward while people line and say, "Shame,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.440]   shame, shame, shame."
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   And we will live stream it.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.600]   That to me is more understandable.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.440]   Like the Mac Pro is hard to understand because, you know, even if Intel wasn't quick with the
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.480]   Xeon chips, there's graphics cards that could be updated on that.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.960]   So that to me is just hard to understand why they made such a big deal about it.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.460]   You know, the very famous Phil Schuller, not even any more of my ass and then just let
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.380]   it light follow for three years.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:54.140]   But letting people have that comment is now biting him in the same place, I have to say.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.420]   This is Joel Ruska's response in Extreme Tech.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.980]   And I think Joel actually makes a good point.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.140]   Apple's stagnant product lines.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.580]   He doesn't deny it.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.820]   Mostly reflect the state of the computer industry.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.580]   You know, Apple, yeah, be great if Apple could update it.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.860]   But there's not a lot of compelling new hardware to put in there.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.800]   I think that's the point with the Mac Pro delay.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.920]   Well, I mean, if you want to call it a delay, is that Apple had the choice of putting just
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.040]   the latest generation chips in there and shipping them as is.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.480]   And you know, it's almost like a cliche now.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.400]   Apple's designs have been imitated by almost everybody, sometimes creatively, sometimes
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.600]   exactly.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.840]   Every ultra book pretty much looks like a MacBook Air.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   Most of the higher books look like a MacBook Pro.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.960]   There's just nothing exciting there.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.780]   And Apple does not like doing unexciting things.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:39.160]   So they decided to maybe take a gamble and try something a little bit different.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.360]   You know, maybe that's the OLED strip.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   Maybe it's touch ID.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.720]   But that proved to be harder to bring to market than maybe the original timeline suggested.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.060]   So instead of a skylake bump, we're now, you know, three months past WWE DC hoping that
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.540]   it arrives in September.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.000]   But otherwise it would have been just that, an incremental update that would have helped
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.200]   a small percentage of people who really would have found a difference in either the battery
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.120]   savings or the clock speed.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.800]   And now you have a chance and maybe it'll succeed.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   Maybe it won't.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.360]   But now you have a chance, you know, to put something new on the market.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.660]   And I think that's what Apple strives to do.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.260]   Had they of course done that, you know, just shipped out a new shiny with slight upgrade
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.840]   I might have and others might have said, oh, they're just trying to get you to buy new
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.500]   stuff without much of an improvement.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.680]   It's just a yeah, it's all about money.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   It's all about.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.220]   And there is, I mean, I think people who complain, including myself, we just want a new computer
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.780]   every few years is not that you need one.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.660]   Apple wants to sell millions is upset that we are that there aren't new MacBook Pro's
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.660]   there.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:32.660]   Can you everyone in Apple retail?
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:33.660]   Everyone in Apple.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.660]   Everyone in Apple.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.660]   Yeah, they would love it.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.660]   Wouldn't they?
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.660]   They are like, and they have to.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.660]   They have to smile and grit their teeth.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.660]   There is nothing else they can do.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.140]   It's meant to be on market.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.300]   What's happening with it?
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.940]   What everyone is saying about it?
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.700]   And they know like, this is when we can bring it to market and they're just smiling and
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.740]   they're missing, you know, they're missing education sales right now.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.780]   I'm sure they're not happy about that one bit.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.220]   But the other side of the coin is a lot of people, they don't have the luxury of waiting
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   a year.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.100]   Sometimes like their MacBook is just dead.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.580]   Again, they dropped off cliff.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.580]   It's dead.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:11.340]   Or they need to buy 18 new Mac minis or iMacs because that's what they have to build out
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.860]   a new office.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.340]   And if they look, if they're saying, geez, if we even if they had the, they would love
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:21.820]   to have the benefit of two years of incremental updates because they would have something that's
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.260]   even even a little bit more modern as opposed to we're going to buy it.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.780]   And then four months from now, that's when Apple feels as though they've come down for
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.740]   the mountain and contain the stone tablets of we now have the new CPU and we now have
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.780]   this new interface thing and we now have this new multi touch screen thing that we were
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.180]   saving for when we thought the time was right, even though we had this pretty much ready
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.860]   to go a year ago or two years ago, only just in part in pieces and parcels.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.140]   And it's like, okay, great.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:51.340]   But I just spent 12 grand on computers that are still about two or three years old.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:56.140]   And if you just simply stopped focusing on making the best of waiting until you could
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.820]   make this the best version it could possibly be.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.860]   And instead gave a little bit more time thinking about what about the person who's buying a
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.900]   new MacBook right now?
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.020]   Can we make the best thing for that person right now?
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:13.340]   That's that person's going to feel a little minest.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.140]   But let's take a break.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:28.340]   Talk more and Iannaco Chicago Sun times Renee Richie, the I'm more family of products.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.700]   The I'm more conglomerate.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.700]   The kiritsu.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.700]   The haliburna.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.700]   The haliburna.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   The haliburna.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   The haliburna.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.700]   The tech journalism.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.540]   They just keep on going.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.220]   You know what doesn't keep on going?
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.780]   Oftentimes your Wi-Fi.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.540]   How many times have why are they showing Renee?
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.180]   Why are you showing Renee?
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.380]   Look at this man.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.820]   I'm a Wi-Fi dad's only watch this man.
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.780]   Does he look happy about his Wi-Fi?
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.340]   No, he's suffering.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.500]   He's suffering because he's not using Iro.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.180]   I have to say Iro won me over.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.380]   Iro got a lot of attention when they first came out.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:14.980]   The idea being you can do a better job with a Wi-Fi router, but I had to be convinced
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.420]   and I was.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.820]   And let me put it this way.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.460]   I don't have any choice because Lisa won't let me take the Iro out now.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:29.300]   She says she's been complaining for so long about our Wi-Fi dropping packets, buffering,
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.940]   just not working.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.700]   And I said, well, let's try this Iro thing.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.260]   And now, you know, that's it.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.260]   She's done.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.260]   She's found it.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.340]   I keep saying is a Wi-Fi okay?
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.340]   She says, what do you mean?
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340]   Of course it's great.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.340]   It's Iro.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.340]   E-E-R-O.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.340]   Look, we know that the single router model isn't working in a lot of homes because of
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.340]   several things.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   And that's the question.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:59.260]   A lot of people have many, many Wi-Fi access spots in their vicinity, but it's also because
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.580]   our houses are a little bit more spread out.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:06.260]   We got metal in the walls and there's an upstairs or downstairs.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:11.220]   Iro is the first home Wi-Fi system that blankets your entire house and fast, reliable Wi-Fi.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.220]   No more buffering, no more dead zones.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.220]   Wi-Fi that works.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.700]   It's essentially an enterprise Wi-Fi system, but it's easy to use.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.180]   This is really what they've done that's so brilliant.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.980]   You set it up using your iPhone or you can use an Android phone if you want.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.460]   It walks you through the process.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.180]   The Iro lets you manage your network from the phone, including port forwarding, port
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.340]   reservations, all the things that you'd want to do.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.980]   It's of course, state of the art, WPA2 encryption.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.020]   Really good customer support.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.420]   And I've called them just to test it out and it's fabulous.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.420]   And it looks good.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.900]   It's not one of those things with big, it's not like a spider.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.220]   It looks like just a little lozenge.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.500]   Now you can buy one at a time, but I bought the 3-pack.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.140]   And now what's nice is I can add additional.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.980]   As you grow, you can add additional.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.980]   There is a 30-day money-back guarantee.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.500]   It could not be easier to set up.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.380]   A friend of mine just bought an Iro on my recommendation because I've been talking about
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.260]   it for some time as you probably know.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.780]   But he hasn't set it up yet.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.420]   And he says, "It's going to be easy."
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.420]   I said, "Yes, it's going to be easy."
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.980]   It's very easy.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.780]   E-E-R-O.com.

[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.020]   It's really fast.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.220]   It's really easy.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.660]   It really works.

[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.100]   Iroco.com.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.180]   Don't forget the Mac break off or code for free overnight shipping.

[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.460]   Stat.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.380]   You can't pry that Iro out of my cold, dead fingers.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.140]   It's actually, it's done some things that I cannot figure out how to do.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.940]   I couldn't figure out how to do my ASUS.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.100]   Port reservations is great.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.980]   So you say this because I want a server on it, right?
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:10.700]   And then it was, and then I had a weird Comcast configuration.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.580]   I didn't know how weird it was until the Iro fixed it.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.140]   And it was like, "Oh, wow, this is great."
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.460]   So it's pretty sophisticated.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.900]   I replaced airport extremes with Iro some is asking the chat room much, much better.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.580]   Yeah, talk about un-updated products.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.580]   You know?
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.220]   Honestly, it seems like when the cheapest things you can do to change and improve your
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.620]   entire life inside the house is to go through your house, go through your entire network,
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:42.380]   any box that has a power supply that is more than five years old, just don't even think
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.780]   about it by a new one of those.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:49.140]   I just replaced my cable modem and suddenly all these, all these, all the software and
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.660]   services that I could not get to work are suddenly plug and play again.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.500]   And it's like, my God, it's like, it's like I did not realize how dirty my glasses were
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.900]   until someone handed me a lens wipe and suddenly, "Oh, that's what I've been missing."
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.980]   It really is kind of like, "Oh, the future is here."
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.660]   Yeah, they came and replaced my modem too.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.500]   And it's not a faster modem, but it's got a higher level of aggregation.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.340]   So it's hard to explain the difference.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.060]   It's still fast, but it's worked so much better.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.060]   Mine's even faster, actually.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.900]   It really made a big difference.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.220]   Mostly like on those areas where in the past, the speed was going down because the Wi-Fi
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.860]   wasn't strong, the signal wasn't strong.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.020]   It's fine bars everywhere.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.740]   In fact, it's a little bit of a problem because I'm playing Pokemon Go in the house on Wi-Fi
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:32.020]   and I'm walking up the street and the handoff doesn't occur until I'm down to like a block
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   away.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.300]   So it's like, you know, I want to go to LTE now.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   And it looks like something Apple would have designed, actually.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.300]   It's quite beautiful.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.220]   I really hope that if Apple surprises us with something that no one has rumored, I hope
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.460]   that that device would be a new networking device because you talk about making life
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.380]   better for people in a material intangible way.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:59.740]   You just solve networking problems with someone's house and boom, you just, I will give you
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.060]   $15,000 for the next watch.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.820]   I'm so grateful for the fact that Wi-Fi works everywhere.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.380]   It's super fast and it's super secure.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.260]   And every time I plug something new in, it just works.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.140]   Well, it's plumbing now, isn't it?
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.140]   You just expect it.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.140]   You need it.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.140]   You expect it.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.660]   It was staged all your product updates, keeping cash locally, keeping, you know, your iCloud
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:17.660]   cash locally.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.180]   And there's so many interesting things they could do with, they finally put out that
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.180]   update it.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.900]   How many people come home from like a week in a really, really good hotel?
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.980]   And the first thing they do is arrange to have a new shower head installed.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.980]   I love that really shower.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.980]   I love that.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.780]   I have no idea that since 1978 they've done so much.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.620]   Wonderful things in shower heads.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.620]   Shower heads.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.620]   Is there anything they can do?
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.780]   I thought the shower massage was a great innovation when I was eight years old.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.780]   I'm going to take a shower head.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   It's funny.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.780]   Take it off your clothes.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.660]   It's so funny that you say that because actually I have done that.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.460]   It's so funny that you say it.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.500]   The toilet seat is heated.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.380]   What, and do you think there'll be any unexpected announcements from Apple?
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:01.180]   By the way, normally in the past we've had a September iPhone and it's October iPad
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180]   announcement.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.780]   I'm figuring that that's not going to happen anymore.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.780]   Didn't last year.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.780]   It didn't last year.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.780]   It was just so much.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.780]   It's a lot of work for them to coordinate those things even when they do it at Town Hall.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.980]   And if they don't need to, if there's not some big product that they have to show off,
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:18.020]   and this year it's hard because traditionally they would have done, traditionally, for the
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:23.980]   last few years they would have done iPhone and iPod touch when that was still a thing
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:28.100]   right away in September and then Mac and iPad in October.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.820]   Last year they did Apple TV and iPhone and iPad Pro and the new Apple Watch bands all
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:38.340]   in September and then the iMac update with the high-color resolution was just a press
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.340]   release.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.700]   So it depends on how they want to do that.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:46.180]   If they could stage another massive event, maybe do it at the Civic Center again and have
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:51.820]   iPhone and if they bump the iPads to A10 processors too and the iPads and maybe the Apple Watch
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.420]   and the MacBook Pros with all those.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   It's a big event.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.340]   I think they would, I don't think if this, you know, and Ben Lumjoy is once again published
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.740]   the rumor in 9-5 Mac that the new MacBooks will feature fingerprint reader, a touch ID
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.300]   power button and this OLED touch panel at the top instead of function keys.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.660]   If they, that's a significant enough thing that you don't just want to, I just unplug
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   something.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.540]   What did I just unplug there?
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.540]   Is it working again?
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.540]   I kicked something.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.460]   You don't want that an oppressor.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.780]   You don't, yeah, you don't want that an oppressor release.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.260]   You want to say something about it.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.660]   You want, Phil Schiller wants to say innovation, my, you know what, my keyster.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.860]   It's also storytelling like we're talking about at the top of the show.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.420]   If they do, if and when Apple deletes the headphone jack, there's going to be a story
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.620]   behind it of how they arrived at this decision and the possibilities that are possible now
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.720]   they've done this.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.740]   And if they do something as wonderful as cool as it is, the idea of having an OLED function
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:52.300]   key strip, that is such an instinctively cool idea that they're going to want to show that
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.100]   off and they're going to want to say that no, it's not.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.620]   It's not just to be able to change the color of these keys and to put an Internet Explorer
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.860]   icon up there when an Internet Explorer closes.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.660]   Here is how it's going to change and improve your day to day life with this thing.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.220]   I'm out.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.220]   Oh, God, it hurt.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.220]   I'm under the table.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.220]   Try.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   Go down.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.220]   Go down.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.220]   I just hit it.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.220]   I just hit you, Renee.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   No, I got it.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.220]   It's all okay.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.220]   Be okay.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.220]   Be true.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.220]   It reminds me.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.420]   Remember the art, Lebadev OLED keyboard with the changing key caps?
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.900]   What how many years ago was that a decade ago?
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.660]   We're finally actually making something like that, right?
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.660]   Yeah, mainstreaming.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.660]   Yeah, it makes a real sense.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.300]   I think there have been I think there have been gaming keyboards and I know I've seen
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:47.260]   OLED strips on one of those things that DJs and musicians use where they tap on the IMP
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.260]   MPV.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.260]   Right.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.660]   Motion controllers.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:58.500]   So it's not even really tough technology, but it would be really cool to have it.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.220]   Yeah, it's because it goes beyond just simply having 12 key caps.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.220]   MPV.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.220]   Things when you press them.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.260]   It goes into things like having doing Photoshop and being able to keep your color palette right
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.620]   there, like when you need this color, you tap on it.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:17.340]   Or when you're making an adjustment, suddenly this becomes a thousand step slider that runs
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.180]   the 12 inches wide as opposed to carefully trying to scroll up too much.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.500]   No, no, a little bit too.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:29.100]   So that's if not only exists, but also Apple allows developers full access to it and to
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.220]   make it do whatever they wanted to do, that would be pretty astounding.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.540]   That would make me wish that I spilled Dr. Pepper on my laptop this year.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.540]   I know.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.740]   Well, here's the other thing I'm really could be very excited about.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.100]   And this is again from same article in nine to five Mac.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:49.980]   This is based on pictures of the chassis for USB C ports.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.540]   No mag safe adapter anymore.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.740]   USB C would be used for power with embedded support for the new Thunderbolt three standard.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.980]   That would make me really interested in this.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.740]   Yeah, I'd have to buy one then.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.180]   Yeah, it'd be not for for it.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:10.820]   I still stand by the idea that a MacBook Pro should require as few Donald's as possible,
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:16.300]   but that could be such a butt kicker for the for the MacBook nothing or the MacBook Air.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:21.180]   The idea of having because you can transport everything across USB C. It's a wonderful cable
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.180]   standard.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.700]   It would bring Apple back into the fold of we are using the exact same sort of connectors
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.940]   that everybody else is using.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.020]   So you're not going to force you to carry another connector with you.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.420]   It would kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill the mag safe to connect it, which
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:40.460]   is something I would love to do because it just keeps popping up for absolutely no reason.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.700]   So I put it on your lap.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.060]   It's great.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   It's great.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.340]   So long as you keep the MacBook on your desk and you also have gaffer tape taping the
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.180]   cord down and.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.740]   No, I think that's great too.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:59.260]   I mean, I'm a little bit sad that DisplayPort whatever 1.4 didn't make it into Thunderbolt
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.100]   three standard, which is the big beefy one that we're all hoping for.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.940]   It's not even making it into Canon Lake, which is the next tick tock after the current after
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.140]   Skylake already.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.580]   So a little bit sad about the display future, but I think that's a phenomenal port.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.980]   It'll work with all the accessories they've already made for the MacBook and it's just
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.820]   I'm super looking for it to say, I want to buy it now.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:20.820]   Can I buy it now, Apple?
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.180]   Sorry, I'm losing it here.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.180]   I just want that MacBook.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:31.340]   Well, according to rumors and nine to five Mac, we'll be getting one this year.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.420]   And I if they're going to do it, they're going to do it at the same time and they
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.740]   announce the iPhone say have to, right?
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.740]   Unless you're going to do an October and November event.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.700]   Oh, my understanding is it was very similar to Apple TV last year is that originally targeted
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.060]   at WWDC couldn't make it in by then.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.700]   So it's retargeted in September because that's the next big event.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.060]   So this may be a super event to coming up in fire, everything.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.940]   Yeah, less than a month.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:59.180]   What do you think that the idea of having a huge keynote ready facility on campus 24/7
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.180]   is going to do to Apple's release schedule?
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.180]   That's right.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.500]   Are they they're going to now think that like if they had something that was that they were
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:11.460]   targeting for WWDC that if they decide they need an extra five weeks, they will do the
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.940]   event on the second week of August.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.500]   Or are they still going to say, okay, well, we don't feel like we want to put have an
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.700]   event anytime we want to throw an event.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:25.820]   We still think we want to keep to a predictable window so that people know people can at least
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.180]   we can't talk about what we're going to be doing, but people can at least anticipate
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.780]   that we might have something interesting to talk about or interesting hardware they might
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:36.300]   want to budget for in September of any given year.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.700]   Yeah, that would be super handy.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.180]   I think the events team is still like all Apple teams are small and they work incredibly
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.420]   hard and I don't know how easy it is for them to do multiple events.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.620]   But if they have the home base advantage, maybe that is something that they can maybe
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.820]   they can't do that many more.
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.940]   Maybe they could do one or two more a year to sort of fit their schedule.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.300]   Yeah, or just, you know, invite people in, have a coffee.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.740]   Say, hey, by the way, slides are here.
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.340]   Got some September event is all of September come anytime you want.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.340]   They're there.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.900]   I bet you they're craving this new campus.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.140]   They're crazy like that.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.380]   Yeah, they know I could see them doing stuff like that.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.980]   You yourself know that you're sitting in the results of what happens when you no longer
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:20.260]   have to simply work in a place that you have adapted to suit.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.500]   You've adapted yourself like what purpose bill is awesome.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.420]   I'm going to put I'm going to put a bathroom right outside the studio.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.420]   Right.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.820]   We can we can do things during commercial breaks instead of just right this for 20 minutes
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.660]   because 30 second had me iron man's suit is right outside the door.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.660]   I walk in it puts it on a fly out.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:42.620]   Actually, I'm a little nervous because in the new studio is like like many a radio station
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:47.060]   I've worked in the bathroom is on the other side of a self locking door.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.340]   It's near.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.500]   I can I can run out, but the door will lock behind me and I care.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.340]   I'm just writing the day that I'm going.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.820]   I mean, the records running out.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.580]   The answer that is you have like a handle behind glass with a hammer on his chain next
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.140]   to a behind that is an ethernet port a camera and a microphone.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.620]   I'm out here in the hall finishing Mac break weekly.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:18.100]   What are we going to get that John and special mobile studio see we're in the mobile mobile
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:23.300]   mobile with me at all times live from the head.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.700]   Whatever our plans for that, John, what do you think?
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.820]   We can't hang a key out there because that's that that's a public entrance.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:32.220]   People could walk in a score.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.340]   We're going to score me and have a have a doorminder.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.260]   It's it's that or a bed pan.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:44.460]   I think I just clip I just clip the the key fob to my shirt like a like a four year old
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:49.860]   like I have I have have keys sewn into my clothing and you have an NFC lock that your
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.300]   phone can just it is NFC.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.500]   Oh, but it doesn't work.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.820]   Does it work with the phone now that would be a good one.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.580]   No, it's it's the it's a fob system.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.460]   No, why doesn't work with the phone?
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.180]   We should have got something to call the motor is helper.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.580]   They'll never let me do this.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:10.460]   That's why when you say purpose built it's a dream true Andy, but there are limits.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.100]   I think Lisa just said no.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.460]   No, no phone for you.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.300]   No for you.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.300]   Planet of the apps.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:27.060]   Now know the the I really yeah.
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.660]   Oh, Malek was marvelous on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:38.580]   He said Apple needs to focus on doing the job better, not on pathetic reality shows.
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.980]   However, you know, I have other problems with planet of the apps.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.660]   I think it's going to unfortunately create a whole generation of kids who think, you
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.900]   know, just like I could, you know, like survivor.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:49.900]   Oh, it's easy.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.900]   You just make it happen.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:57.620]   You get will I am one of the judges when is Paltrow and Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.620]   These are the judges.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.580]   Is it will I am still making his own blackberry in the rim labs?
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.580]   I'm confused.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.580]   Oh, yeah, what happened?
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.580]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.820]   So making his own car based on the GMC the the Dorian.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.460]   It's I don't know.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.980]   I'm confident that this is new.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.180]   Apps are going to be every fit as successful as the box office results of every project
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.180]   runway movie.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.740]   Yeah, I think that every band that was on MTV is making the band is going to be as
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:26.100]   it's project green light project runway.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.100]   Really?
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.900]   Project runway did a couple of designers have come out of project runway.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.060]   They've been quite successful.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.060]   All right.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.620]   This is a different team.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.060]   So it's not it's not like they took people off the MacBook project to put them on this.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.820]   So like it is a different team, but I understand it still distracts, right?
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.500]   So the goal for this is once you go along with Apple, it's the same thing with Netflix
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.660]   and them doing original programming.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:50.300]   And why Amazon is doing original programming is once you have a subscription service, it's
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.500]   a very different model than just a purchase surface.
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.460]   You have to provide content that people are going to not just want to buy, but want to
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.460]   subscribe to your service.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.460]   It's exclusive.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.460]   And then not unsubscribe.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.460]   So it's like Game of Thrones.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.940]   Are we going to just like go of HBO after it's ended?
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:07.060]   Are we going to stay on because all this other cool thing and you want to drive subscriptions
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.180]   and Apple is willing to do that with both audio and video and like audio they did the
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.180]   Taylor Swift deal.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.420]   They've done a few others.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.500]   They've been Tim Cook has been helping out with videos apparently.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.100]   But with this, they have a chance to make original programming.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:23.900]   Whether it's Dr. Dre's music show or it's Planet of the Apps or it's carpool karaoke.
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:27.700]   It's just ways to get people to see this and go, Oh, word, I want to see more of this.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.300]   I'm going to subscribe to Apple music.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.340]   And then it just drives the adoption of that service.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.340]   It's a very, very nice.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.340]   I understand.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:38.220]   And if if Apple's cloud services were working perfectly and they were creating new products
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.660]   and innovating, I would be less critical.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:46.180]   But it seems like this is where Apple's innovating and that's not exciting.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.940]   No, they have they've got a lot of interests now.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   And I don't mean financial issues.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.340]   I mean that like a creator can just like the Beatles.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.300]   It took them a while to go from, Hey, we're for lads who are doing like jangly love songs
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.140]   to revolver and then to and then do everything they're doing after that.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.380]   They're expanding their level of interest.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:06.060]   And there isn't it's not like there's a fixed number amount of interest and a fixed amount
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.100]   of attention that Apple can pay.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.820]   They can have they got so many so many people that got such a big campus that they can have
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.740]   a group working on this sort of stuff.
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.940]   So I don't think this kind of just I don't think it's going to distract them from whatever
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.020]   they feel their mission is.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:27.020]   I see this more as a really low risk way to experiment with original content without
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:31.300]   making a big deep end of the pool splash into it.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.340]   I think that Renee makes a good point.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:37.980]   I think that Apple would love to have be as an important driver of original content as
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.540]   Netflix is and Netflix is as powerful as any independent studio has been in the past
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.700]   two years the film industry.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.540]   They I don't think they're at a point yet where they can hope to do that.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.780]   But what they can do is they can produce a couple of things that are very natural fits
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   for Apple that can be either a huge success or just be something they did.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.380]   They said that we're glad we made it and we're not going to have and then they never make
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:01.740]   another one again.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:05.220]   Just like remember there's a time where Apple was sort of hit or miss between whether they're
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.580]   going to be live streaming keynote events and things like that.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.940]   You never knew if they were going to do it and maybe they wouldn't even announce it until
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.260]   a couple days before.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.820]   A lot of those were trial balloons.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.420]   We don't know if we have the server capacity.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:20.700]   We're going to use this as an experiment to see can we handle how can we serve a huge
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:25.140]   amount of data to random people on a live event in a way that's consistent and they
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:29.220]   could do that without announcing we're here today to announce we're going to be a live
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.220]   streaming company.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.260]   We have a live streaming product that's perfect and will revolutionize the industry.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.940]   It's not a problem if two days before you never announced that you're going to be live streaming
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.700]   this event you decide that you can't live stream the event.
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:47.420]   Similarly with this thing if they have anything that results in any viewership whatsoever
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:52.180]   is a success with these original content and then they come to the problem of who is going
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:58.180]   to be our Jimmy Iovine of attracting filmmakers and TV producers to produce original content
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:03.300]   for Apple TV because that's the biggest problem of them all.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:08.140]   The dome said buy Netflix.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.380]   So yeah that's interesting because Apple music is on Android and Netflix is on everything
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.380]   I think my toaster has Netflix now.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:16.340]   It's just a matter of me writing Netflix.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.540]   I don't know if there's for sale but Apple certainly has the cash to do it.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:24.340]   Like Alex says by Disney or just get into the programming.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:31.780]   They also have an exclusive on carpool karaoke but it won't be James Corden doing it.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:36.060]   So I don't know if you really can carry the strength.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:39.300]   I heard that it wasn't originally him it was a different DJ started with Taylor Swift
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.940]   and he sort of adopted the segment.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.780]   So maybe as I pointed out on Sunday this is a long tradition.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.980]   I mean it goes back not just to Jerry Seinfeld the comedians and cars getting coffee but
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:54.860]   before that Robert Llewellyn of Red Dwarf who did carpool which is wonderful.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.860]   Was it carpool?
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.420]   Yeah I was I was I was a guest.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.420]   You were too.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:01.420]   It was great.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:06.820]   Bobby's not doing it anymore but that was I think the earliest of these and there is
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.660]   something magical about getting people together in a car.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.660]   You let your hair down.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.660]   I mean if you get.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.580]   There's a love show in your host profile.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.820]   But I do also think that James Corden is what makes carpool karaoke good.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.820]   So well we'll see.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.020]   You have to find someone just as fun.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.580]   I hope Michelle has been a great show.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.580]   She could take over.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.420]   Michelle's got some time.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.060]   Yeah we'll see.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.660]   I feel like apple.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.460]   Just fix eye too.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.460]   I think we'll see.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:42.220]   I mean this is something I'm very familiar with this sort of reaction because I it's something
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:46.660]   that I've been navigating myself and I think that a lot of it isn't apples fault.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:51.140]   It's that a lot of us old timers have this picture of apple and who they are and what
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:55.860]   they're supposed to be and I think that in my in I can only speak for myself in my defense.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.100]   I think that a lot of that sort of criticism is correct or at least it's very rational.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:07.340]   But nonetheless it some of this sort of criticism doesn't allow apple to become something that
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.740]   we I personally don't want it to be.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.900]   Even though it's something that they're they can do really well even though there is a percentage
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:17.060]   of the people that would be much better served by this new version of apple than by whatever
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.100]   old version of apple that I'm imagining.
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:24.980]   And finally whatever apple was 10 years ago it's only what I imagine that it was it's not
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.300]   what it actually was because I've never worked for apple.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:31.740]   I've never you know only someone who's worked at the vice president level or above can correctly
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:36.020]   talk about here is what the purpose of apple is and here is what what the focus is certainly
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:45.620]   is it's there's to you know modify or fix this is a long think piece with Tim Cook from
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.780]   Fast Company was actually because they talk about right at the beginning Eddie Q being
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:55.140]   disappointed about the Warriors loss in the NBA playoff so the interview goes back a few
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:57.380]   months.
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:02.740]   I you know I think there's some I think boy this is heresy to say especially an apple
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.900]   podcast.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.140]   I think the jury still out on whether Tim Cook has the vision to take apple into the
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:18.220]   next thing is no question he's a very good steward of the status quo.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:23.220]   I don't I don't see that vision I don't and I hate to see Eddie Q and Phil Schiller decide
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.780]   what apple is going to be.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:31.700]   I would never make that accusation about Tim only because sorry Mr. Cook only because
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.220]   it's such an that's such an abstract sort of thing that someone with vision.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.700]   Oh you have to judge a company by what they're doing.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:45.460]   Yeah but it's the company that they that that Tim Cook has in 2016 is not the same company
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:50.020]   that Steve Jobs said in 2007 I agree and I'm just saying I judging based on what the company
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:54.180]   in 2016 is I don't know if Tim's really doing a good job.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:00.020]   Again again I can't I can't I can't say plus or plus or minus I think that is again such
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:07.620]   an abstract concept and also you know you've evil evil can evil jumping buses at age 27
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.380]   is exciting and awesome right evil can evil of age 68 he shouldn't be jumping buses he
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.020]   should be he should be teaching the next generation he should be designing motorcycles
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.860]   that will jump buses and he should be designing safety equipment.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.500]   Apple might not Apple might be the company that's better at running the infrastructure
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:28.700]   and creating the tools that young people use to create the next greatest thing rather than
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.500]   trying to create the next greatest thing now that they have all the now they have the
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.580]   burden of they have to continue to be the support itself at their current scale.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.820]   Remember that the most of the engineering of a bridge is into making sure the weight of
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:47.020]   the bridge does not cause the bridge itself to collapse and when a company gets to be
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:51.900]   a certain size that in itself becomes a great amount of the work and the money and the time
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.660]   and the effort that goes into running the company.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:59.260]   Yeah and I'll be the first to say A who might I say B just because they're not doing what
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.740]   I want them to do doesn't mean they're doing the wrong thing.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:08.700]   C the stock market loves them D they're making a ton of money so by every reasonable metric
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.700]   they're doing fine.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:15.860]   I just I when I see Apple saying we're going to do you know TV shows and we can't fix iTunes
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:21.180]   and iClouds fall on a part and I just and I mean it's it's all like one of the hardest
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.300]   things here is competing with a ghost because no matter what Tim Cook does he'll never be
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:28.460]   Steve Jobs and I don't want to do jobs would be like today like if Steve Jobs had to run
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.180]   a modern Apple we may not be temperamentally or you know you might have a different skill
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.180]   set and the trick to Apple has always been a dynamic like as much as Steve Jobs was in
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:41.620]   front he the old the old saying was you know only Steve Jobs could think of an iPad but
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:46.300]   only Tim Cook could have made a ship under and they just need like Tim Cook can be that
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.700]   position he can be that person they just need to figure out what that product person is
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.500]   to compliment him the same way he complimented Steve Jobs and maybe it's Johnny Ivan maybe
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.180]   it's it's three or four people to make that dynamic and once that that clicks is and maybe
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.180]   it's click now and it's just there's a lot of we're in a lot of takes a while and it's
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.660]   hard to see yeah but I think that as long as you have those sort of pillars you can
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.940]   build a phenomenal foundation on them.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.140]   Yeah I'm just raising the issue I agree it sounds it's stupid and I probably shouldn't say
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:19.580]   it but but I'm starting to get this niggling feeling that I don't I just not crazy about
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.460]   and you're right and nostalgic about the way Apple uses to be and then but they're also
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.780]   facing like Steve Jobs at his height like that iPhone press conference that was something
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.980]   new and amazing with something we really hadn't seen before and we filled that gap all that
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:37.260]   slack has been taken up now and it's really unclear there will not be another iPhone
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.660]   style product it's just the laws like the opportunities of things have to come together
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:45.020]   to make that happen to make a business more profitable than Exxon that you hold in your
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:49.260]   hands just stupefying so Tim Cook is living in a world where I he came into this job with
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.580]   iPhone and iPad being done and a sort of his job alright to like Steve Jobs got the card
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.780]   at 200 and we're saying okay Steve get it sorry Tim get it to 300 right and he's like
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.500]   what's a car right you know so he's got to invent a plane and that that takes a long
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:08.980]   time yep let's take a break we'll take the August update on the Apple campus is in we're
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:17.060]   getting close it's almost done and we have lots more to talk about including a dolphin
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.340]   stole well it did what many of us want to do took the iPad out of the hand of a lady
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:30.100]   who wasn't watching the show dolphins are smart now I hope you're watching the show
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.300]   probably what the lady was doing on her iPad was reading a magazine on texture that's what
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.380]   I have been doing if you're bored if you're on an airplane if you're at the supermarket
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:44.220]   what a pro that is decades of professional broadcast ladies and gentlemen I do these

[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.820]   which I probably wouldn't want to read every every week but sometimes there's really good
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:30.860]   stuff in there or recipes from you know Bona petit or or maybe you want to know what the

[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:03.060]   a lot of piles milk you're going to need for that donut oh man you know it's one mile in
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:09.500]   circumference 1500 meters across a garden and a pond the reason they all the sand it's going
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:16.420]   to be inside will be a garden and a pond a hundred thousand square foot as they have
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:22.820]   at least one rally cross day it's not over yet respect I can't respect them look at baseball
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:28.620]   and tennis courts you know of course the challenge for any company in Silicon Valley is to attract
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:33.460]   the best talent right out of college and this is this is how you do it you have an amazing
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.820]   campus with all these a hundred thousand square foot fitness center right there so people stay
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:45.620]   and work late and and they want to work there yeah not only that but that's the security kiosk
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:53.700]   yeah yeah so these are machine goods are they the first no actually for the first time I'm
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:58.500]   thinking there must if they're building everything that they could possibly hope and dream of
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:04.940]   are there like not cells but like secure or a walkable rooms with cameras on them where they
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:10.460]   can take people who are naughty at my business they schedule a meeting someplace where they
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:16.780]   know that they're at least communicating that if you wanted to fight us we would I don't
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:22.420]   think there's apple jail I really don't I hope not like Disney is underground yeah don't
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:26.140]   you think though they're gonna have to build a pretty big wall around this thing because
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:33.540]   I want to immigrate this is this is the role of architecture when a company reaches a certain
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:38.620]   level it's not just we need to house a certain number of people and we need a certain facility
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:43.420]   it's also we want to build a permanent structure on the planet that when people go buy it it
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:48.780]   distinctly communicates who we are right and ideally in a hundred years we'll still be here
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:54.700]   and this will still be an expression of if we had a flag if we had our own money we would
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.420]   have this on our money and on our flag the only thing that makes me sad is that in fact I will
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:07.100]   never be allowed through those gates ever ever don't forget what do I have to be the do I have to be
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.820]   the Dean Martin that Jerry Lewis no I don't think that's the first time I guess Jerry Lewis
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:19.020]   and Dean Martin back together I'm so tired of you saying call to him no I that's fine it's
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.060]   pretty cool it's pretty cool that's pretty amazing yeah cool because of iTunes there meanwhile we're
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:33.020]   rolling glue on the floor of our tiny little studio would fit in that parking lot there you go
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.820]   the new after campus oh they're putting in the carpet now look at that
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:47.500]   here's the round theater the round theater show this this is the this is the this is where
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:53.580]   there this is going to be the new place where they're going to show it does look like Minecraft
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:57.580]   doesn't it oh then if the press are bad they're going to flood it with water yeah now now that I
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:05.260]   look at it I so want that entire structure to be retractable yeah flatten out to the bottom and
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:10.540]   become like a baseball the reason it looks like Minecraft those those are foam blocks that they
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.100]   put on top of the underground structures for insulation and they put they'll put dirt on top of that
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:21.020]   so how they pack more batteries into the face by staggering that terrace the terrace the layout
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.100]   I love this look at all the solar cells these will be on top of the parking structure and the
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:31.180]   and the building itself really let's compare notes have you two decided I've got here are the 11
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:37.420]   people I know at Apple that can give me the biggest tour of this place when it's done and the order
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:42.220]   in which I will start hinting that I want to spend two days just being a given given a tour of this
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:48.940]   place mmm oh yeah it really looks incredible we promised Apple to give you good coverage forever
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:55.580]   if you just let us bring our cameras in can we have a review unit I mean please exactly I want to
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:02.300]   review you know that the Apple campus too yes I do yes look at that wow these drone shots are
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:08.860]   are incredible and the drone is like right next to the building right next to the crane you got at
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.860]   this point thank you Matthew Roberts for making this at this point you got to figure Apple is and by
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:22.220]   the way what have I done to deserve this YouTube every time I watch a YouTube video they suggest
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:29.500]   bikini clad I just watched the Apple campus so the GoPro that makes sense space in 4k more
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:34.460]   Apple campus videos sure by all means keep the picture up
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:41.900]   I don't I don't watch those videos I don't know why they keep profing them to me I know it's
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.460]   it's it's it's it's probably SEO they probably keyword stuffed it with Apple campus Apple campus
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:50.620]   oh he must want to see bikinis yeah yeah no the bikini videos like let's get all those Apple
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:55.660]   campus video views I'm just gonna Apple campus to Apple donut Apple spaceship well and best plus
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:02.140]   it's YouTube so you know that that is one frame in a four-hour video that has nothing else of interest
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:09.180]   but I'm starting to wonder about the the drone footage though I have to I recently have I have to
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:14.540]   get a a FAA drone operators license for a project that I'm going to be doing in the next couple months
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.300]   and so I had to start looking at what the rules are and at least in Massachusetts
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:23.820]   you're prohibited against flying it over private property unless you have permission of the property
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:27.020]   owners I think that's nationwide I think that's an FAA rule yeah that's that's that's that's
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:32.140]   FAY so I don't I'm not I'm not suggesting anything I'm no nor am I doing the national
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.980]   political candidate thing of saying I don't know what's going on as a way of suggesting that I
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:41.420]   know what's going on and that this is what's going on I'm curious as to how often you could
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:46.860]   I'm curious if there's if there if they're the wink wink none if the unofficial policy inside of
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:52.540]   Apple is that actually we love we've seen these videos they're really really cool we are going
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:57.500]   to turn a blind eye I think we're not we're not we're not the end I can use one of those cranes
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.500]   disc I can use one of those cranes to try to swat it away even though we have the software that
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:06.140]   could have to do that and I'd like to say if you want to take drone footage of the new Twitch studios
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:11.660]   be my guest leave the backdoor open to Luke and get him would you leave the back door open
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:17.980]   we have the nest cam thank god we have the nest cam okay there you go boy that's gripping
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:25.580]   gripping footage of the guy putting the carpet squares on the previously glued raised floor
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.500]   but a chat room monitor in the bathroom that way the chat room can tell john if you get
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:34.620]   locked oh that's a good idea that's an audio feed that people want to check in on that's a great idea
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:40.620]   just the chat room oh i'm stuck in the bathroom tell john tell karston
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:48.460]   that sounds like a great Arduino project just a big red button that when you slap it it just
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:52.540]   does nothing but like send something to the cat saying okay i'm not in the bathroom that's all we
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:57.820]   do we have a little uh we have a doorbell in effect that could be that it could be this that was easy
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:01.740]   button and she slap it and it's just orders more and then more toilet paper awry
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:12.620]   who used the dash button apple apple is fine apple give me a USB charger for a long time apple
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:19.260]   is chewed bug bounties yes uh saying this is a bad idea because it just encourages people to find
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:24.940]   bugs no because it is uh we don't want to get in the position of paying people to find bugs
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.220]   because we can't compete with the government which will give you a million bucks i don't know there
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:34.380]   are lots of reasons but they're doing it now weirdly though it's invite only explain that to me rinae
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.060]   i don't understand that so i had a chance to talk to the people behind the the program at
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:41.980]   mr apple and what they said is there's there's two things one is the reason they're doing it is
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.940]   because they feel like exploits are getting much more difficult to find as ios has been hardened
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:54.620]   it's it's rare that's a good spin oh our stuff has gotten so secure we've got to pay people
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:59.740]   to find bugs um like they would get more by the researcher putting up more spend time on their
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:04.700]   opponent they would just say they found a bomb on these so it's not it's not that the
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:09.820]   the amount of time a researcher a researcher was willing to spend on it was no longer significant
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.820]   because they would find one handed off go on to the next thing and what apple wants to do is
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:18.700]   establish a relationship and actually dedicate apple engineering resources to the people in this
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.940]   program and they want to start small and provide a very high level of service that you have dedicated
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.020]   people to talk to uh and they sort of that it may know that you know you you found this bug you're
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.620]   gonna hand it off they're gonna work with you on it and identifying it on patching it and then
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.540]   they're gonna grow the program over time but how much are they paying is it a lot of money it seems
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.460]   like a lot of money no it's it's for a company it's really good i mean i think it goes up to 500
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:46.860]   000 for some of the exploit uh sorry 200 000 for firmware uh secure boot exploit uh 100 000 for uh
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:52.860]   what is that extraction of confidential material in the secure life they'll never pay that
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:57.500]   bounty i don't think and it's up to there's two really cool things one is that if you decide like
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.180]   if you don't need the money you're gonna donate the charity apple can match the charitable donation
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.180]   yeah uh so it can be up to double this that's nice but also if you find a bug and you're not part
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.300]   of the program they'll still work with you it's not exclusive in any way it's just these are the
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.820]   people they're going to continuously be working with and if you find something just come and tell
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:16.620]   them and either they'll just work with you as a one-off or they'll invite you to join the program
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:22.540]   almost every other company does have a bug bounty program some of them quite public uh yeah
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:29.740]   and uh so this is i i understand apple's reluctance to bid up the the processing and one of the problems
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:35.820]   is you get people uh like dam kaminski for instance who every year would collect flaws so that he
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:40.300]   could win the pon-dome contest at kensek west and he did for many years so many so many i'm happy
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.060]   what you really want to do is give these people some incentive not to save up so they can get a
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:49.260]   free laptop but actually get some money uh so that they can reveal the bug to apple sooner and it
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.020]   also incense them not to reveal it publicly right yeah and it's a different kind of person so it's
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.860]   not i don't doesn't sound like they're really targeting someone who might already be working
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:01.900]   for organized crime or for you know a terrorist network or for a government for that matter it's
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:06.460]   people who really are researchers who are in it for doing security research and either they just
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:10.860]   need help they need resources or if they're already affluent they they just want to do something good
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.900]   like is people who want to do the right thing and disclose to the company in a responsible and
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:18.220]   ethical way and it's an in a way to either help them do that or sort of help fulfill one of their
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:23.500]   charitable wishes for doing that so it's apple style it's very small they're starting off
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.300]   toe in the water but i think that once they get a sense of doing it they'll scale it up yeah yeah
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:34.540]   uh um but do but do but do but what else the gun emoji i guess we should talk about that
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:41.660]   so they should i just gone with a phaser that's what uh who was it that did a phaser for a while
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:47.180]   google or somebody had a yeah or a con solos blaster a microsoft ironically switched the other way
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:52.220]   so you microsoft that's who did it right they had a phaser so uh there is an emoji a gun emoji now
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:57.340]   the way emojis work it's part of the Unicode specification so the Unicode consortium is
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:03.740]   who determines what emojis are available they don't actually give you a they give you a description
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:10.060]   they don't tell you what the emoji has to look like so twitter google apple microsoft everybody
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:17.740]   has their own emoji their own version uh apple decided uh in ios 10 to change what looked like um
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:25.180]   i guess a 38 police special something like that into a squirt gun a clearly a child's toy with
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:33.020]   an orange tip um and you know what that's that's exactly what you'd expect of those hippies but uh
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:40.380]   they live in apricot orchard but i think they're actually prune orchards but orchards but uh
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:45.420]   no literally i think that's the the whole silicon valley used to be prune orchards but uh in fact
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.380]   the the big mall near apple is called the prune yard nice not a great name for a mall i'm just
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:57.580]   saying but boy is it regular it's it's historic i used to get my haircut at the prune yard uh
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.180]   there is an interesting issue and the emoji pedia folks uh raise this issue
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:08.220]   which is it is more than a political statement you know and you change the gun for a squirt gun
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.900]   that's a political statement right and we want to make it family friendly or whatever and actually
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:19.100]   i thought it was a great idea they point out that because people on other platforms will see a
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:25.420]   realistic looking gun when you say and they give an example uh when you send a tweet that says hey
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:30.300]   we're gonna have a party at the local park two o'clock tomorrow bring your squirt guns
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:38.460]   two people on android ios 9 windows phone sam sangh it'll look like you're saying bring your
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:45.100]   real pistol i don't know is that a problem well it's not your contacts it's not it's not just
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:50.940]   that it's something that goes beyond just the gun emoji it's that you're you're crafting a message
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:57.260]   on your phone that before you click send makes perfect sense to you but then when you send it
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:03.980]   it might a different emoji might turn up that modifies even just in my in my new way the what the
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:10.460]   message that you're sending now here by the way is this also from moji pedia bring cookies and
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:16.460]   instead of cookies if you're using a samsung galaxy you get crackers oh my god people i mean
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:20.620]   this is such a good standard people are going to be people are going to be saying here's
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:25.660]   here's the shopping list i want you to emoji emoji emoji emoji emoji is emojis for a shopping list
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.340]   they're not even it's crackers it's going to be things like someone someone who is not
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:35.020]   who i don't know maybe a little bit non-sophisticated is going to reply to a text
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:41.260]   with some of some serious news with an emoji that they think means on their device means that
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:46.220]   i'm really really concerned and sorry for you but i'm angry at that person who did that wonderful
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:49.820]   that terrible thing that got you all said when it comes on their end it means
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:55.260]   it's there's a little and i probably that is arched on your end is actually double arched on
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.420]   theirs and it means that wow you're such a loser for even being offended by this thing that this
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:05.020]   sensible person did to you so it's i think emoji can't be it's it's a dangerous thing when it's
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:10.620]   used in term in place of real conversation as opposed to putting stickers on things i think
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:15.020]   stickers are more useful in that sense because they're explicitly hey i'm just decorating what i'm
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:19.580]   saying this is not the message i'm actually saying it would behoove you here's a interesting
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.300]   kind of link baby article from last year and motherboard what the emoji you're sending actually
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:31.580]   look like to your friends mega niel uh did actually collate different emojis from different platforms
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:39.180]   to to there is some disconnect you know i mean in you know um you could send a lady in a flamenco
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:45.340]   outfit and you could get some guy in a t-shirt dancing right um i think groover identified a
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:49.740]   really big problem and that is while apple changed the icon they did not align it with the water
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.460]   so now you just it's just impossible to actually make a so water's coming out the wrong way i know
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.620]   i mean this is apple there's supposed to be design my view remember is that when you squirt
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:04.140]   once somebody else squirting three times back at yourself but i would like unico to fix and maybe
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:09.340]   someone at apple can help me is i i need to be able to long press on the french fries and get
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:14.460]   poutine potato totts yeah baked potato and potato chips i think you're right it needs to be solved i
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:18.860]   think we need that absolutely like it's 2016 and i'm i'm sending french fries like an animal
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:26.380]   it is it is a deeper problem now that people are actually using another problem that i've uh
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:31.580]   that i've seen discussed is how do you do audible text based on this stuff there are standards for
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:36.140]   it but you have to make sure that your your first goal is not that you make this thing look cool
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:41.180]   graphically but that it absolutely matches the intent that uh people can't really super do it
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.500]   right exactly it's communication yeah they should have visual standards as well as just a description
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.180]   because it's something that if it is a standard it needs to be a standard so that i know that if i
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:53.180]   send and the grimacing face because it makes me like kind of nervous on ios he doesn't see me
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:57.340]   sticking my tongue out at i'm on android and wonder you know what do i do yeah that's a real
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:01.260]   communications problem and it will only be fixed by having visual standards but again if
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:05.100]   and again if i if i can't see the screen if i'm if i'm relying on the o_s to speak
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:09.100]   aloud to me what's on the screen that's even doubly more important i think that i don't know
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:12.540]   what happens i don't know if there's any sort of facility where if you do a hover or maybe a deep
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:16.780]   press action on an emoji it'll say here's what these here's what the standard of this describes
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:23.180]   this as is really what you want to do oh that's interesting in that uh interview uh with um
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:30.860]   uh tim cook from fast company uh there was uh huh i'll say that i i read it because it was
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:39.020]   it was linked uh so many places there was a really high ratio of pros the writer describing
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:44.140]   what the environment was like in the environment at apple the news three then there'd be like one
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:48.780]   quote about hey here's our how our best ball team is doing it's like okay and it was a lot of setup
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:52.780]   like apple is doomed but no it's not this problem is struggling but no it's not so it was a lot of
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:57.740]   that's a that's a now rick tesselli by the way is the the guy who wrote this article is the guy who
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:03.820]   also wrote i think probably the best book about steve jobs becoming steve jobs so it's not like
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:07.980]   this guy doesn't have a lot of experience he covered apple for uh is it the post-intelligence
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:13.660]   or for a seattle newspaper i think but he's been there for a while and he's he's a he's a very strong
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:20.380]   guy yeah but maybe it was a thin interview uh i don't interview ceos uh i don't like to interview
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:24.540]   ceos because they're very managed they know it's like he had good access though i mean he was sitting
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:30.060]   down he was in the cafe right yeah is in that well it depends i mean i've um i interviewed
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:35.420]   the uh ceo of vesos for an hour and it really was a conversation where there was a there was a
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:43.900]   PR person in the room but uh the her real her only interaction was when uh i had used an idiom
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.780]   that he didn't understand as a non-native english speaker and he translated a fairy translator
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:53.180]   it's very it's very it's very i've been dealing scott mcneely is always an adventure there are
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.540]   ceos who need to have like the PR person wants to be there to jump in front of them because i
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.580]   never know what they're going to say but uh somebody like tim cook uh a ceo who has self-control
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:08.620]   uh usually says nothing of interest except the company's uh talking points and is very adept at
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:13.340]   keeping those very on message yeah he's on message that's the way to put it however and he cute he's
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:18.860]   completely ill is canon a warrior that's where it hurts warrior's it's killing me hell if he was
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:23.580]   a little sad it was the day after the warriors lost the playoffs he said uh we made significant
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:29.100]   changes to all of our development processes because of the apple maps failure to all of us
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:33.820]   living in kubertina the maps here were pretty good the problem wasn't obvious to us we'll never be
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.780]   able to take it out to a large number of users to get feedback and that's why apple is now doing
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:45.580]   the public betas which i think uh is it that makes a lot of sense yeah they they they they missed it
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:51.500]   on maps they don't want to miss it again and maps was a really interesting case because the maps app
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:56.780]   itself was pretty well done but the data like it just the data aggregation sanitization presentation
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:00.780]   you would have malformed phone numbers you know it's just all these disparate sources
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:04.940]   just didn't get in there in any in any real usable way and that's a problem that beta testing
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:09.260]   absolutely would have identified for them did they call apple maps beta when they released it
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:15.420]   i don't recall they should have that might have made it right series
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.620]   still in beta isn't it i don't i think it's a beta for a long time yeah but you know there is nothing
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.380]   in like there is no no matter how confident there is no amount of q and a that can catch
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:29.100]   what a million ten million a hundred million people will find using your software in their
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:34.140]   day-to-day lives and their unique use cases and it just it is so valuable that if you as a company
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:37.900]   can set that up especially at apple scale totally not easy because you got to have someone you know
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.820]   intercepting all those bugs and uh checking them and making sure they get to the right place and
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:45.900]   you know getting rid of all the ones that are just random characters and things but if you can run
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:49.020]   that then your software is going to be so much better which is why i think it's great they're
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:55.100]   doing that for both ios and mac OS now yeah and not only that but it's a it's an advantage that
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:00.460]   uh google and uh so it's an advantage that google and microsoft has you in the disney it's a small
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:06.540]   world after all exhibit uh you can't tell because behind him it could be anything exactly no actually
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:13.900]   i recognize that ringtone i know exactly what that is um there's a uh there's an advantage that
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:18.300]   again i'm shocked that you use standard ringtones that's the first thing i change on an
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.940]   phone well that's well because that's how often i get an actual phone call there you go it's like
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:28.060]   it's the last thing i think to change right um and also i need something that i recognize i don't i
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:32.140]   don't want to have like my favorites i don't want if i have like a favorite song or favorite piece of
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:37.900]   music that i like if i attach that to a ringtone pep by pep lovian response after a month is like
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:43.660]   oh my god it's hey hey why is my calling me right i don't i don't know who's playing
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:47.740]   hey jude at me it's but i no longer have to now talk to someone that i know i was prepared to
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.300]   talk to a human being today i did that with boba o'Reilly uh the great hoo song it's a really good
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:57.100]   ringtone but it's spoiled the song forever for me so that's exactly yeah um i was like my my
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:02.460]   complex shop bought a new phone and was the same as the phone i had in my office and i almost and
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:07.740]   for like three months i had i literally bought a new phone for my office because every time i
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:13.180]   i'm at the complex store i'm just there to relax i'm taking a break and hear that the atd like
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:19.980]   i i i did i i know i found my story before i left the house oh god damn it what's wrong right it was
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:25.420]   wrong like okay i guess it's just the comic book this is the ringtone for the one plus one which i
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:31.340]   haven't changed actually because i kind of like it it's lovely it has to it's ringtones or it's
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:35.580]   i'd love to talk to someone who designs ringtones because you notice that the good ones have to like
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:40.220]   cover the entire range of human hearing because you don't know where someone's deficient right and
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.140]   so there's there must be such a science in it and i bet the people who are good at it are good in
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:50.300]   ways that those the rest of us can never figure out why they're so good at like a good jingle writer
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:57.660]   you actually that's why the marimba the original iPhone ringtone is is a classic literally and you
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:01.900]   still hear it on tv shows and stuff and you go oh yeah you mean shows are just cutting around the
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:08.460]   planet yeah but i know Andy has a Samsung phone somewhere nearby oh no it's a nexus oh nexus that's
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:14.540]   what it's yes um but all i was going to say is that in regards of releasing a new software it's a it's
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:22.220]   micro oftentimes the pain that we experience is in some way self-inflicted and in apple their
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:27.420]   secrecy and their refusal their their institutional idea of we don't talk about things until we actually
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.260]   ship them that's a pain that they have invited upon themselves google and microsoft can be at a
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:36.860]   developers conference and say here's something we're thinking about doing and we're basically and
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:40.300]   then three months later okay we're going to let 10 000 people use this new mail service that we
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:45.500]   don't that we're working on and so not only do they learn about that but the first waves of people
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:49.900]   know that this is not designed to be there's not necessarily the greatest finished polished
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:54.380]   thing that they've ever made this is something they're still working on uh and so it's it's so
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:30:00.380]   apple sometimes invites new pain upon themselves when the first time that we are officially aware
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:05.580]   that apple's working on a mapping product is when they're on the stage saying we honestly think this
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:11.500]   is the best mapping system that's ever been made like no it isn't because the Statue of Liberty isn't
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:17.820]   in Boston it's Boston Common that's the Soul Soldiers and Sailors Memorial I know because the
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:23.420]   postcards are totally different there uh now we have a little we've had a little time inside Andy's
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:29.500]   brain and I hope you've enjoyed it please uh i think if apple's gonna license it for the next show
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:36.220]   inside out with Andy and not go buy a t-shirt our show today we're gonna get get your
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:40.140]   a cut picks ready a gentleman our show we're gonna do those in a moment our show today brought to you
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:45.260]   by gazelle we are now the clock is ticking we believe we're less than 30 days away from a new
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:52.140]   iPhone why is that important because you want to kind of get your quote from gazelle at the maximum
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:57.580]   distance from the time you're gonna get the new phone because I know this is complicated but
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.940]   because the price of the phone is always going down a little bit every day right so the thing
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:07.900]   about the gazelle quote it's guaranteed it's locked in for 30 days so if you can this is this is what
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:12.140]   you want and I think you might you might be right in a position to do this if you can get that quote
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:17.020]   30 days before you're gonna buy a new phone and you're golden because you have that quote and they
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:21.820]   can't they cannot change it even though the price or the value of your phone is going down so if
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:27.260]   you think you're buying a new iPhone or a new device of any kind visit gazelle.com and at least get a
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:32.780]   quote if you get a quote then you know how much it's worth and you certainly don't want to throw
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.780]   that old phone in a drawer let it gather dust you wouldn't do that with a hundred dollar bill why
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:44.060]   would you do that with your phone for trade-ins shipping is free the payment is fast you can get
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:51.260]   check a PayPal credit or Amazon gift card and the reason I usually get that is because they bump
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:57.580]   it up by 5% so it's a little bit more valuable. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E go to gazelle.com to see what your

[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:28.140]   day to transfer okay obviously I'm overthinking this but you tell now you have a burner phone and
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:33.020]   then right the price is high and then okay you're right it's true you want to maximize the price
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:38.700]   Renee Richie you're pick of the wake so I just put it down behind me so this is all the fault of
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:42.300]   Serenity Caldwell. I'm going to blame her for a lot of things today is everything is every she bought
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:47.740]   a pair of these and then did a review on them the Bose QuietComfort 35 head phones everybody loves
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:52.380]   those. Yeah. Yeah, because like for you used to Bluetooth sort of sounding like the probe droid
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:56.460]   from empire, you know, bam, bam, bam, bam Bam, bam, bam, man, because it's the bandwidth is so
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:01.180]   insufficient. And because all the talk about apple jet is saying jettisoning the headphone jack,
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:06.060]   I wanted to try the state of Bluetooth headphones, and I had I tried the Beats ones and they were
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:10.620]   okay. And then I tried Serenity's headphones the last time I saw her she was in Montreal a couple
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:14.780]   weeks ago. And they were just fantastic. They sounded better than a lot of I guess any Bluetooth
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:19.100]   headphone I've heard before. So I picked up a pair of them they come in this very nice, you know,
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:24.060]   if you've used to Bose, they come in this very nice carrying case that's right in your pocket
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:28.620]   before you go on the airplane. But they're really nice phones and not exactly a style that would
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:33.820]   have gotten on my own. But the Bluetooth sound by itself, it's phenomenal. I'm not an audio file.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:38.780]   I don't have you know, Marco Armand ears for things like this. But I can tell when it's really badly
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.020]   distorted Bluetooth sound. And I started getting really interested in Bluetooth when the Apple TV
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:46.460]   had it because sometimes there's other people in the room and you just want to watch something
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.900]   or they're playing games or you know, they're just running around and noisy and you put them on and
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.580]   you're just watching your show and you don't have to worry about anything. And then the Apple watch
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:56.940]   of course doesn't have a headphone jack. So Bluetooth headphones really useful for those,
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.100]   but I had the little sporty ones. These just these feel like real grown up earphones. And this is
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:07.180]   just the guess the current state of Bluetooth. And I don't know if Apple will have any of their own
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:11.660]   proprietary magic that they'll layer on top of it. But even if they're if they're this good,
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:15.900]   I'll be pretty happy. I'm not happy with the battery life running out because it seems like
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:20.460]   just when you're really enjoying the noise canceling, it fails on you. And then the whole world comes
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:24.860]   crashing in again. But battery life is what it is. And they do have a little jack plug that you
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:28.940]   can use to put in normally like a normal set of earphones, you're not totally left out. But I
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.100]   was really pleasantly surprised. And I think if you are sort of if you really want Bluetooth
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:36.780]   headphones, you don't want ones that are just little sporty ones, you want actual cans you can
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:41.020]   put on your head and sound quality does matter to you. These are really, really good headphones.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:45.980]   Nice. And not cheap. 450 bucks. The future is never cheap. Yeah.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:50.940]   Comfortable? Yeah, very comfortable. I mean, they go sort of that they're,
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:55.980]   I mean, I would call them over the year, but I have big grappling mangled ears. So they kind of
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:59.420]   sit a little bit on for me, but I've had no problem with them. I have not that to take them off at all.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:03.580]   They don't have microphones though. I'm thinking because if iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack,
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:09.100]   some of us will probably turn to wireless headphones. They don't. I actually have never
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:12.620]   tried using I don't use my phone as a phone ever since Don Milton put a web browser on a phone.
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:17.980]   I just never use my phone. I know I know with you. But I think they might have because there is a
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:21.420]   little hole. Maybe I don't know. Maybe they do have a built in chat tested out. I think the hole
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:25.660]   is probably for the noise cancelation. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. That's probably true. Yeah.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:33.820]   Interesting. Yeah. I actually, if somebody has a recommendation to for headphones, wireless
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:39.660]   headphones that can also be used for talking into, but sound good for music, that's the problem.
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:44.620]   Usually those are different. In fact, like the battle cycle actica headset with two ears and the
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:50.860]   right. And it's also a different Bluetooth profile, isn't it? There's a 2DP for the high qualities.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.900]   Music, but you have to use the headset profile. Yeah. It Bluetooth hands free. There's like
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:37:01.100]   I think 12 different Bluetooth protocols. Huh. This might be something unsolved. Maybe Apple's
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:09.500]   solve it. I bet you there's a beats in your future. Hey, Andy, and not co. What do you got for us?
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:14.700]   A couple of weeks, I was pretty excited about the new version of Scrivener, my favorite word
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:20.700]   processor, making it to iOS. And a lot of people asked, well, what do you, what's there for
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.260]   between Scrivener and another popular text editor for iOS and for the Mac called Ulysses,
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:30.540]   because they're both the same kind of the same category where their, your interface is not
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:35.580]   necessarily I'm opening a doc, I'm closing a doc. So much as I'm opening a workspace that contains
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.940]   a bunch of documents that are organized together into folders. And this is my workspace for a
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:48.780]   specific project. The difference between Ulysses and and Scrivener is that Ulysses is specifically
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:54.860]   a text based editor. It doesn't allow a lot of the data types, a lot of the external PDFs, images,
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:03.660]   sound files. What I like to say is that Scrivener really is the is the electric guitar, the
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:09.500]   Ulysses is the acoustic guitar, but they're both really great tools for people who work on
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:13.100]   writing projects, as opposed to just dashing off little things, although they both work great for
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:19.660]   those things too. But Ulysses just released 2.6, a big upgrade in which they brought two great
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:27.100]   features to the iOS app. First, full access to Dropbox, Dropbox is an equal favorite nation's
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:31.980]   file source for the iOS app. So you can have all of your documents on Dropbox and use it on the
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:37.820]   Ulysses version, excuse me, the desktop version and the iOS version. And they also added integration
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:43.580]   with WordPress. So now you can write and publish direct to your WordPress blog, whether it's on
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:48.780]   WordPress.com or whether it's a self hosted blog directly from Ulysses. And it works really,
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.740]   really great. And they had a couple other enhancements too, but those two in itself are just huge,
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:57.980]   huge, huge moves forward. And they were really hard to implement as well as they did as they did
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:04.060]   here. And Ulysses, the other difference between Ulysses and Scrivener is that Ulysses is really
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:09.820]   one of those new revolutionary ideas where we're going to try to give you a writing environment
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:14.620]   that removes as many distractions as possible that lets you to really focus on what you're doing.
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:18.700]   And it works great on the Mac, but it works even better on iOS where you can't have overlapping
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.620]   windows and you can really just get right into the writing group. They actually added a couple of
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:27.500]   new features to both versions of it toward that event, toward that extent, where you can actually
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:32.220]   have it into not just typewriter mode where instead of the type of tap to tap scroll, type of tap,
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:37.900]   where the text scrolls up as you type. But you can also also have the tunnel vision where
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:42.380]   the only thing that's in clear sharp black and white focus is the line that you're actually writing.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.500]   So you're really not looking at what did I just write, do I need to fix that? You can only just
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:52.540]   really focus on the actual words you're typing at that time. And it sounds like a gimmick, but
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:57.660]   it's gimmicks that will get you to the end of your novel or the end of whatever report you have to
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:02.220]   write. So Ulysses is one of the greatest word processors you can buy on iOS or Mac, and this is
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:09.580]   a significant upgrade. And it's worth the, I think it's $20 I think. It's priced at $44 for
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:14.860]   the Mac version, $25 for the iOS version. And I'm glad that they're charging actual money for it.
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:19.340]   It's not a huge amount of money, but enough that you feel as though you're contributing to the
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:25.020]   value of the product and you're also helping the people who created it to pay their rent and raise
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:28.860]   their children, which makes me very happy. And in this case, the new features are worth the
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:33.020]   upgrade. Absolutely major, major upgrade. Again, particularly if you publish a WordPress, the
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:39.900]   WordPress has their own iOS app, but it's a little bit weird. I've never really enjoyed using it. I
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:45.340]   always use the web interface. And I've been using the using Ulysses to put things on to the
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:51.260]   sometimes WordPress site. And it's been really, it feels as though you are, you are
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:55.660]   for prefect publishing something to the Hitchhiker's Guide, you've written something, you press a
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:00.300]   button, it's on the CMS, you're done, as opposed to, okay, now I'm going to call my editor or send
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:05.020]   him a text message and see if he knows, see if he sees this on the server yet. So it's,
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:11.900]   it's tough. I have to say I really praise WordPress for having an API. I think that's so great. It
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:17.420]   means there's a lot of, well, remember Daniel Jalka, there's others who made great blogging
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:24.780]   programs because there's an API. Yeah. You weren't, you weren't, you even you as the creator of,
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:30.780]   of a resource are not possible of seeing all the awesome that's possible inside that resource.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:34.780]   It's only other people that can help you find the awesome. That's why you have open APIs.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:41.260]   Open, open, open, open eyes. Find the awesome. I like it. I have a certain, a new search engine.
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:45.420]   Wait a minute. What? Who, you know, do we need a new search engine?
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:48.060]   Alta Vista. Yeah, Alta Vista is back, baby.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.220]   Now, this is kind of interesting. The guy who created Twitter and Blogger before it, F Williams,
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:57.900]   has a new company called Jelly. Ask Jelly and it's kind of a search engine meets Quora.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:04.060]   But by itself, I mean, you know, if you go to askjelly.com, you can, you can query things.
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:09.580]   And humans answer, right? Which is, and so you get kind of interesting things, but this is why,
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:12.940]   this is, this has been around for, I don't know, a few months.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.860]   But the thing that really got me is the askjelly Chrome
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:23.900]   extension, because now when you do searches on Google, if there's a jelly answer, you'll get it.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:30.780]   Today is No Man's Sky Day today, right? And everybody's all talking about it. So I was doing
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:35.180]   a search on No Man's Sky, praying, hoping there'd be a Mac version. No, there's not.
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:40.460]   Praying, hoping there'd be an Xbox version. No, there's not, it's not on any of the things I have.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:45.900]   The PlayStation 4 comes out today and a few days later, we'll see a PC version.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.140]   But when I did the search, they asked Jelly,
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:55.020]   plug in, added a little thing in the sidebar, which was a jelly question comparing another game,
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:43:00.460]   which I'd never heard of, and a response, which is really awesome. So Google's always done,
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:05.820]   you know, these sidebar knowledge graph things. But this is an additional element that is added
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:10.380]   via Chrome extension. And turning it on is kind of cool. Every once in a while, you'll get
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:17.020]   some additional information to your search from a human being who's actually got an idea. It's
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:23.980]   from askjelly.com, and it's in the Chrome extensions library, and it's free. And it's kind of a nice
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:28.940]   thing to have hanging around. I don't think I'm ever going to go to a separate site and ask a
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:34.540]   question, you know, or do a search or questions. But the fact that they pop up in my search results,
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:39.900]   that's pretty cool, pretty cool. Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of another
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:48.700]   fabulous episode. I think Andy and Aco for talking me down from the ledge, as always.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.300]   Don't worry, there are other ledges. There are many, there's many alleged.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:58.380]   If you go to the Chicago, sometimes you're sure to read his byline from time to time, covering
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:04.460]   technology topics in his website, C w O B dot com. Follow him on Twitter, I H N A T K O.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:10.300]   And he's got a great flicker feed of images. He's a great photographer.

[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:23.820]   a podcast about Google, which is on replay dot FM, right? Yep. And on five by five,
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:29.260]   you're still doing a knock goes on the neck. Yep. Although we have big, big news coming, not the
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:34.540]   next show, but the show after that. So definitely tune in for that ones. Go to five by five and
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:41.500]   look for the knock. Oh, yeah, there's a tease. Big boy. Was I being a tease? Well, why?
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:48.300]   Also, Renee Richie from i'm or calm. It is the place to go to learn how to use your Mac better
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:54.460]   or Pokemon. It is it's a great site with lots of great information. I'm more calm. And he has his
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:45:00.860]   own podcast, including the brand new one, Apple Talk with with serenity. Yes, I heard it in Michael
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:04.780]   Gartenberg. We talked about the iPad story today should be out tomorrow. Excellent, excellent stuff.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:10.540]   Oh, you do two podcasts in one day. I'm your second. No, you never let secondly.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:15.660]   But man, the main event is that's the warm up podcast. We'll call it that.
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:21.580]   Thank you very much for joining us. We do Mac break weekly 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:27.340]   1800 UTC every Tuesday on the Twit network. You can watch live at twit.tv/live or
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:32.620]   in the alternate player at live.twit.tv for people who have trouble with the first.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:38.940]   There's always the second and the chat room is always open 24/7 for you to chat in irc.twit.tv.
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:44.620]   And I want to really give a tip of the hat to the community moderators. They're self-nominated.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:48.380]   They come out of the community and they do a great job making that chat family friendly and fun.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:54.460]   So tip your moderators and enjoy the view. I don't think they even accept tips. I tried to
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:46:01.420]   pay them and they said no, but they're just great. That's irc.twit.tv. Of course, you can
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:05.420]   also get the show on demand everywhere that you get podcasts, including our own website,
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:13.260]   slash mbw. If you'd like to see the brick house before it's whittled away to nothing, hurry.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:18.300]   Email tickets at twit.tv will make sure you get in and get a tour and get the show and get to see
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:25.340]   what's going on. And as I mentioned, on August 21st, little less than two weeks from today,
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:30.860]   we will be moving. So if you have tickets to see a show after that, go to the East Side
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:36.540]   studios. Moving on up to the East Side studios. I would wear socks though because that
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:41.500]   stick on looks pretty. Look at that. They're going to finish that before we finish the show.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:47.100]   You like that carpet? Looks good, huh? Nice charcoal. Yeah. Something neutral.
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.860]   Well, I mean, a petaluma in two months. You can still stuff by the brick house,
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:56.220]   but you'll be getting your nails done. Actually, no, it's a brewery. There's a brewery coming in here.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:00.380]   They're going to they're going to have giant vats of hops and malton.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.580]   So we're about a different kind of party. It'll smell the same though.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:12.700]   That's the amazing thing. Thanks for joining us back to work break time. Sorry.
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:19.660]   [Music]
