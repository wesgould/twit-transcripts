[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880]   This is Mac Break Weekly, the show where we talk
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.120]   about things Macintosh and Apple,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.600]   which includes the iPod, the iPhone, the Apple TV,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120]   and of course the Mac.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.840]   On the line with me right now.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   From beautiful Massachusetts, the Boston area,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.480]   Mr. Andy Inoco of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.720]   Hi, Andy.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.520]   >> Hello, Leo. Hello, everybody else.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.600]   This is a great day to be freezing cold
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.360]   and looking at a fair and first noise plant.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.080]   >> What is this, like 19 degrees, right?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.760]   And Boston is freezing.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.400]   They just, the seasonably crisp cold weather
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.240]   that we usually have trucked in for the tourists in August,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.800]   in October and September, just for the leaf peeping.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.040]   Unfortunately, they're back-oated.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.640]   So we got all that slightly crisp weather
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.840]   all at once in three days.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.720]   >> I hate it when that happens.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.840]   >> There are a lot of just like birds
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.680]   that are on the fence posts outside
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.080]   that haven't moved in a really weirdly long time.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.520]   >> They'll move come spring.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   They'll flop over.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   >> We're hoping exactly.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160]   Well, I'm hoping that we'll, you know,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.480]   I know I don't want to know.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.520]   I've had to do the day so far.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.040]   And I don't have that many shoe boxes
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.840]   and I won't be able to dig anything in the backyard
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.680]   until April anyway.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   >> Hundreds of little crosses in the backyard.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.040]   >> Scott Born is here.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280]   He's a birder and cringing as we speak.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.360]   Hi, Scott. >> Yeah.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.200]   >> Hello.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.440]   >> I just came back from photographing lots of birds.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.360]   >> Were you, where did you go this time?
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.560]   >> Folscé de la Pache, the wildlife refuge
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.360]   I spend everything it's giving at in central New Mexico.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.480]   >> Wow.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.640]   >> You do that, that's your Thanksgiving ritual?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.880]   >> I've done it 16 of the last 17 years.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.320]   >> Wow.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.920]   >> That is so cool.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.760]   >> That is so cool.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   >> And we had a nice thanks to a bunch
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.760]   of the world's top bird photographers.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.640]   Had a nice Thanksgiving dinner and then went down.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.720]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.160]   Did you eat a turkey?
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> We did.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   >> He shoots birds and he eats birds.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.120]   We shoot birds with guns and not.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.960]   >> No.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.720]   >> The nice people at the Luna Mansion
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   killed the bird for us.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.560]   We just ate it.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.920]   >> You don't see any irony in there yet?
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.760]   >> I do not.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.600]   >> I do not.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   >> I do not.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.480]   >> As a carnivore.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.520]   You don't mind being the type of the Folscé.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.320]   >> No, I passed a cattle truck on the way to McDonald's
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   when I was driving home.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.000]   I don't know if there was any relation, actually, in that case.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.160]   Also, Scott, by the way, the host of Twip Photo at TwipPhoto.com
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.120]   and does a lot of great photography seminars
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.240]   and workshops and so forth.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.680]   What's the best place to find out about those, Scott?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.360]   >> Well, I talk about them on the Twitter.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880]   It's got born and also a Twip Photo.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.960]   And by the way, I'm just the co-host
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.680]   because Alex is the other very integral part of that show.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.040]   >> You know, it's funny, irony.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.600]   And Alex is here, by the way, from Tokyo,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.640]   where it's 4 in the morning.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.160]   Hi, Alex.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.280]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.040]   Wow.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.440]   Boy, that's generous of you.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.680]   It's ironic.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   And I don't know if that has something to do with the Macintosh
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.800]   that all four of us are camera bugs, some better than others.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.280]   >> Well, you know, we did a survey about that, Leo.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.640]   And it's absolutely, positively true
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.600]   that Macintosh users are far more inclined
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.520]   to be into digital photography than Windows users.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.760]   >> They're into everything content creation-wise, I would say.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.000]   Mac users listen to more podcasts.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.840]   They create more podcasts.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.640]   They create more video.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.440]   >> And of course, some of this has to do with the fact
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.960]   that when you buy a Mac and you press the on button,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.520]   all the tools necessary to do that stuff are included.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.720]   >> You know, it also could be that
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.560]   creative types are attracted to the Mac.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.600]   It's so tense, you know, it could go the other direction as well.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.120]   Certainly, that's the recommendation.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.280]   Anybody calls me and says, you know, what should I get?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.960]   And they say, I want to do video editing or photography
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.080]   or graphics or web design.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.600]   I say Mac.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.800]   >> But Alex, you've probably used a lot of Windows stuff too, right?
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.080]   >> The only Windows that we use is really some,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.120]   a handful of 3D products, you know,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.520]   for, you know, and then some really obscure
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.440]   molecular modeling programs for some of the science
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.800]   visualizations. >> Stuff you just can't get on the Mac.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.640]   >> Yeah, yeah, but outside of that, I mean, that's why we have the,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.760]   you know, we do install fusion on all the machines of the office.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.680]   And that's really the only reason that we do it.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   And for the most part, that we don't.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.600]   I don't use it very often.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.120]   I mean, I open it up every once in a while to get to something.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.320]   But I was talking to a photographer here in Tokyo.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.800]   And I was like, why are all these drives formatted in FAT32?
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.760]   I was, you know, because there's all kinds of transfer issues with FAT32.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   And he's like, oh, I have PC.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.840]   And I was like, whoo, that's like, that's, to me,
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.040]   is still the single biggest problem is that Mac won't read NTFS
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.240]   with that additional software or NPCs won't read HFS
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.120]   with that additional software.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   And of course, FAT32, you can't get bigger than 2G
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.560]   but by file. So you have to choose one.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.480]   >> Well, the other thing is that it's FAT32 is we're, I mean,
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.760]   I don't know, this is a common thing, but we're having all kinds
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.880]   of read problems with it.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.320]   So if you have, if you, if you, it seems like if you copy too much
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.600]   at one time, it just, well, it's a pretty cool file system.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.400]   Yeah. Yeah. So it's a mess.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   >> What do you do?
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.880]   >> It's all stems from the fact that 22 years ago when I was 32
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.600]   and they named this after me, they didn't give me my royalty.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.440]   >> Scott file system? The FAT32?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.120]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.080]   >> I put a softball, I don't know the middle of the plate.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.920]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.520]   >> I didn't get that.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.880]   >> So much is the respect that Leo has for you, Scott.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.720]   >> I didn't want to.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.480]   >> He did not even interpret that as possibly a slam against him.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.680]   >> I didn't go there.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.240]   >> I didn't go there.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.880]   >> You know, I'm president of the horizontally challenged photographers
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.920]   of America, of which there are a few.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.960]   What is the best choice?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.680]   Is it to use Mac fuse on a Mac to allow it to read write NTFS
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.880]   or to get something like media force, what do they call it,
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.480]   Mac drive on the PC to read HFS plus?
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.560]   Which way is the best way to go?
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.400]   Andy, do you have an opinion on that?
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.720]   >> I've, I don't really use it that often.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.400]   >> You don't need to.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.520]   >> All right, maybe I'll ask Alex.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.640]   Alex, do you?
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.200]   >> I prefer to do it on the Mac.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.880]   >> Use Mac fuse.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.280]   Mac fuse is free.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.880]   >> Yeah, I mean, I just ask in the PC to do something more complicated.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.040]   It's always kind of--
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.160]   >> And I don't want to make it think that hard.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.800]   I just do what you do and we'll fix it over here.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.600]   That's kind of our general process with the PC.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.720]   >> VMware comes with Mac fuse, but it's free download from--
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.360]   for I think it's a Google site.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.840]   >> But it works pretty well.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.440]   I haven't had any problems with it.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.680]   But I don't, it just makes me nervous to have to do that.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.280]   But I guess I'll live with it.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.400]   >> I mean, what's nice is with something like Fusion or Parallels,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.440]   you know, you can--
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.200]   what's nice is you can just transfer the stuff back and forth.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.040]   >> Yeah, they don't care.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.080]   Or network file systems.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.120]   They don't care either.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.720]   >> Yeah, so you can just go back and forth from your PC side.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   >> Right, and we use network.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.600]   We use a lot of file sharing network and trash storage and stuff,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.120]   so we don't think about it that much.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.000]   But there-- but when I'm recording video,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.880]   I have to do it directly to a hard drive.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.240]   I can't do it over the network.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.400]   And then we want to unplug that hard drive and put it on a Mac.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.560]   And that's when we get-- that's when our troubles began.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.440]   So I've been delaying waiting, hoping that while we've been talking,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.000]   we record this on Tuesdays that the rumor from Apple Insider
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.800]   that the iTunes Music Store would go DRM-free.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.960]   I was just waiting and hoping that would happen while we're talking.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.000]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.080]   >> But you know what did happen?
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.880]   >> What?
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.400]   >> MacFuse 2.0 was released.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.800]   >> Oh, OK.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.200]   >> They knew.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.840]   They knew they saw us coming.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.800]   So I don't know.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.320]   Do you think this is bogus or whatever?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.440]   It's a French technology site was the first to say.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.280]   The Lech-Pong Le-Bois.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.520]   >> bogus because the record companies aren't going to let it happen.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.200]   >> They have Sony Universal and Warner,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:58.400]   which currently offer unprotected music through Amazon and other sites.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.680]   I've never let Apple do it.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.680]   But the rumor was that it would-- for the holidays,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.400]   Apple would remove DRM from those company's music today.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.600]   >> Yeah, I mean, it's the sentence that Apple's going to remove the DRM,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.800]   as opposed to that's going to be something that's negotiated with Mexican wrestlers
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.040]   in a no-holds bar competition before they'll get that sort of concession.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.600]   The whole reason why the Amazon MP3 store exists is because the record company wants
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.840]   a competition-- wants to be-- wants to be competition to Apple.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.160]   And DRM-free music is the biggest leverage that the Amazon store has.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.800]   >> Well, I'm reading on.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.160]   And the same site says that Apple will follow up the move with a promo campaign
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.200]   called The 12 Days of iTunes that will let shoppers in France, Germany,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   and the UK download an unlimited amount of content.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.800]   >> Those will play really great on the $49 iPhone.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.160]   That's only going to be sold at $7.11 starting tomorrow.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.880]   >> Yeah, right.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.840]   >> I'm looking forward to that.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.560]   >> I thought that was at Walmart.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.360]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.600]   >> No, no, that's the rumor because $99 is way too much to spend on an iPhone.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.040]   And why would Apple just partner with one store like that?
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   If they're going to do one store, they're going to go to Methodics or
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.360]   looking to buy a phone at 2 AM at 4 o'clock.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.040]   >> There you go.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.320]   They're going to start making burners.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.600]   iPhones you throw away when you've used up the minutes.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.120]   That's what they're going to do.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.680]   Now, we'll get to that story in a second.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.960]   I've seen that news says that the story's untrue.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.000]   You agree that it's unlikely that DRM-free will ever come to the iTunes store.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.960]   It sounds like you don't believe in the sky.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.640]   And you know more probably than any of us since you've had to deal with the record
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.440]   companies in your lifetime.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.560]   >> Listen, there are three entities you should fear in life.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.400]   One is the IRS.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.080]   >> The other is the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.440]   >> And the third is the Recording Industry of America.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   >> Yeah, I agree.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.360]   >> They all three should be looked at as the same.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.080]   The first two can take all of your stuff without due process.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.880]   So only way you can lose possessions in the United States without due process
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.400]   is if the SEC or the IRS come for them.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.880]   And the RIA is trying to get that power.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.360]   >> Yeah, they're getting close.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.400]   No, I don't see it because they don't understand the benefits.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.840]   They don't trust their customers.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.240]   That's their first problem.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.040]   They don't understand the benefits that digital music provide.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.520]   They don't understand that making this stuff easy to afford and
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.680]   obtain would actually stop the piracy.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.440]   But I do certainly understand the need to support and protect
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.280]   copyrighted material.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.960]   There's a balance in how to do that.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.400]   I think they've never ever come close to finding it.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.280]   >> Yeah, well, DRM, we all know it doesn't work.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.680]   It only stops honest users.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.640]   It doesn't stop thieves because it's a simple thing, trivial thing to remove it.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.160]   Or--
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   >> I think the media industries are reeling across the board from not
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.160]   embracing the digital opportunities that they have.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.600]   Whether it's--
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.200]   >> Well, I'll give you a side story.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.080]   >> Or so on and so forth.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.920]   All of these guys are contracting because they're not taking advantage of it.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.400]   I'm here in Tokyo.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.280]   And of course, you get up to Hulu and nothing works.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.800]   >> Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.720]   That just encourages you to go to Pirate Bay and download this thing.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.600]   >> I know I just Twittered and everyone just goes,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.040]   "Oh, use Hot Spot Shield."
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.120]   >> Or fake it.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.480]   >> And then you're like, "I'm like, thank you."
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   And you put that in.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.560]   And then 15 minutes later, I'm watching whatever I want to watch.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.560]   >> Which is my point.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.680]   That circumvention technology's always keep ahead of the anti-circumvention stuff.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.480]   And/or the anti-piracy stuff.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:44.440]   And it's only honest users or naive users who get florted by DRM.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.520]   And those are the ones who call me saying, "I just bought an iPod and all the music I
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.320]   bought on the rhapsody won't play on it.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.040]   What do I do?"
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   And you have to say, "Sorry, it doesn't work."
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.160]   >> That's called copy protection.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.600]   Greg Sandoval, who actually trusts and is a really good reliable reporter for a CNET,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.360]   says he contacted the record companies.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.720]   He says, "As of Monday afternoon, yes, apples and negotiations with the Universal
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.080]   Sony and Warner, but none of the deals is final and unlikely anything would be announced
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.640]   before the end of the year.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.800]   Apple's not saying anything officially."
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   That makes sense.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.640]   But this is the kind of thing, if it were true, since we've all been kind of wondering what's
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.920]   going to happen at Macworld, this would be the kind of thing they would announce there.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.640]   >> That'd be huge.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.080]   And meanwhile, Alex Stilz shops Amazon.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.040]   >> I've moved on.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.080]   I had these obscure songs that I can't play.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.640]   I can't figure out how I own them before and now I don't own them on iTunes.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.360]   Because I change computers often enough that it becomes a pain.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.440]   And I've stopped.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.200]   I don't buy anything from iTunes anymore.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.240]   >> Unless I can get it on.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.520]   >> I still buy video there.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.720]   >> No, no, I buy a video.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.680]   I buy tons of video on iTunes.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   But I mean, I don't buy any--
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.680]   >> But no music.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   >> No, I don't buy music.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   >> Or music.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.440]   >> Unless I'm, you know, like it's 99 cents and I just want it now for my slideshow or
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.000]   whatever, then I might do it.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> Right.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   But I still--
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.800]   >> But now I'm there because it's just easy.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.480]   >> Well, that's why they continue to succeed, right?
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.160]   >> Why is it the record companies that don't-- it's been my opinion.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.080]   Maybe we've talked about this before, but let's just one more time address it.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.440]   The record companies are trying to loosen the grip that iTunes and Apple have on the
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.680]   music industry by making them operate at this advantage.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.880]   And that's why they'll never remove copy protection.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.160]   >> I don't know if it's never, but the main thing is that they suddenly realize that,
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.520]   you know, kind of the monster they created when they started going into the next round
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.960]   of negotiations and Apple has, you know, owns 90% of the online market.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.520]   And they're now the largest reseller of music.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   And, you know, Steve says, "This is the way we want to do it."
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.760]   You know, and what they're creating is basically-- I mean, this isn't a relationship that doesn't
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   exist other places.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.200]   If you talk to retailers who work, for instance, with Walmart, Walmart tells them, you know,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.360]   "And Walmart knows what their margins are and tells them what they're going to pay for
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.760]   their product and tells them how to package it and tells them how to-- you know, this
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.160]   is how we want to see it and so on and so forth.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.360]   And what the record industry is trying to do is avoid having that relationship with Apple.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.640]   I don't know if it's inevitable or not because, I mean, Apple, right now, I mean, and I've
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.600]   said this a thousand times, until someone really builds a great net app that serves up
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.480]   media, they're not going to compete with iTunes.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.080]   You know, the web-- the web stuff will always do fine, but I don't think-- I just don't
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.720]   think it'll catch up.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.640]   >> Well, it's not over yet.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.680]   I keep checking iTunes only.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.400]   It's not over yet.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.800]   So the other big story, and you alluded to it, Annie and not go.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.040]   And it was a rumor.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.360]   Is it true that Walmart will be selling iPhones for $99?
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.200]   Have that-- has that been confirmed yet?
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.280]   >> No, I think that's ridiculous.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.800]   I do think that Walmart's going to start selling iPhones at some point.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.960]   >> For $200, just like everybody else.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   >> Exactly.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.800]   But I mean, Alex sort of touched on it.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.640]   Apple and Walmart are the-- in terms of huge companies are the two biggest-- have the two
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.160]   best reputations for saying, look, here's how we're going to do business with you and
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   know these points are non-negotiable if you want to do business with us.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   Here's how you do it.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.520]   And so you basically have two unstoppable forces working together, and that just doesn't
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   happen.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.520]   I mean, Walmart, like, it would be great for the first year, and Walmart would go back
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.280]   to Apple and say, we love selling those $99 phones.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.360]   Now we want to solve them for $49.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.600]   And then when Apple says, no, we can't, he said, well, sure, sure, sure, just take out
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.120]   the color screen, give it a black and white screen.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   Sixteen levels of gray.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   >> Yeah, Apple and could do that.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.120]   >> Apple and could do that.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.800]   >> And Apple would never let them sell a phone for half what Apple's selling it for in its
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.280]   own stores or AT&T selling it at its own stores.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.440]   Why would anybody go to Apple stores or AT&T stores to buy a phone anymore?
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.080]   >> Yeah, I mean, there's a way that part of the rumor says that it's going to be either
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.960]   a four gigabyte or an eight gigabyte phone phone.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.280]   The four gigabytes, that makes it, I don't know, maybe from zero percent plausible to
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.200]   two percent plausible because four gigabytes on an iPhone is next to useless.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.640]   So they could be saying, well, look, we're going to do a cheap one, then we're going
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.920]   to brand it differently, we're going to color it differently so that as you sit in the subway
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.080]   using this, everybody will know that you have the cheap purple Walmart iPhone and not the
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.520]   real one.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.000]   But it's just not, if Apple's going to make a $99 iPhone, why are they going to do it
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   just through Walmart?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.640]   They're going to put that as just part of the standard product line.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   >> Right.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.840]   >> I do have to say, though, it would be devastating to the smartphone market if any kind of iPhone
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.920]   came out at $99.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.120]   I know my wife has been, you know, I've been pushing very hard for her to get an iPhone
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.600]   because I'm tired of the phone.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.200]   >> She still doesn't have an iPhone?
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.680]   No, she doesn't have an iPhone.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   What the hell?
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   >> And so she--
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.840]   >> Scrips for $19.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   >> But $199.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.920]   $199, you know, she just thinks that's a little too much for a phone because she's used to
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.800]   getting something that's a little less.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.360]   At $99, I think that her and, you know, an enormous percentage of other people would,
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.720]   I mean, we saw a huge explosion when the price dropped to $199.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   And I think that at $99--
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   >> Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.520]   >> It would devastate the smartphone market.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.200]   It's not that it won't happen, but it'll happen market-wide, not at Walmart only.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   >> And it won't happen this year.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.760]   It'll happen next year when they want to--
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.760]   >> They're getting a great boost at a $199.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.240]   >> I'm just going to put the shuffle.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.320]   >> Apple doesn't need them to sell a bunch of iPhones.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   They've proven that.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   >> It doesn't need Walmart.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   They're doing quite well without them, thank you.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.280]   I just don't see any reason for them to make any-- why would they want to give up?
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:38.200]   They'd have to give up some piece of pie on something that's responsible for 25% of their
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   revenue.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   >> That makes sense.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.080]   >> We're going to talk a little bit about Macworld Expo.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.720]   All of us will be there doing various things, but there are two very big companies who won't
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   be there.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.080]   Could it be a Grinch-like Macworld Expo?
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.920]   We're going to talk about that in just a second, but first I want to mention our good
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.520]   friends at robo.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.560]   I'm just going to play this song because it just makes me feel Drobo-licious.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.320]   >> Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:12.040]   >> Drobo's the fantastic USB or now Firewire 800 external hard drive that can hold so much
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   data.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   Why?
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.400]   Because the Drobo allows you to put four S.A.T.A. drives in its fantastic enclosure.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.000]   Four drives that can hold up to-- what is it?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   What's the maximum now?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I think 16 terabytes.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.960]   Nobody's making a drive that big.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.320]   >> The Drobo itself is configured for when that's available to go to 16.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.040]   >> Four terabyte drives.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.440]   But even now with the one terabyte drives, you get four terabytes total storage.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.160]   Now the good news about Drobo is your data is redundant.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.400]   So a proportion of that usually was about a one quarter to one third of the total amount
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.960]   is set aside to kind of back up your data automatically.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.680]   So if you lose a drive, no big deal.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.120]   You slot in another drive.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.920]   The Drobo rebuilds and bam.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   You're bam.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920]   Boom.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   That's an active action.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.840]   Actually, you're back to action even while the Drobo is rebuilding.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.360]   You never lose a minute.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.440]   Never down for a minute.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.840]   >> What's incredible now is the drives have gotten-- the raw drives have become so inexpensive.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   I mean, we--
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.440]   >> We're buying terabyte drives for 109 bucks now.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   >> They're 99 now.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   A new egg.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   >> A new egg.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   >> They went down to 99?
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   Wow.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   >> 99 bucks.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   And now I have learned that there's a lot of difference between the speeds of them, but
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.080]   it doesn't really matter if you're doing backup.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   You know, if you--
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   >> Not a Drobo, no.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.320]   It's educated on the difference between the caviar blue, green, and black.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   >> And so--
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   >> Well, I'm getting pretty good.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.760]   I think these are pretty good Hitachi drives for 99 bucks from a new egg.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   And then one of the things--
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   >> And the one point five--
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.760]   >> They're 130.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   >> One of the things to remember too, Leo, is that certain drives are more quiet than
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   others.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   >> Right.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.760]   Right.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.760]   >> Western Digital's the quietest ones I've tested.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.760]   >> Is that what you guys are using?
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   Okay, Western Digital's.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.400]   >> Yeah, I've got 64 of them now.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   >> 64 drives.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.920]   >> Yeah, because I have a lot of Drobo's.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   >> That's eight.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.640]   >> That's because I have a lot of pictures to put on my Drobo's.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.560]   >> Wait, I'm trying to do the math here.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560]   Is that--
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.440]   That's 12-- how many Drobo's is that?
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.440]   I've got like 20.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.040]   I haven't got them all hooked up.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.040]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   >> What is--
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   >> Well, let's do the math.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.600]   3, 6, 9.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.240]   You are only six away from being able to build an actual Rubik's cube of Drobo's.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.640]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.080]   >> You should do it just paint.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.400]   >> And then you color the little faces, you know, because those faces pop off, so you could
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.640]   spray paint them.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.880]   And then you could just kind of set them off.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.040]   >> You could really-- oh, come on.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.600]   You'd get a lot of coverage.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.800]   You'd be on dig for sure.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   >> Okay, I'm going to do it.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   >> Drobo's cube.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.680]   >> I'm going to put some of my photos on the face plate, though.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   >> That's a great idea.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   >> There you go.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   >> Okay, well--
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.120]   >> Actually, maybe I'll do one of those things where you take a giant photo and you break
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.920]   it into smaller parts to make the big photo and put them on the face plates.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.640]   >> Frankly, you should be doing these ads, not me.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.240]   If you only have two Drobo's, you have 20 Drobo's.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   >> Holy cow.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   >> I got Drobo's laying around in the hall.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.960]   He's got Drobo's everywhere.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.720]   This is a man who loves his Drobo.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.800]   You're going to love it, too.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.240]   Now with Firewire 800 and USB 2.0, Drobo is fast, redundant, reliable, affordable, in
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:17.400]   fact, you'll save $50 right now on the new Firewire 800 Drobo through December 21, 2008,
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   so do not delay.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   Act today.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.640]   This would be a-- if you're looking for a gift for the Mac lover in your life and you've
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.560]   just tuned in this podcast just because you figure, oh, they'll say something that'll
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.000]   make-- that'll give me an idea.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.720]   This is the idea.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.680]   Nobody ever says boo to a Drobo.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.240]   Even if you already have 19, that 20th Drobo is just as fun.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.160]   >> I will say that there's no way to say, "I love you better than to help somebody protect
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   their data."
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   >> That's a good point.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   >> I mean, this is--
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   >> I mean, this is--

[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.160]   They might actually be able to do crap.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   >> Well, let's hope, because, you know,
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   around this time, that's when I start pulling out, you know,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   we're not going to get my meals from.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.160]   >> We're going to be very much there at Mackerel.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   Mac break weekly is not, I want to announce it today,
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   pulling out of Mackerel in any way.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   We're putting it in.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   Wait a minute, that sounds wrong.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   >> We're --
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   >> Go say that.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   >> Go say that more slowly.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.160]   >> I didn't mean to say it that quite that way.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   >> My list news.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   Can't get enough of my show, baby.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   >> Oh, baby, you know, I love.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   >> This week on the Playboy Channel.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   >> We are.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   So let's go around the table and tell everybody where we're
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   going to be.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   I'll start.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   We're going to do Mac break weekly, a special edition from the
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   show floor on Tuesday shortly after the keynote speech.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   I think we're talking -- we haven't settled the details yet,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   Alex, but I think it's noon.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   Is that what we were talking about with Paul?
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   >> It's noon, and I just don't have the final location.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   >> We don't know the location.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   We'll be on the show floor, so you'll need to have an exhibit
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.160]   pass.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   But you don't need a conference pass.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   You need an exhibit pass to see that.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   And they're 25 bucks or less if you shop around.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.160]   >> And you get it for free for a lot from a lot of vendors.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160]   >> A lot of vendors, yeah, for free.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   And then I'm going to do a feature presentation 9am on
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   Thursday, title, content, slides to be determined in a
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   later day.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   But I'm thinking about it right now.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   >> I'm thinking.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.160]   >> No, I'm going to talk --
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   >> It's a long drive down San Francisco.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   >> Plenty of time.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   I'm more prepared than I usually am.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   I hired someone to work with me on it.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   Sarah Lane said I work in the gather clips.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.160]   I am going to talk about media, new media.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   That's the one thing I know something about is content
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   delivery, comparing and contrasting the good old or
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.160]   battle days of media with what's going on today and where I
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   think we're going to go in the future.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   That will be the general subject matter.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   Also, Alex, you're going to be there, I know, in force
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.160]   with the Pixel Core, which we're going to be shooting.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.160]   We're going to have either two or three crews shooting on
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   the floor.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   So you'll see our guys wandering around with cameras and
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   different hosts.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   And we've got a ton of hosts, a lot of them from last year
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   are going to be in there.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   And we're going to be shooting somewhere in the vicinity of
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   somewhere between 40 and 100 episodes, just depends on how
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   it's going.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   >> What?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   >> We're going to be shooting some all out that week.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   For the month after Macworld, we're going to put up videos
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   through Macbreak of stuff we shot there.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   And then we're also going to be shooting in the studio where
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   we're going to be grabbing people and bringing them in to
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   highlight stuff that will come out over the next quarter.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   So it's just going to be a very, very heavy shoot week for us.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   I'm also speaking about doing film techniques or how to get a
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   little bit more of a film technique in iMovie on Wednesday
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   in the conference.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   And then also an all day seminar on podcasting on Friday.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   So I'll be definitely there in force.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   >> Scott, what are you doing?
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   >> Well, I hope that Alex and I are going to do the one year
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   anniversary show of TWIP because we've told everybody we are.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   >> Oh, good.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.160]   I want to come to that.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   >> So Alex, do you know when that'll be?
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   >> Yes.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   >> We don't think we're not doing it on the floor.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   We just have, we have, we have, we will have a little,
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   >> Will you go somewhere where people can watch like 21st
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   Amendment or somewhere like that?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.160]   >> We'll do something.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.160]   We'll do somewhere where people can watch.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   >> Oh, good.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   I want to watch that.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   I love TWIP.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.160]   >> Thank you.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   >> It's a one year anniversary.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   We did our first show there at Mac.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   >> That's hard to believe.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   >> With about 15 seconds of preparation, we grabbed Steve
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.160]   Simon and...
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.160]   >> Well, that's where I remember meeting you for the first time.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   Was it a Mac world about four years ago?
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   >> So, that's great.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   Speaking on the conference faculty, again, very lucky to get
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160]   that opportunity.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   On Wednesday from 2 to 2.45, I'll be doing a presentation in the
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   digital photography experience, which has to do with storing
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   and protecting your assets.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   On Wednesday from 6.30 to 7.30 pm, I'll be leading what they call
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   a bird's of a feather discussion on the convergence of still
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   photography and video.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   On Thursday, I do my big deal.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   This is actually a deal I'm doing for Apple.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   It's in the user's conference.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   You do have to buy a ticket to the user's conference to see this.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   It's a session.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   The session number is US 956, Aperture in Nature and Landscape
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   Photography.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   So, that's my thing.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   And Alex and I have talked about maybe doing a photo walk, so I don't
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   know.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   >> Wow.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   Photo walk around the Moscone Center.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   >> That should be -- you should get some great bums and --
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   >> Well, yeah, I think we might --
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   >> -- hard-board boxes.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   >> It might take a little better venue than just the Moscone
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   Center.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   >> That's not the most photogenic area of San Francisco.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   >> It could be.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   >> It could be.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   >> You know, if you're a good photographer, everything looks
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   good, doesn't it?
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   >> You can make something out of nothing.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   Anyway, I hope everybody comes out and says hi and, like, look
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   forward to seeing you.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   And of course, I look forward to doing the Mac Break Weekly and
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.160]   the Twip always.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   And I don't know if we're going to do that special podcast thing
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   we've done with Adam Christensen in the past, too.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   That might be another thing.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   >> I think Adam sent me a note that he's not going to do that
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   this year.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   >> Okay.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   >> I hope I'm not taking -- I'm not misrepresenting that, but I
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   believe Adam said he wasn't going to be able to do that this
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   year.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.160]   >> It was a lot of work for him.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.160]   >> It was great fun.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   >> Yeah, it was great fun.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   >> Let's see.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   What else -- oh, Mr. Anionnaco.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   Besides eating crab puffs, do you have any other plans?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   >> I'll be spending most of my time locked in the conference
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.160]   rooms in the hotel suites basically being briefed during walks
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.160]   between one meeting and briefing and another meeting and
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   a briefing.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   But I'm also going to -- Paul had some really cool ideas for this
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   year.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   One of them is to do sort of like a TED conference-like track in
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.160]   which it's not so much -- sessions that are not so much about
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   how to get the most out of your, you know, Blu-ray burner so much
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   as here are interesting things that are being done and
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   interesting perspectives.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   So I'm doing a session that is basically on how to -- basically
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   the first bit of it is giving you at least the first three
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.160]   semesters of a undergraduate electrical and electronic
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   engineering course.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   And then the rest of it is talking about how to use them
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.160]   to build actual hardware, actual gadgets,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   actual interface, actual things.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   So as we speak in my shop here, I've got -- I'm trying to
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   figure out what sort of things I can actually bring with me.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   I've got foot pedals that I've wired up that control iTunes
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   for me.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   No.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   So if I -- so if I've got -- it's not USB, it's just like a
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   mechanical, like an industrial, "Oh, for God, oh God, please God,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   stop this machine before it tears my arm off."
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   I got this foot pedal that I bought in my tea flea market that
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   I use for -- you know --
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   It's the emergency iTunes cutoff pedal.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   Exactly.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   Yeah, it also has -- and so that's like -- that is the -- oh,
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   my God, what's this obitrack doing in my iTunes library?
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   For that, you need a dead man switch.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   Exactly.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   Well, mostly after too long, it should just constrict this
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   collar on your neck and kill you.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   Because --
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   [Singing]
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   Waterloo.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   Waterloo.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   After you can do a lot of things, it can't make you
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   unremember having seen Mamma Mia.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   [Laughter]
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   So stuff like that.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   The problem with -- I also have a -- I have this really good
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   complicated project I did a couple of years ago that involved
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   basically getting the Mac to text message a coffee maker to
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   tell the snooze alarm on someone's alarm clock that it was
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   okay to wake my friend up because now the coffee is finally
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   ready.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   But as I -- you know, you get these great ideas and all of these
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   will really demo great, but then you realize that I will have
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   to actually carry all this junk with me 3,000 miles.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   So -- but it'll be interesting.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.160]   A lot of the stuff is just things you can just wire up
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   yourself.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.160]   Some of them -- some of them involves this really great little
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   $35 interface board called the Arduino that lets you just
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   design electronics and control electronics.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   And when I talk about design electronics, I don't mean
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   going to a clean lab in a bunny suit and, you know, interface
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   wafers into other elements.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   I'm talking about, gee, here's this little -- here's this little
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   thing that I can't really use for your own, already by -- if this is
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   controlled by a switch or if it uses an indicator light to report
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   to the -- something has happened, is there a way that it can be
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.160]   communicating with the Mac that way?
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   And it's actually very, very easy.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   So that's going to be a fun session.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   I'm doing a couple of things both in my publisher's booth at
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   Wiley and elsewhere promoting iPhone -- the second edition of
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   my iPhone fully loaded book.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   So there's going to be a lot of, like, iPhone stuff.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   And I did my trip to Maryland over the weekend.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   And I just gave a talk at Washington Apple Pie.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   And for the first time, I did a tweetup, where just on, like,
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   18 hours notice, I just said, well, gee, actually, I have no
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   plans for, like, late afternoon on Sunday.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   I said the sun Saturday night, just like my Twitter followers,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   you know, is anybody interested in getting together for a beer
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.160]   or something?
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.160]   And we had a great group of, like, 15 or 16 people.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   So I'm thinking about doing that sometime during Mac World
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160]   Expo.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   The only difficulty is that everybody's schedule is so heavy,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   and almost every, like, place you can meet is so packed out.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.160]   So that's something I would like to do, but let's see if I can
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.160]   actually make it happen.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   Well, it's going to be a great event.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   The gathering of the Mac tribe in San Francisco, Moscone Center.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   They don't do the East Coast one anymore, so this is it.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   This is the one.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.160]   You have to wonder, though, if the economy continues on the
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   current trend, will all trade shows start to go the way to
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   calm down?
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.160]   You know, I wonder that myself.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   What do you need a trade show for?
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   Really?
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   I mean, I think Mac World, no.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   We actually, I think had this conversation either last year
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   of the year before.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   Mac World is a little different from, say, CES or Comdex.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   Mac World is as much about the culture getting together and
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   meeting the people as it is dealers finding out about what
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   new products are.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   Yeah, I guess you're right, but I know a lot of trade shows are
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   in trouble.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   Oh, they're in desperate trouble.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   Yeah, I wonder.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   I agree with you.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   Well, especially now, you're going to have a lot of companies
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   are going to really rethink it next year.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   You know, next year is going to be the hard year to figure
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   it out.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   Yeah, Adobe basically said we heard that a lot of channels,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   resellers weren't showing up, so we don't need to have a booth
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   for them, which I think is a mistake because I think that
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   that's misunderstanding what Mac World is about.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   Unlike other trade shows, it's about speaking directly to your
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   users, which is not something we could say for CES or Comdex.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   Don't you wonder if it isn't got a little bit to do with it seems
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   like there's been a further chill in the Adobe Apple relationship
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   lately?
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   Oh.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   I mean, we still have the battle over getting flash onto the
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   iPhone.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.160]   The Lightroom Aperture War seemed to have heated up quite a bit.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   I don't know.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   I'm not hoping that that's happening.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   I think the two companies need to get along.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   I like them both, but I just wonder.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   I don't see how that would really be an effect because it's
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   always the decision to appear at Mac World turns into a smart
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   business decision.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.160]   You can't do it more than once just because, oh, wow, I'm a software
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   developer and I've always wanted to have a kiosk or a booth at
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.160]   Mac World.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.160]   You only do that once before you realize how much money cost
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.160]   you.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.160]   Mostly, especially for a company like Adobe, there's so many
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   little factors, including the fact that every person that you
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.160]   want to talk to in the press, all the starting at the guy who
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   books people do appear on the Today Show all the way down to
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   some guy with a small but very, very influential blog, you can
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   talk to 40 people in two days and really get your message out in
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.160]   one place.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.160]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   That's certainly why we're there.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.160]   That and the fact that it's next door.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   I'm traveling 3,000 miles with a plane change, baby.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   It's just down the street.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.160]   It helps a little bit too.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   Certainly with the budget, it helps a little bit.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.160]   Yes.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   Let's see.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   Other stories, some leaks now on 10, 5, 6.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   I think they're on their second or third build now that they
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   have sent to developers.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   The latest, the new build just came out and 100 plus fixes,
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   100 plus fixes, miscellaneous graphics, corruption issues,
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   problems with DVI and display detection, sluggish sinking
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   fixes, printing PDFs from mail of variety of mobile me sinking
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   problems.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   What are you laughing at?
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   I'm just saying, Microsoft, they just don't know how to
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   advertise.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   They should just hand that script to a voiceover and now it's
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   verbatim.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   The latest edition by Apple's own admission had the following
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   bugs and just reads them.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   Listen, the problems that you're--
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   Now who's laughing?
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   Well, I have to say, I haven't been bitten by any of these, so
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.160]   obviously kind of unusual situations, but it'll be good to
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   see that.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.160]   That should be out, they say, before the end of the year, 10.5,
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.160]   0.6.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   They really--
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   They ship these quite often, these point updates.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.160]   Does that make you more confident or less confident?
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   More.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   I want to see them.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   You know why?
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160]   Because of security issues.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.160]   There's no way every bit of software has security issues.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   If a company's not updating, that doesn't mean that their
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.160]   issues aren't there.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   It means they're not finding them and not fixing them.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   And the bad guys are.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   By the way, right after we talked about Apple telling people to
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   use an antivirus last week, they pulled that techno, that
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   knowledge base note.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.160]   And I can just--
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.160]   I think what happened is, OK, so somebody in Apple
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   marketing, you know, either reads the article in the Washington
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.160]   Post, Brian Krebs article, or hears us talk about it and goes,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   "What?"
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   And goes screaming down the hall saying, "Pull that out!
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   That's our effort!"
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   Classic battle between the Apple legal department and the
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   marketing department, and the marketing department won one.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   Well, I think-- here's my scenario.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   Is that the tech guys-- because this has been in there,
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   apparently.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   Nobody noticed it for 18 months.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.160]   And it was just poorly worded.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   I mean, really what they were saying is, if you're going to
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   use an antivirus, use a variety of antivirus.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   You know, don't all use the same one.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   Here's three we recommend.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   Marketing got a hold of it, pulled it down, and then legal got
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   a hold of it.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   And when they released, the spokesperson said, "Yes, we
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.160]   pulled it down, but you probably should have an antivirus
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   anyway."
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   So all three departments definitely waited on this one.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.160]   Well, you know, I got all these emails from Windows guys going,
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   "See!"
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   "You're going to have an antivirus?"
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   Yeah, I got them too.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   I got them too.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   And we talked about them when this week.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.160]   Well, so far I don't, and I don't-- still don't have any
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   virus protection on my Mac.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   Yeah, I'm not too worried about it.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.160]   I don't think any of us ran out.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   Do any of us run out and get an antivirus?
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   Oh, it's-- what I find so funny is that I'm-- is that I
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   find it to be so-- I'm not worried about it on the Mac, but
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   I'm terrified of it on the PC.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   It's like this crazy--
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   Right.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.160]   When I open up the PC side on my-- on my Mac, I will only go
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   to websites that I absolutely know.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   Well, you're right too.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   No, I'm just terrified of, you know.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   I just did a news bit this morning in San Francisco on KGO
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.160]   because AP set out a report that scams are up, that people are
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   receiving more emails saying, you know, want to work at home,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   click this link, and of course you go to a link, and either the
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   website itself just automatically infects you if you're on a
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   Windows machine, or says, hey, you need an update to your software
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   to see the video we're going to show you and infects you.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   Neither of these exploits affect Mac users.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   Mac users are still, you know, can-- can-- can read these scam
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.160]   emails with impunity, not that that's a good thing, but-- but they
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.160]   don't have to worry about it.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.160]   I keep trying to point out the people that it's unsafe to even
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   walk down the best by aisle where the Windows machines are.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   [laughter]
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   I'm not that bad yet, it might be.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   I wear a raincoat when I walk down that aisle.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   That is an area where I get so paranoid because I almost always
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   have at least a few Windows machines going, you know, that
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   I've got in for testing, in addition to the ones that I have
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:35.160]   for my own use, and I just remember-- like, just last month,
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.160]   I accidentally bought something on Amazon using a Windows machine,
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.160]   and I swear-- I'm not joking.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   For the next hour, I was like, oh, damn it, what did I just do?
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   Oh, damn it.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   I was checking my bank balances for, like, a month after--
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   Oh, no.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.160]   --because, well, I'm going-- it's protected and everything, but it's
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.160]   the difference between a machine that I implicitly trust that I don't
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.160]   even think of-- you use standard precautions, but I don't worry
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.160]   about online transactions on the Mac, but when I use a Windows
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.160]   machine, part of me is just saying, what is out there that the
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   antivirus software doesn't know about yet?
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   I just don't like doing-- I just don't like using any private
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   information through a Windows machine.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   Well, your antivirus won't--
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   I know it's paranoid.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   Your antivirus won't protect you if you, if you, you know, click
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   on these links.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   It might, after the fact, notice that you're infected, but by then
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   it's too late anyway.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.160]   So, no, it's scary to be a Windows user right now.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   It really is.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.160]   He's a-- it's a scary situation.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   I'd hate to be in that situation.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   Thank God we've made the right choice.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   A machine that never fails, never hangs, never crashes.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   Let's not go too far.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   Come on.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   It is a computer, after all.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   Santa Claus has been fired from his gig at the App Store.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   Santa Live, 2008, it was an iPhone application that provided a new
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   animated Santa Claus video to the kids every day.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   According to the unofficial Apple wed log, things started to go bad
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   for the developer.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   When it turned out he had been paying reviewers, he'd been using
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   This is clever to pay people to buy the app and then leave positive
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   reviews online when they eliminated the app.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   And now it's been pulled from the store because last Friday's
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.160]   episode of Santa Live, 2008, featured grandma got run over by a
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.160]   reindeer.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   Apparently some parents got irate because their little ones got upset
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   that Santa Claus would run over grandma.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   Such a great song though.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160]   That's like a classic.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.160]   Elmo and Patsy, man, that's he can't.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.160]   I just want to take this opportunity to point out that the
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   sling box player software for the iPhone is still not available
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   for the, has not been approved for the App Store.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   But the dancing Santa new video every day, the way the front
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   front for a scam, was in fact approved.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.160]   What's going on?
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   We want sling box.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   We want sling box.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   Oh, wait, wait.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   I forgot.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   We're all perfect.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   We're all wonderful Apple.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   Never does anything that was nasty or stupid or bad or.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.160]   No, I'm with you.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.160]   Or beyond.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.160]   I think the App Store is crazy.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.160]   It's crazy.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.160]   Boneheaded.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.160]   Well, you know, I do want to point out there's like 10,000 apps
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.160]   and all these downloads.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   And remember back when the developers were ruffling their
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.160]   feathers and say, Oh, nobody's going to write for that thing
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   because people are right.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.160]   And now, and and Trism isn't the only one making money, I'm sure.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.160]   What was it?
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   10,000 apps and they had what was it?
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   What were the sales numbers?
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   Some of us asked from 300 million App Store downloads and 10,000
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.160]   apps.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   You can have that counterculture attitude because it gets you
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.160]   lots of Twitter followers, but it doesn't pay any bills.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:48.160]   And, and I think it's been a very big success by any standard.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.160]   Now, could it be improved?
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   Absolutely.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.160]   But it sure has shown that just like they did with the iTunes
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.160]   Store, you know, they've got this thing figured out.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.160]   And this is what they do.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   I mean, it's, it's, I mean, I don't want to use the adjective
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.160]   diabolical because it has a negative connotation.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   But I don't mean it in that way, but it is diabolically good.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   Well, you are, you ought to read the article in, I cringley
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   wrote on what if Steve Jobs ran the big three auto companies?
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.160]   It, things would be very different.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   They, they would, they would be making hummers anymore.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.160]   That's for sure.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.160]   God, just, just think how smug and pretentious a Prius owner
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   was Apple going on it would be.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.160]   Oh my God.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   I was in, I was in the, what would happen is that they'd own
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   all the gas station.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.160]   That's right.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   That's the, that's the analogy, by the way.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.160]   Well, the funny thing is that I, I was in the Ginza Apple store
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   yesterday and which is the biggest Apple store I've ever seen.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   I mean, I, I literally walked out of the, out of the subway station
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   and looked and it was like, like the sun, let rays had come down.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.160]   There was like, it's like six or five or six stories high.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.160]   It was huge glass.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   You know, it's, it's the biggest Apple store I've ever seen and I had
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   to go in for no apparent reason.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.160]   And, and I went in and the, you go to the elevator because it's an
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   elevator to each floor.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   There's a theater on one whole floor and, but you hit the elevator
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.160]   and there's no, there's no floors.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.160]   The elevator's just go up and down.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   So you just get in and you get off where you want to get off.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   And I was like, that is so Apple.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   There's no floors.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   There's no floor numbers on you.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.160]   Oh, like the floor numbers, but there's no way to select them.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   You just, it's just, you know, it just goes, I want to go up.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   I want to go up and then you go up until you get to where you want
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.160]   and then you get off, but it's, you know, that minimalization.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.160]   Simple user interface.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.160]   Even elevators have them.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   So, uh, real quickly, let's run through the top 10 Apple stories of 2008
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.160]   according to information week magazine.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.160]   We'll just get your quick thoughts on these.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   Number one, Apple floats on air.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   The world's thinnest notebook.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   The MacBook Air announced in January.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   Um, still selling well.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.160]   I didn't, I'm sorry.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.160]   I was surprised.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   I did not think anybody would want to spend that much money for a
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   stripped down computer.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.160]   Boy, was I wrong.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   In fact, I was in the Apple store yesterday looking at it and
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   drooling and saying I want one, but I held off.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160]   That's already has.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   No, I don't have an air.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   My, I bought one for my bought my daughter in the, to go to France,
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   but I don't have one myself.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.160]   I'm still in the category of if, if it were cheaper, it would be
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   great.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.160]   If it were more powerful, it would be great, but really expensive,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.160]   really not very powerful, really not enough ports for me to really
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.160]   make a use out of it.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.160]   It looks great, but it doesn't look that great.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   Netbook.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.160]   We want a netbook and we want one in January.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   And that would be the logical, you know, successor.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   This is a tablet.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   That's all I want.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   Just a tablet.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   Apple.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.160]   I'm making air this even sharper so you can actually slice it.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   An actual cutting edge.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   Defense mechanism.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   Apple upgrades.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.160]   Story two.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.160]   Apple upgrades.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   Phone 3G.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   Big upgrade.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   I got to tell you battery life is so much better now with 2.2 that it,
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   that it just, it's the one thing that was really bugging me on the
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   phone and now I can't complain at all.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   Story three, 300 million downloads and counting on Apple's app
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   store.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   That was a story we just mentioned.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   Story.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.160]   How many?
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   300 million downloads.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   I contributed at least a million.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.160]   I know.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.160]   I know.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   Between us.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.160]   Easy.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.160]   But, but story five or a story four, Apple iPhone application
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.160]   developers grumble.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.160]   They're not happy.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.160]   That should be higher up.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   That should be above the, the air story.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   I don't know why the air, maybe, maybe number one doesn't mean it's the most
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.160]   important.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.160]   It's just the first one I thought of.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.160]   I think the person, I think he wrote it on an air.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.160]   That was just, oh wait, okay.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.160]   Easy.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.160]   Easy one.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.160]   This.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   What I'm looking at.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   New.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Attack of the Mac.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   Keep on Mac books or our, our, our flexible ease of do.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   Okay.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   That's number two for three.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   Coffee really tastes good next to an air.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   Number four.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   That's really how these lists get made up.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160]   That's the truth.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   You know, but it's an interesting, it is an interesting correlation
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   between the developers grumbling and 300 million downloads.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   Well, they're grumbling.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.160]   I understand the grumbles.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.160]   I mean, I'm, I'm with Andy.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   There's quite a few applications like the sling application that
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.160]   should be there yet, you know, especially when it comes to games,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.160]   there are just a ton of really good apps out there.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.160]   So it's not, look, nothing's, nothing's 100% one way or the other.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.160]   You don't have to give up your Apple membership card when you make a complaint
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.160]   about Apple.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.160]   It's kind of, it's okay.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   No, I, I, I, what I'm just, I guess what I'm getting at is that if you, if you look at,
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.160]   I don't, hey, grumble all you want, but what I, what I think was funny was the predictions
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   that nobody would ever write for that stupid apps, which has turned out to be the most
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.160]   I, you know, whoever was saying that wasn't, probably wasn't paying much attention.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   And they aren't paying many bills either.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.160]   I would bet you any developer that had said that at the time is probably rethinking their
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   strategy right about now.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Either that or they're saying, would you like fries with that?
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.160]   Apple, Apple, the attack of the clones is the fifth story and, and, and, and, or a sixth
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.160]   story.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.160]   And rightly so, SciStar are gone, but now there's another company, an Argentinian company,
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   offering really ugly Apple clones.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.160]   Are they just still fighting?
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.160]   Well, they're not selling.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   Okay.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   But there's, but that might not have been a whole, the whole point of putting those things
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160]   in the market from, from SciStar.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.160]   Right.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   And the challenge has not been a very accommodating to SciStar's case.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   So I don't know.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   Apple users struggle with mobile me.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   That's a big story.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   See, see that this is, this is why I really suspect this, this, this list has a lot of
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:52.160]   suspicion for me that really the number one story for this year is just the opening of the
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   app store for the iPhone.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   That was a total game changer for the song.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   I agree with you for everything.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.360]   I think that if we're going to come up with the loss of the number 10 most significant
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.160]   moments in Apple history, that would be even one step ahead of the iPhone.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.880]   Well, this is where he's scraping the bottom of the barrel now.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.480]   Apple spurns the enterprise.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.440]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.080]   I have, I have, I have how much time till deadline?
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Oh, damn it.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   Okay.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   Here's one.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.920]   Apple goes green.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.480]   Apple refreshes the, yeah, you know what?
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   Okay.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.480]   I'm throwing this out.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   I think we're done.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   We're done.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.440]   I thought it'd be such a good feature just to go through these one by one.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.040]   But no, in fact, it was a terrible idea.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.640]   Let's, let's say that for our big end of year episode.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.480]   We'll, we'll, we'll come up with the real list.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.480]   We'll do one.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.000]   We'll open source it and so that anybody, you know, in time news, we can claim that they
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.240]   wrote it at least less consistent across the board.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.960]   We gather together at next on the 30th and we will do our year ender and we'll tell you
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.600]   what really counted.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.840]   What really were the big stories in the Mac universe?
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.800]   I best, I best be going through the old shows and listening.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.000]   Best be finding, finding out what those stories were.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.400]   We always talk about the biggest stories here.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.200]   Today's big story.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   And you not go bottom new microphone for his camcorder.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   Baby.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   Oh, I like cross.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.200]   Big frosh.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   Big for me.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.080]   You get the TR six or you're waiting for the TR 10.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.680]   Well, I think as I look at the TR 10.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   I'm fine with it.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   I didn't have it.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   So I needed one that night.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.800]   So let's let's take a break.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.120]   Come back with our picks of the week.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:33.080]   We've got a, I'm sure some good software and hardware to recommend for you.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.280]   I did get an email from somebody saying, can you guys stop recommending such expensive
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   products?
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.680]   I'm broke.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.400]   So we're going to, I'm going to do a free one for you and then I'll do a free and a cheap
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.400]   about that.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.400]   I'll do.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.400]   I'll stick with the expensive.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:48.840]   How did I know it was you specifically?
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.600]   It was complaining about that Alex.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.440]   I'm mixing expensive.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.960]   But first, let's mention something that is a very affordable deal and a great, you know,
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   holiday gift ideas.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.720]   Well, and I'm talking of course about audible.com.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.920]   You go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.480]   You could get a credit toward a book, absolutely free book of your choice.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:16.800]   50,000 titles to choose from some of the best reading you'll and that's what I, you know,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   I call it reading.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.760]   I know people yell at me and say, you're listening.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   No, no.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   But with the same words that just entering my brain through my ears instead of my eyes
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:29.600]   and I have to say it in many ways, I think it's a much more satisfying reading experience
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   to listen to a book to have it read to you.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.480]   I'm listening to a Nancy Boyz, a Neil Gaiman novel.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   Normally Neil reads him.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:43.560]   This one is being read by another really talented actor who has the, and I think this
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.200]   is why Neil decided not to read it.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:52.280]   The Nancy Boyz are Caribbean and he has the accent down and it's really good.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.480]   He's really, really good.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:59.440]   The Nancy Boyz is one of my favorite Neil Gaiman books and this is an incredible rendition
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   of it.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.880]   And it just shows you where the performance is so much a big part of this.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:11.160]   You know, it's a collaboration between the author who wrote the book, but then the, the
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:17.080]   gal guy who reads it, this is Lenny Henry does such a good job of the Nancy Boyz.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.080]   What are you reading these days?
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.160]   And are you going to think for us?
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.400]   Not really because I'm still getting, I'm still finishing up the Serena live book.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.480]   How do you like that?
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.160]   That Tom Schill's book.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.160]   Very, very, very great.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.160]   Isn't it great?
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.800]   Because they get to see now that this is the book is really wonderful because every,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:40.160]   it has the best parts of both an unauthorized and unauthorized book because everybody who
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.400]   has, it has so many different cast members who has so many different experiences.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.560]   And they were very, very free to say, well, look, it was very, really, really bad for
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:52.720]   me because you just, you know, there were, there were people who felt as though you,
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.880]   they didn't have that there wasn't the kind of ethnic diversity in the class.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:01.080]   And if you, in the, in the cast, and if you were, you know, if, if Chris Rock could not
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.880]   had trouble getting sketches on, there is definitely an institutional problem there.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.560]   And again, to a nice discussion there, you have people like Janine Garafolo who are
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.960]   interviewed for it and told, talked about how just what a shattering experience she
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.280]   thought it was that you wanted to get out of her contract in one month's time.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:21.720]   The only, and it goes to the history makes you respect and disrespect the show even more
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.440]   than you did before.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.240]   But the only problems are that sometimes, now sometimes I'm saying sometimes, some of
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:33.680]   these voices are miscast because they, most of the time they won't find like when they,
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.640]   when it's Chevy Chase or Dana Carvey talking, you know, they won't find a sound alike to
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.280]   read it, but they'll find a voice that's very, very compatible.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.600]   But then like they'll be, you know, you're interviewing Paul Schafer and it'll say, well,
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.640]   I wanted to quit the show because I wanted to work with Gilda Ratner.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.000]   That's only because you really know how Paul Schafer sounds.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.680]   He talks like this and I thought it was a swing in time I was having with Paul Schafer.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.400]   Every time I'm like, wait a minute, who's that talking again?
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.520]   But yeah, I have seen, believe it or not, I mean, I actually right now I just realized
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.840]   that I do have my one monthly credit as a subscriber.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:18.320]   And I'm just about to probably buy, he spent it on Steve Martin's autobiography that I've
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.880]   read but not listened to.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.960]   And he reads it himself and it's really, really good.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:28.880]   Born standing up, which is really, I loved the book because I loved my favorite comedians
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:34.200]   are the ones where they're funny and great and dynamic on stage, but off stage when
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.880]   you're when you ask them about their job, they find that they're very serious about
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.880]   their job.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.920]   They're not boring, but they said, look, here's what here's how I came up with this.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.400]   And this, this what worked and what didn't work.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.880]   And it made me again, and filming this so introspect for Steve Martin because every, the
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.240]   book is not not his life story.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.720]   It's about the act that made him a superstar in the mid 70s and how it took him 10 years
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.440]   to develop it thought by thought, step by step, innovation by innovation.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.000]   And so I think even though it's, I often do this, even though I read the book, it's a
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.520]   book that I read like last year and enjoyed, but now I want to hear Steve Martin reading
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.520]   the book.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.520]   It's so good.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.520]   It's so good.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   And you want to hear it.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.920]   I mean, it's a memoir and you want to hear him read it in his own voice and he does and
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   it's so good.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   Well, there's three recommendations.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   Let's see.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.360]   Alex Lindsey, you got a book you want to recommend?
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.920]   I am going through.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.880]   I'm just starting Malcolm Gladwell's new book.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.360]   Oh, I know outliers.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.520]   Yes.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:33.560]   And I think that it's, you know, it's, it's a, I find that he's really good at writing,
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.760]   writing stuff about obvious stuff.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.960]   Like, you know, it's, you're like, oh, yeah, but it's not obvious to you read it.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   And then you go, Oh, yeah.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   Some of it's not obvious at all.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.120]   I mean, the way to keep reading, there's some stuff in there you'll go.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   Whoa.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.440]   So I'm, I, you know, because the, the, the, we used to always, I mean, we used to save
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.440]   it a long time.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.880]   10,000 mistakes was the difference between a thinner and something of a mastered something
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.080]   and the 10,000 hours kind of fit into that.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.080]   It's actually right.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.920]   And, and you really see, you know, that that's about how long it takes.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:06.240]   And, but it's, I find it to be, I find his stuff worth listening to.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.240]   And he reads it.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.240]   He's got that great voice.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.840]   He reads it really well.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.280]   And Scott, you're still listening to the Spartans.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.920]   Actually, I've been trying to, I heard the rumor that you could get Playboy on there and
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   I'm still trying to figure that out.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.360]   Penhouses on there.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   There is.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.840]   There is a whole series, the whole section of erotica, but we'll leave that to you.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.840]   Scott, you can give us.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:28.840]   I can't go to the reader.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.680]   Actually, I, I, James Earl Jones.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.680]   Yes.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   Dude, but host.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:40.680]   I always, I always joke about this, but all those times of Alex saying, you know, Spartan,
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:47.520]   Spartan, Spartans, I actually got it because I had, I had, I had a 18 day trip to drive
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.520]   in my truck.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:52.360]   So my, my seat, my, my, my power of suggestion was success.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.320]   So I had to say, I really did.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.880]   I just finished it.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.560]   And here's the great, the great thing about it.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.840]   I finished it about 10 minutes before pulling in to gig harbor.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.240]   And don't you feel more cultured now?
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:10.560]   No, but I, I really do feel like I don't want awful lot about the Spartans.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.960]   I thought it was very, I thought it was a fascinating book.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   Well, there you go.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:18.440]   I don't know how many people would be really shocked to find out how those folks live their
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   lives.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   Very smart.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:29.400]   I mean, I mean, I mean, in today's, you know, traditional American values that they wouldn't
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.760]   be looked very happily upon.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.960]   So it's, it's a very, a very interesting book, definitely worth listening to to.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.120]   Well, there's, I've lost track of how many recommendations, but you get the essence,
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.960]   the wide variety from pink.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.720]   I got their money to work on the show.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.360]   They did audible.com/mac, right?
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360]   Give it a try.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   You're going to love it.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   Get your book right now.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.160]   It's a very audible.com/macbreak.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.880]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.080]   Time for your picks.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.640]   Let's, who's got the most expensive pick of the week this week?
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.640]   Let's get that out of the way.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.400]   Is that you, Alex or you Skye?
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.960]   I, I, mine's only a hundred fifty nine, but mine's more.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.240]   How much is yours, Andy?
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.480]   Mine is thirty dollars.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.120]   Mine's fifty and zero.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120]   So you start out.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   Oh, I have both ends.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.320]   I have the cheapest and the most expensive in a single recommendation.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.960]   It's the man with two ends.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   Go ahead.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   All right.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.560]   So my recommendation is Google SketchUp and Google SketchUp Pro.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.880]   That is both ends, isn't it?
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.680]   So Google SketchUp is nothing.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.200]   Google SketchUp Pro is four ninety five.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.280]   And it is just such a great application and it's such a great business model.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.120]   You know, the thing is, is that I think that Google has really done it right with this
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.400]   application.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.680]   So what Google SketchUp is really designed, it was designed originally.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.520]   It was a company called Atlast that Google bought for architects.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.960]   So to build models, but you can build a lot more than just buildings.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.720]   You can, you can, it's not the same as something like Moto or, or Cinema 4D, which I've talked
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.200]   about in the past, but it's a very, it's very intuitive.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.880]   You can throw stuff together really fast.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.680]   Even if you know, you can want, I have some great.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.680]   I work at Google.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   You can follow those.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.480]   And I have the DVD storage problem.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   Build three models.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   You want to model your house.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480]   SketchUp is free.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   You can do a lot of stuff.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.440]   So when we're building digital sets, I'm thinking about, you know, someday I want to build
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.440]   a house.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   And so, you know, I've been slowly like laying stuff out.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.440]   If you want to lay things out and figure out where you're going to put things, you know,
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.600]   those simple things, you can, the Google SketchUp, the base version, the free version will import
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.240]   and export in and out of the 3D warehouse, which is part of what they've set up.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.440]   And you can get stuff, you can literally pull stuff from Google Earth.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:41.040]   So if you want to build like you can find your house on a satellite and you can, you
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.520]   can, you can, you're in Google SketchUp with Google Earth open and you can click on it
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.800]   and it'll actually pull that in, orient it in the right direction so that you can model
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.640]   your house and then you can send it back to Google Earth if you want to or any building
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.440]   or any location.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.240]   So that integration is really, really interesting.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.160]   And if you just want to start playing with 3D and you want to use 3D for a couple things,
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.000]   you know, Google SketchUp, the base version is free, is has just about everything a person
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.440]   starting would need.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.240]   So there's nothing, you know, the pro version lets you send 3D models to other programs
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.320]   like Cinema 4D or Moto or Exocire, whatever you want to use.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.040]   It also has a layout program.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.160]   So if you want to do presentations, it has what's called dynamic components, which lets
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.680]   you, you know, for instance, if you had some stairs, you can tell it at stairs and when
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.040]   you make it shorter, it actually just gets rid of the stairs that you need rather than
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.240]   stretching them out.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:39.760]   And it has some style builder, which lets you, you know, create some more custom looks
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.320]   for your renderings.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.560]   But outside of that, that stuff that someone just getting into this who wants to play with
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.600]   3D, wants to play with modeling, you don't really need that.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.080]   So if you're really getting into it and you're really getting serious or you're an architect
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.040]   or whatever, you might need the pro versions.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:04:02.400]   But you really have a very, very full featured program in a free, you know, as a free program.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.240]   It's just a fantastic piece of software that I think just everybody should try.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.240]   It's really, really great.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.680]   It's really fun to download the models to the people who have done.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.680]   It's just incredible.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.680]   You know, we do shoots.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.560]   You know, there's a whole film model set up.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.920]   So there's like sea stands and cameras and lights and they're very, you know, they're
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.320]   very well built and very simply.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.320]   And so you can sit there and go, well, this is how we want to set up the shoot and we
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.560]   can throw these sea stands in and move the camera around and we can, I use it for even
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.520]   just illustrating how certain, how we're going to, like if I'm talking in a class and
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.640]   I want to talk about how we set up a green screen or how we set, you know, I have Google
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.800]   Sketchup versions of that that I can kind of build and show, show where all the pieces
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   are.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.080]   And there's time, I mean, hundreds of thousands of components, whether it's, and you know,
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.880]   the film areas, one thing or buildings or all kinds of other components that you can
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.880]   get for free.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.800]   So you don't even need to know how to model and you can start laying stuff out.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   It's really awesome.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.200]   Google Sketchup, both free or 500 bucks you pick.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.560]   And if you, who should get the full 700, whatever.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.120]   If you need to integrate with other 3D programs, so if you're a professional 3D person that
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.240]   needs to move stuff in and out of other 3D programs, if you're an architect, if you're
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.240]   really planning to do.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.200]   If you're going to use it professionally, in other words.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:27.400]   When you use it professionally, you'll want the extra pieces.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.560]   But I think that 90% of our listeners would probably be happy with the freefurs.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   So that's good to know.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.600]   Let's see, I guess I'm next because I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   I have the.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   159.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.680]   I got your next got your next 159s next.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.640]   Which is lower than my usual suggestions.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.880]   I want to mention.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.200]   Absolutely it is.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.680]   You bet my suggestion is a product called Genuine Fractals 6.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.040]   Genuine Genuine Fractals 6.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.520]   And this is the most recent version.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.840]   They just came out with it.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.800]   And for those of you that are familiar with interpolation, this is a way to make your
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.760]   photographs print larger than they have a right to because they use special algorithms
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.240]   that rez up the photograph better than you can do natively in something like aperture,
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.200]   eye photo or Photoshop.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.720]   And they use a certified magic to do that.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.240]   I have absolutely no idea how it works.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   Yeah, because when you, not only when you launch something, you just get more pixelated.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   Exactly.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.800]   When you use Genuine Fractals, it doesn't.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.480]   And I've been using the program since its first version.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.360]   It has definitely gotten better over the years at first.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.160]   It worked kind of well.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.800]   But now it really works well.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.560]   And the cool thing is, is that in Genuine Fractal 6, they've got a couple of new features.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.680]   One that I really like is a tiling feature.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.320]   So it can print, you know, you can print really big prints by tiling them together.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.120]   And they also finally got batch processing, which was always the bane of the program,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.120]   frankly, for me.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.120]   But now they've got that.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.880]   So you got a bunch of pictures at once.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   So that you can do, do it.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:07.320]   Now it does change your file format to this new file format called STN, Sam, Tom, Never,
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.960]   STN.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.520]   But hey, it's not a big deal.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.520]   You just open it back up in Genuine Fractals and you can always resize it.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:22.520]   For those that need to make really big prints from small cameras, you know, this is something
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   worth a try.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.440]   It's $159 for the full standalone version.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.600]   And by the way, this new version also has been upgraded to work with the latest versions
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.920]   of Photoshop, Aputure, and Lightroom.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:38.000]   And you can do the upgrade for 99 bucks and they have a free demo.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.160]   What more do you get for the $300 Professional Edition, is it?
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   $159.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.360]   That's the standard edition.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.880]   For $300 you get the Professional Edition.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.360]   Ah, I have not tested that.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   You just use a standard.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   All right.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   Well, you're a pro and you're using standards, so I think it's good.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   Yeah, I just use this and I'm very happy with the results.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   Cool.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:05.000]   I took some pictures that I actually made with my G9 and printed them 20 inches by 30 inches
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   and we talked at the results.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   Very good.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Genuine Fractal 6.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.480]   And it's available from a company called OnOneSoftware.com.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.720]   They're out of Portland.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   On One.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.840]   I have a free recommendation which is really more of a note if you've ever used LaunchBar.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.760]   We're pretty much, I think, all, I shouldn't say that.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   I know Andy did.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   I'm a quick silver user.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   I'm gonna say me.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.080]   Actually, a surprisingly large number of you don't use quick silver, but I love it and
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.920]   I wouldn't dare use a Mac without it.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.800]   Before there was quick silver, there was a program called LaunchBar.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.480]   They're getting ready for LaunchBar 5 and right now they're offering free use of LaunchBar,
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.080]   the beta release of LaunchBar 5, which is certainly worth checking out.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.360]   Both quick silver and LaunchBar do essentially the same thing, which is a key simple, key
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   stroke launching of applications, programs.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.520]   LaunchBar has a lot of neat things like you could have aggregate the clipboard, multiple
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.680]   clipboard, things like that.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.760]   Some very nice features.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.280]   There are people who are LaunchBar people.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.560]   There are people who are quick silver people, but if you have never used LaunchBar, you have
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.560]   to use it absolutely free.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.440]   I think it's from objective development.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.280]   I think it's actually well worth a try.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.040]   I think they do a very nice, it's a very nice program.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.800]   New icon to LaunchBar from objective development.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.840]   That's free to try.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   Here's one that's 50 bucks.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.160]   We've talked to the past about bundles.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.160]   Mac update.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.280]   I use Mac update a lot as a website to check out the latest versions of things.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.920]   They are, I don't know if this is their first bundle.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:51.040]   I think it might be their second, but they've got a new holiday bundle that is pretty impressive.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:58.560]   It's about 500 bucks worth of software for $50, including programs I really love and recommend.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.520]   Now, if you're taking Apple's admonition to get an antivirus seriously, you can get virus
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:09.760]   barrier as part of this, but you also get little snitch, which I think is a very useful
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.320]   securities program that watches outbound traffic for you.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.640]   I think that might even be more useful in this day and age of spyware.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.160]   The two of those together, that's the ultimate in protection, but it includes some other things.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.840]   Mac Gourmet Deluxe, which is from Mariner Software.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840]   It's a recipe program.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.160]   Default folder X, which I really like from St. Clair software, which kind of modifies how
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.480]   the folders work, and it gives you a default folder for each application, which is kind
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   of handy.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.400]   Drive Genius, which is a drive optimizing and repairing program.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.160]   Rapid Weaver, which many people from RealMac love for web development.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.040]   Some really cute little utilities you might find useful, including KeyQ, which gives you
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.440]   full keyboard shortcuts for all your applications, so you can print those out.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.560]   Mac Pilot, which lets you turn on a lot of user interface features that aren't normally
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.360]   exposed, what size and eye volume.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:10.000]   All of those, it's about 470 bucks worth of software for 49 bucks.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.800]   All of these programs are useful, good programs, and I think that's a really good deal.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:19.520]   A great way to get full licenses to all of those programs from Mac Update.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.600]   We talked with Philip Ryu about his bundles a couple of months ago.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.760]   These bundles are apparently very popular with Mac users.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.120]   There's so much good shareware out there.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.600]   That's probably why.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.600]   So a couple of recommendations for you.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.240]   Finally, Mr. Andy Inatko.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:42.280]   When Apple came up with all their new iPhones and I paused this year, they kept the dock
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.000]   connector the same, but they made one hellaciously bad change to it.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.400]   Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.080]   Your old docks and your old cables and such, Koo, could no longer charge your new devices.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.360]   Now that wasn't a bad deal for me so much because Chiefy, Chiefy, I just got two things.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.480]   I have my car adapter and you know what?
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.040]   I needed a new car adapter anyway, so just put away the old one, bought a new one, 20
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   bucks.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.200]   Again, I'm not rich, but I can afford $23, especially one with extra USB ports for charging.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.200]   Good, good, good, no problem.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.600]   But the problem is that I also at one point spent more than 100 bucks when I needed a
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.840]   boom box or radio for the kitchen, for the office or whatever, instead of buying a
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.000]   boom box, I bought a nice, like, set iPod speakers for the integrated dock and now that
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.720]   doesn't work or rather it works, but at the expense of being two hours poorer in battery
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.200]   life when I take my phone out of the dock.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.320]   Well, a company called Skosh came up with these two, the first kind of this really cool,
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.800]   just simple little device, they call it the Passport, it costs 30 bucks.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.760]   It's just this little thing, my Bob, you plug into the bottom of, you plug into the end
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.240]   of either your dock or your existing charger and it will just simply do whatever has to
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.520]   be done to make sure that the power pass through happens.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.000]   So as far as you know, you just have this little poster stamp black thing at the end
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.200]   of the cable and now everything works just great the way it was supposed to the way before.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.920]   And like I said, I already got the new car adapter, so I don't really care about it.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.040]   I actually wound up putting it inside my iPod high-fi, which is, again, my kitchen radio,
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040]   which is...
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.040]   You actually bought that.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.840]   Well, because I was a loner from Apple and it turned out that I liked it enough that
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.840]   it was sort of, it was really what I wanted, meaning all the other ones that were on the
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.920]   market, they didn't sound better, they weren't, they were in the same ballpark in terms of
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.960]   money and if they had extra features, they were just extra complications.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.600]   And again, this was something that was already inside my house.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   Right.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.800]   I wonder, now they still sell it, right?
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.640]   I believe it's off the price list.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640]   Oh, interesting.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.520]   It's one of those things that quietly died to deathly death of death.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.120]   Deathly death, yes.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.400]   Which is a shame because Steve Jobs threw out all of his homes.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.960]   I know, he must really feel less.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.360]   I guess that's why he can't get them because he bought all the ones that are already there
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.760]   so he could have one in every of his houses.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.360]   But that's not unique to the iPod.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.440]   Again, they're bows, make some nice dogs.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.240]   All the JBL, all these companies make nice little dogs that...
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.640]   But suddenly they don't work.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.600]   Well, again, they'll pass through the audio but that means that now you plug in your iPod
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.600]   and you realize that after, if you put in the Barry White, if you don't close the deal
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.200]   within 90 minutes with your date, you're going to have to just pop into the charger
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200]   in more ways than one.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.400]   So you're saying this is Viagra for your iPod?
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   So to speak.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.280]   Yeah, but now they've...
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:47.480]   Skosh, that's one of those weird names, S-C-O-S-C-H-E, and if you dot com that, you'll get to
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   their site.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:54.040]   Now, the problem with using it in a system like the iPod High Fire and other dock is
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.920]   that it wasn't really designed for that.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.120]   I wound up having to bend a little piece of loose sight so that my iPod would have some
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.840]   support so it wouldn't just be sort of like wavering back and forth on a little spring
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.760]   just supported by that little metal inserts inside the dock connector.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.520]   Well, they've heard the police that I never made but probably should have.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520]   And next month...
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.080]   You heard your imaginary, please.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   Exactly.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   Or they...
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.880]   Maybe I'm like Aquaman for technology.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.880]   I just...
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.880]   You think?
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.520]   So they come up with a new version of the passport that works with docking stations.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:34.200]   People did come out with a while ago just to standardize sort of socket that an iPod
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.640]   or an iPhone could sit in.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:43.480]   And when you buy a new device, a new iPod Nano, a full-sized iPod, a little plastic insert
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.760]   that works inside the standard dock system.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:52.840]   So they've come out with the exact same sort of device only built inside of a dock compatible
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840]   little well.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:59.240]   So all that happens is that you snap this inside of whatever speaker set you have that's designed
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.560]   to accept standard iPod iPhone docks.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.400]   And now it just simply works for now on.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.160]   So that's just 10 bucks more.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.360]   The original passport is 29 bucks.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.000]   The passport for the docking station is 10 bucks more and it's going to start shipping
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   next month.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.600]   I just noticed it on the website a little while ago and I thought, "Oh, I'm so totally
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.760]   buying this."
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.240]   Because 40 bucks is 40 bucks.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.120]   But again, if you're happy with the dock, the speaker set you already have and you don't
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.720]   want to spend another 100 bucks and another 150 bucks, again, 40 bucks and finally you're
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.440]   back to where you were before Apple improved things for you.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:39.000]   So this will go into any iPod universal dock and it includes a dock adapter for Bose units,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   which is great.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   Right.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.800]   Very cool.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:49.640]   So if you have something like the Apple Hi-Fi that docks but doesn't charge the passport
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:56.080]   for home docking stations in black or white, a very good pick.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.120]   Well that pretty much wraps us up for this week's Mac break weekly.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.360]   I want to thank you for being here.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:08.480]   Andy Inako is at the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth, C-W-O-B dot com and also the Chicago Sun times.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   And always welcome.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:15.760]   He'll also be going with us on our Mac Mania Cruise this summer to China.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.880]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.680]   I just heard from a NASA astronomer friend of mine who was on the fence.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.680]   But now that she knows that that's happening around the same time as an eclipse in China.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.080]   Yeah, in fact there is an after, I think there's a land tour after the cruise to go see the
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.080]   eclipse.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.880]   Yeah, I'm thinking about extending my trip just for that because of the eclipse.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.400]   You know, when do I have an excuse to stare at the sun and like not be called a fool for
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   it?
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.480]   Oh, that'd be fun.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.600]   I know I agree with you that astronomers do that all the time.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600]   They make special trips.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.720]   It's like considered such a big deal.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.600]   They really want to see it.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   That's going to be fun.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.960]   You can find out more about that at insightcruises.com.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.640]   We're leaving July, well I'm leaving July 3 because I'm doing the land portion, the one
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.120]   week tour of China ahead of time.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.600]   And then we're going to cruise from China to Korea to Japan.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.880]   It's going to be great with all sorts of Mac information lectures.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:11.760]   I'm going to talk about doing a home theater set up with a Mac mini as well as of course
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.920]   60 great iPhone apps in 60 minutes.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.400]   That'll be fun.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   Mac cruises.com.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.920]   Mr. Scott Bourne, our hero.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.560]   I'm the hero today.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560]   I'm here our hero.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560]   Well, you're here.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560]   And that means you're here.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.800]   Scott, you are in many ways my hero and also you are my photographic hero every time I
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.440]   see your every time I see your pictures.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.400]   I'm like, oh, I only thought I was really good.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.200]   I hate how humbling good photographers really are.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   Exactly.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   That's very good.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   Hey Scott, where can people see that photo that you shot of the birds?
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   Oh.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.600]   If you go to twpphoto.com to Tuesday today when we're recording this show, it's the
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.080]   top post to twpphoto.com.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.680]   I wrote my sort of recap story and then there's a link to cranes in the fire mist or you could
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.760]   just probably Google cranes in the fire mist, which is turning out to be one of my most
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.760]   successful prints.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   This is gorgeous.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.080]   I got back and there are 67 out of the hundred prints already sold.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.760]   Oh, so you're selling these as prints.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   That's great.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   Canvas.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.680]   Oh, I love that.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.200]   He's actually painting them himself.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.600]   No, no.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:27.400]   Actually I work with a local lady that does canvas sizing of art prints for painters and
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.920]   she takes my photographs and puts them on there and then she does all kinds of mojo
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.480]   magic to protect them and stretches them on real.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   Wow.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.120]   Just like she play probably or something like that.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.720]   I don't know.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:45.120]   Anyway, it's 16 by 24 canvas stretched with top of the line presentation and I'm really
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.440]   gratified to see that people like the picture because it took me 12 years to make it.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   Why 12 years?
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.600]   I kept going back because I had to have like nine things happen that I wanted to have
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.600]   happened.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.600]   Oh, you knew that show.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.640]   See, that's one of the things that makes a great photographer is that kind of patience
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.680]   and determination.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.360]   You knew that at some point you'd get a silhouette.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:09.840]   Well, insanity is another potential thing.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.400]   It just worked out really well.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.920]   Fourteen years ago my friend Arthur Morris, who's one of my mentors, one of the top bird
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.720]   photographers in the world, took this picture that motivated me.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:24.440]   I had my own vision in mind and so I went back 12 years in a row trying to recreate what
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.080]   he did.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.120]   The incredible things that have to happen for this to work, the wind has to be from
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   a certain direction.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.720]   The temperature has to be a certain temperature.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.080]   The sun has to be coming from the right way and it has to be no clouds and blah, blah,
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.080]   blah.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.760]   All this stuff actually happened and I found myself standing there going, "Wow, it's really
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.160]   going to happen."
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:50.440]   And then my palms got sweaty because I realized, "Okay, this is the moment."
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.400]   It was just like in nine seconds it was over.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.400]   You're kidding.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   It was great.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.640]   I got it and the shot turned out even better than I pre-visualized.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   So it was a great trip.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.080]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.760]   I got to lead a couple of workshops.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.120]   Anyway, if you want to see those pictures, twitphoto.com, we got a link.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   Thank you.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   Very cool.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120]   Very cool.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.480]   Twitphoto is also the place to go, of course, for that great podcast.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   Oh, look at this.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:17.120]   Oh, that's the one you're talking about.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.120]   Oh, wow.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.120]   Wow.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120]   I'm looking at it.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120]   Crane's in the Fire Mist.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.120]   Holy cow.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.280]   I had the wrong one up on the screen.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   That's amazing.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   Thank you.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   That was so...
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.280]   Wow.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.120]   You had nine seconds to get.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:33.440]   That's where all the years of preparation makes all the difference, doesn't it?
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.920]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.400]   When I drove into the reserve that morning, the refuge, I mean, and I saw that conditions
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.240]   might be right, I had my camera all ready to go.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.360]   And basically, all that needed to happen was the birds flying into the right side of
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.640]   the frame, which is the improbable thing that really I wanted to happen, that I didn't
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   count on.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:57.800]   I was going to do the shot without them, but then I saw them coming and I just said, "Okay,
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   here we go.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.040]   Nine frame burst, the buffer filled, the birds landed, the rest of them took off, the sun
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.040]   was over."
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.040]   And it was over.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   Wow.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.040]   Okay.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.040]   Either guy or I don't.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.040]   Wow.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.800]   Oh, that is a stunning shot.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   Thank you.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.800]   When you see a photo like that, there's the Seneca quote that luck is what happens when
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.360]   preparation meets opportunity.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   That's a perfect example.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.040]   But even the way that Crane's heads are and everything, it's just amazing.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040]   Unbelievable.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.040]   It was a great time.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.040]   It was great to be there.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.680]   It happened so fast.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:34.840]   And then somebody actually sent me a very poignant email saying, "Congratulations, and
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.320]   I grieve for you because now you've had this thing you've carried for 12 years you've
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.400]   wanted to do, you've accomplished what's next, and I realized, yeah, I've got to think
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.680]   up something to top it and I don't know what I could do."
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680]   Wow.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   Amazing.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.720]   Did you look in your viewfinder and know that you had it or did you have to get home
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.560]   before you knew you had it?
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.000]   Well, here's the really sad news.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.720]   I was teaching a workshop, so I immediately pulled the card out and put in my little card
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.800]   safe and stuck it in the closest pocket to my chest.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.720]   And then I went through the agonizing rest of the morning teaching the workshop.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.280]   Just wanting to run home and look at the picture in the hotel.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.720]   But being the dutiful instructor that I am, I carried out my duties and then as soon as
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:24.000]   it was lunch break, you have never seen a fat man run so fast in your life.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.080]   They were thinking about giving me the Heisman Trophy.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.520]   I was back at that hotel.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   It's a 20 minute drive.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:33.520]   I was there in three and a half minutes and I put that thing on the computer and I fired
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.280]   it up full screen and there it was.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.520]   And I got to tell you, it was for me, you know, I rarely like my own pictures, but I
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520]   like that one.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.160]   That's a D3.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:48.720]   That's a D3 with the Sigma 3 to 800 F5, 6 lens all the way extended to 800 millimeters.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.720]   Oh, no.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.840]   On a very heavy, get so tripod with a very heavy, heavy, wimberly gimbal head to study
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840]   it all.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.400]   So that was on a tripod.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.800]   So you really, I mean, wow.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.400]   Yeah, you weren't panning that along with those birds.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.880]   You had to get that shot.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.040]   It kind of was, Leo.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.920]   It's called a gimbal head and it looks like a machine gun turret.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.920]   So you could a little bit move it.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.840]   It does allow you to move side to side quite a bit.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:19.480]   But, you know, it is one of those things where a lot of stuff had to line up and, you
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.040]   know, I just, I got lucky.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.040]   What can I say?
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.040]   I got lucky.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.760]   And did you make any modifications and apertures?
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.040]   That pretty much how it came out?
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.040]   Well, I just, you know, I just adjusted the color a little bit and, you know, did some
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.360]   sharpening and cropping and that's it.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   Wow.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   It's just, I encourage everybody to go to TookPhoto.com and take a look at that.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.360]   It's what is it called?
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   Craynes in the Fire Mist.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.160]   Craynes in the Fire Mist.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   You go ahead.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.960]   You'll find it.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:52.520]   It was a lot of fun and, you know, what was really great for me was I had a lot of students
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.800]   with me and they didn't quite get that shot, but they got some shots that are close enough
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.440]   that they're going to go home and all their friends are going to think they're super wildlife
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   photography.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.000]   Which is what you want to have happen on a way?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   Sure.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   Sure.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   They'll feel really good about it.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   They're going to go home and tell their friends, "Hey, look at these shots."
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   Wow.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.920]   Let us, oh, wait a minute, before we go, TookPhoto.com and your co-host, Mr. Alex Lindsey, also there.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.080]   And at Pixelcore.com at Pixelcore.tv.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.800]   And now he's in Japan working on a movie.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   Yep.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   So we're working.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:26.800]   Memoirs of a teenage amnesiac.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.800]   How's it going?
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800]   It's going pretty well.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   You know, it's some days, some days it's going really well.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.280]   Other days is like Project Greenlight.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.600]   You know, it's a small budget.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.080]   It's a small budget film, you know, and so it has all the stress that when you're, you
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.640]   know, you have a limited, you know, supply of resources, it's not, you know, a lot of
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.960]   movies, the first movies that I worked on were all, you know, had budgets of over $80
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:52.960]   million.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.240]   And so I find it fascinating to be on a smaller film.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.360]   And but the crew is just, I mean, both the American crew, the director, Visual Tech Supervisor
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.240]   DP, so on and so forth are really great.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.400]   And there's no, none of the typical Hollywood ego stuff going on.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.520]   It's just everyone's just trying to get the best thing they can get out.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.080]   And the Japanese crew is the fastest crew I've ever, I've ever seen.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.480]   I mean, it's just, it's insane.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.200]   But we've had some relaxing days.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.000]   We had last week, I think we had a 22 hour, 22 hour shoot day, which was.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   Wow.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.800]   And we made snow.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.720]   We made, we, we, we shipped in six tons of.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.960]   Six tons of salt to reproduce snow across a bunch of steps.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.920]   And it actually looked pretty good.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.760]   Amazing, even in a low budget film, how much work and stuff you guys do.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   I mean, it's yeah.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:47.240]   But we'll definitely have more to show next year.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.680]   So I'm going to be right now.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.680]   We can't show anything.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.640]   But once the movie comes out, we'll be putting stuff in a lot of the pixel core shows and
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.080]   of how we did a lot of the effects and so on and so forth.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.080]   I look forward to that.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.760]   Alex Lindsey, thank you so much.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.680]   I know you got a call and at six AM, so we're going to let you get going and we're going
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.680]   to let everybody get going.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:04.960]   Thank you for being here.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.600]   I am going to go to a on vacation for the next couple of weeks.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.400]   So I'll miss a couple of back break week, least, but I think Alex is going to hold down the
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.400]   Ford in Japan.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.880]   We're going to figure out technically how we can do that.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.320]   Yeah, I got big pipes here.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.720]   He's got big pipes and 24 megabits.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.720]   All right.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.320]   You know, I brought all these drives.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   I'm downloading.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.600]   I think I have like a third of the internet downloaded now.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.760]   I'm going to back it up.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.760]   I'm going to back it up.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.680]   So just in case it goes down, you know, in this, in this trouble, they can call me and
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.680]   I'll just go.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   Yeah, I have it.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   All right.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.400]   Everybody, thank you for joining us.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.440]   Another Mac break is broke.
