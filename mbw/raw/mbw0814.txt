[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Renee and Alex. They're all here. Yay Renee's back.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.000]   We're gonna talk about the big rumors about nine new Macs.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.200]   We know they're out there, but when are we gonna get to buy them?
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.700]   There are still major chip shortages, but Apple might have dodged a bullet in the iPhone factory in China.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.800]   And NFL Sunday ticket. It looks like it's Apple's to lose. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   Podcasts you love.

[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   Oh, Apple, look who's back. Look who's back Renee Richie.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie of YouTube fame.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   - Hello, Renee. - Infamy.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   Hello, Leo. Can you tell us why you're in New York?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   I was filming an undisclosed video project with George Dao.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   - Nice. - Yes.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   - Yes. - Wow.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   I just couldn't get the shooting days arranged so that I could get Tuesday off.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   They're like, "No, no, it took us eight hours to set this up. You're going to sit down and film, son."
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   Wow. That's nice. That's fine.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   But it does dash my hopes that it was some sort of Apple briefing on the latest M2 MacBook Airs.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   But okay.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Oh, I guess.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Well, they had an event in New York. And I did stop by. They had at the Apple Store at Fifth Avenue.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   They had the winners of the macro competition.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   - And they had the photography team from Apple, like Delahaf, who runs product, and a bunch of the app--
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   - Oh, that's far. - And a bunch of the photographers. Yeah.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   That was really nice to see. And they went through the answer questions, they explained stuff.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   They had macro set up so you could go and shoot all these different objects at macro and test it out.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   It was very fun.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Well, hold the thought. Put a pin in it because I want to introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   Not that they need any introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Andy Ennaco of WG.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   B-H-A-Balsons. Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   - Hey there, Heather. - Hey there, hi there. Oh, there.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:41.480]   Also with us from 090.media and Office
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   - The facial captures working pretty well. - It works pretty well.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   - Polygon. - As always, if you look at the eyes, it's like that sort of dead, sort of emotionless,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   like serial killer eyes. - That's like top of the thing.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.480]   - That's a good way. - How can you tell the difference?
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   Actually, did you see that they are doing this with ABBA?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   This is completely not anything to do with Apple, but it is kind of a technology thing.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   - Yeah, it's a pretty cool setup. They went back and built digital versions of ABBA.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   I think ILM actually is doing this. They went back and built digital versions,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   and then they did motion capture with the current artists at their current age.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   Then they're mapping that back on to the CD characters.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   I'm showing it if you would show my screen. Sorry.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   Yeah, it's pretty good stuff.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   Then essentially, there's the motion capture with the original artists
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   and then the original ABBA team.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   Then what they're doing is putting them onto an LED wall that's going to be on stage.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   It sounds like the real trick that they're taking advantage of is they're going to build lighting rigs
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   into the theaters so that it's integrating the lighting with the performance that's on stage.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   Otherwise, it would just be an LED wall on stage with some CD characters.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   It's not really a hologram, then. It's a screen.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   It may be a hologram, but it could be, but it will look better.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   Don't they look sad? Andy, are you laughing?
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   No, no, I understand.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   The motion capture suits aren't that far off from what they used to wear.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   No, I know.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   The motion capture suits are...
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   You really have to have a lot of self-comps to get into one.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   So this is just a big screen, but you're saying because
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   with the practical lighting that makes it...
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   The practical lighting in the theaters.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   That's the theory.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   It fools you.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   Well, they had Tupac that was years ago in a hologram at Coachella.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   And they had Salindiales sing with Elvis on American Idol in any way.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   When they say hologram, a lot of times they're still being projected against some...
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.480]   they're projected against some kind of screen. Sometimes it's at an angle.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.480]   So what they do is it has a slight angle to it and has a bottom projector that goes up.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   A lot of times the brightness and the quality isn't as high as an LED wall can be.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   So it bends.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   And they're spending... See, there's the lights that we're talking about.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   Those are real.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480]   It's going to get tied in.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   So what will happen...
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   You can see there, the screen is projecting out things and they're literally integrating all of the things into the screen.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480]   So when it does things, so does the rest of the space.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.480]   And you see that all the time now in concert performances.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   I saw a really wild one in the hockey game where they project onto the ice.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   And it looks like the ice is falling apart and the Zamboni is going to fall in.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   It's very convincing because it has that...
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   There's doing something with...
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   It's Montreal potholes, Leo.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   That's nothing...
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   Was that Montreal?
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   That's Montreal potholes in the ice.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   And most of design does those.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   It does that one specifically is a company called Immersive Design.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   And they do a really good job.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   We saw it at the Olympics opening ceremonies.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   They're trackers sewn into the NHL players uniforms now on the shoulders.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   So the puck...
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   And the puck too.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   And they've made great leaps since that Fox gimmick of, "Hey, let's get the kids to watch by making the puck into a laser."
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   But it's actually more useful stuff.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   We can say, "Well, we want to basically label people so people can follow the action given that it's a tiny little...
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   Even at HD, it's a tiny don on a white background.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   We can do things to make this game more easy to ascertain."
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   This was also more easy to get data.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   Like, this isn't even new.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   This was 2016, 2017 at the Blackhawks projecting onto the ice, turning it into a pinball machine.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   And it's funny.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   It really does feel like they're coming up out of the screen.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   And it looks really good from one side.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   Right.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.480]   Yes.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   Perfect.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   They're shooting it.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   It looks really good.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   It doesn't look the same on both sides.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   Right.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   But you're right, Alex.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:08.480]   I've read an article a couple of weeks ago about how now there's part of negotiations between players, unions and teams is that, look, if you collect data on us on our performance, that data belongs to us.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   You can't even use that data to either improve training models or basically pass the... sell this data to the next person who's considering signing us to a contract.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   They can find some weird, stupid, unbiased, unfounded algorithm reason to turn us down.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   I don't know what data they're owning, but I can tell you that I've seen some of the data from some of these sports teams.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   And it's pretty amazing.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   It's all your speeds of every play.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   It is how often you touch the puck, how close you were, how often you're on one side of where ever you are in the quadrants.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   I mean, it's pretty dense.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   So what do they do with that?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   You can't table it and then change all your pivot table.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   I can...
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   But one good goon on the ice, one serious enforcer, and that negates all the data.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480]   It's a knock-o!
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   It's a knock-o's check in everybody.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   It's somebody!
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   When you have that much data, it actually, you can do some pretty interesting things.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   You'll notice things that you won't notice just watching the game.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   Like, I did a time lapse of construction one time for a big company, and we noticed that one of the carpenters was constantly walking back and forth.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   You don't notice that when you're in real time, but in time lapse, you notice that you see this guy bouncing back and forth, and we realize he's losing two hours a day.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   And it was because there was a little hump in the ground, and he couldn't pull his kit over it.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   And it was...
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   But they're literally losing that much for one person, and so they moved the hump, and then now he has it sitting next to him.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   I read somewhere that the automobile with the spews 10 gigabytes of data a second if you were to track it all.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   So you need massive data sets.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   That's why Elon needs neural link.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   Anyway, that was a little side venture.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   I just want to put this in the end of the space.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   If anybody wants to make a 3D Leo that goes forever, go ahead.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   It's free.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   I don't assert any copyright.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480]   Please.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.480]   We can make you a V-Tuber Leo.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   You could be a synthetic YouTuber.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   You could just have a...
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   Just do the show forever.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   He keeps showing up.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480]   We can't get rid of him.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   Macro photography.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   Shot on iPhone.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   Macro challenge.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   The winners.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   You were there at the announcement at the New York store.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   Let's look at some of these.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   Ooh.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   What?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   Sea glass.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   Like Guido Casanelli.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   So pretty.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   iPhone 13 Max.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   Very pretty.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   That's from Buenos Aires.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   There's a nice flower.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   The cave.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   It's a hibiscus Marco Calletta.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   iPhone 13 Pro.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   What did they tell you?
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   This is from Italy.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   It's out of here.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   Spider web art in nature.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   Prajwal.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   Chugul.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   From India.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   Wow.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   They had four of the more local winners there.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   They were all very excited.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   It was a lot of detail about the stuff that you...
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   It's hard to imagine all the...
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.480]   It's not just an Instagram camera.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   A lot of cameras look great on Instagram, but that team is so extra.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   Like they do a lot of work to make the greens really green.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   The reds really red.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   Like far beyond what any reasonable company should pay money for to have them go to that level.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   But they think about like what's...
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   They tried to detect what's out of the frame in case you move in that direction.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.480]   They can focus on it faster.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   And they leverage everything that they can get out of all the silicon and all the camera systems to...
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   To basically make it as easy as possible if you snap a picture of the second you want to.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   This is hard to do.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   By the way, look at the snowflakes in her hair.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   That's...
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   That's a Don Comerichka quality.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   And those were tax sharp.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   Like when those were...
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   They had those on the big wall, like the giant screen.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   And you could see that snowflake in vivid detail.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   So this is...
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   Alex...
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   Tough to do, right?
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   Because macro photography, the focal plane is so shallow.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   With a stamp, with a regular phone, with a DSLR.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   It's...
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   It's very hard to do.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   It is hard to do.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   It's really fun though.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   I mean, I will say that I take so many macro photos with my camera.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   Nothing is good as this.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   I don't really...
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   Do you need to tripod, use lights?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480]   No, like no.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   I'll be on a walk.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.480]   I'll be on a walk and just literally go, "Oh, that looks cool."
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   And I'll just lean up into it inside of a flower or something to...
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   And it's a really fun thing to do.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   But I have to say, the computational photography that the phone could do really is an assist.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   Because focusing, for instance, this is a drop of water on a leaf.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   Right.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   Focusing it properly.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   In fact, this looks like it's got pretty good depth of field, which...
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   Yeah, they don't have big glass or big sensor.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   Like, so they have to use big computers.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   It's not the same.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   It's all that you do to compensate for the lack of Z-index.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   And if it's low light, you can see it.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   Like, you can see that it did a little extra work.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   So you do have to give it a fair bit of light to get it to look relatively smooth.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   When it's...
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.480]   When it's doing the computational photography and it's a little grainy, you see it.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480]   Garbage in, garbage out.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.480]   You have to have enough information to make it work.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   Still, wow.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   This looks every bit as good as a high quality DSLR.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   Maybe better in the hands of a trained professional.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   So, nice job.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   These are all iPhone 13 Pro Maxes, I think.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   No, some of these pros.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   Yeah, well, the Pro Max is the only one that I macro mode.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   Nice.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   Could you do this out of 12?
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   Asks.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   I'm asking for a friend.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   I don't know.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.480]   You can get close, but you can't actually...
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   You won't actually go into a macro mode.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   It won't give you that focal length.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.480]   That's why Apple's telling everybody about it.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   It's basically the ultra-wide camera that they just dual-purpose for a macro.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   Some cameras put a secondary 2-megapixel macro
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   just so they can have a higher number of cameras on their spec sheet.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   That 2-megapixel camera is just a crime.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   It's horrible.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   So, the better camera phones use the ultra-wide camera and use that for the macro as well.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   Are they doing image stacking?
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.480]   Do they take multiple images as well?
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   Yes.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.480]   Bracketing and stacking.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   Bracketing and stacking, baby.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   That's basically what you do is you take so many photos because the silicon is so fast.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   There's not a lot of data.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   These aren't huge lenses.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   Some people wonder why can't Canon do this.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   There's just so much information coming off like a real camera lens.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   They don't have the same silicon.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   But when you have a camera lens that has this much data and you have a chipset as powerful as any of the modern SOCs,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   you can just crunch so many images at one time.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   Everything up till night mode.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.480]   You can basically do in real time on an iPhone now.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   It's almost unfair how many samples that camera is taking.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   It's true for most phone cameras, especially the Apple iPhone camera.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   How many different pictures is taking in one burst and then combining all that data?
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   This is why so many people get disappointed when they say, "You know what?
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   My first kid is being born.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   I'm going to buy a real camera."
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   Then they're explaining that this is not taking nearly as good pictures as my phone.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   It's all dark.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   I can't see anything.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   Generally, people ask me now, "What camera should I get?"
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   I said, "Just get a good phone."
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480]   Just get a good phone.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.480]   I mean, for composition process, you can do a lot of that without a regular camera.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.480]   You have to be at a certain level of -- I don't want to say at a certain level.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.480]   I mean, at a certain level of awareness, a certain level of desires, of goals, to really,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   really see a big difference because to be absolutely honest, absolutely.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.480]   I absolutely disagree with people who say, "Well, there's no difference between a phone
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   and a standalone camera anymore."
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   There absolutely is.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.680]   Usually in those fine details that are the difference between pictures that always look
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:48.560]   good on Instagram and pictures that are good enough that you'll blow it up to 8x10 and put
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.480]   it on the sofa table.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   That's usually the difference between the two.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.560]   But for most people, the thing is, if you don't care about, "Oh my God, there's so much
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:03.480]   like purple fringing on the background of that flare in the background."
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   No, I want to see that image of my --
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480]   of my kid.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.480]   I don't care that -- I don't care that there's a tiny little technical thing that means that
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   I can't use it as a bus ad.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.480]   Well, and part of this is the convenience because I can definitely tell the difference.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.480]   I mean, even with my old 5D Mark II, it's not very high resolution.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   I mean, 24 megapixels or whatever.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   But it's -- and I'm taking lots of those photos.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   And I can definitely -- everyone -- I run into the photos that I took.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   Even my DXO is still better than the iPhone as far as image quality and the little one that
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   used to put on the iPhone.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480]   Yeah, that one inch sensor.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.160]   So images, you go, "Oh, that was -- those are really great photos."
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.400]   The problem is, is that other than the DXO one, but with regular cameras, most of them
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.840]   don't have GPS and they don't have time and they don't have -- and so the thing is, is
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.000]   that I -- there's so many things that I just search for a location.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.160]   Like, "Oh, where's that photo?
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.660]   I'm just going to search for Washington, D.C. or Istanbul or Kigali or, you know, Seam
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   Reap."
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.560]   And it's just going to show me all the photos I took with my phone.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.160]   It's not going to show me any of the photos I took with my still camera.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160]   That's really hard.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   It's really hard.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   The super annoying thing is now, if you actually work -- if you have to do all this stuff for
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.960]   like a business, you need both now because the iPhone -- no camera phone can actually
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.720]   produce the images that a camera can produce, especially a high-end camera.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.480]   So like, almost every YouTuber will still have a $5,000, $20,000 camera, but you will
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.600]   see all of them, even the ones who hate the iPhone or the passion use Android all day
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   every day.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.520]   They will put down that camera and pull out an iPhone if they are trying to shoot something
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.640]   that moves from bright into dark light because nothing else can adjust that fast or give
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.400]   you that kind of consistency in an image.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.760]   And also when there are some images that you take -- and I've heard at least a couple
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.120]   examples of ILM having to do this too, where you take a couple shots just for a setup stage
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.080]   and a camera can't reproduce the lighting that you got with the iPhone.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   So those iPhone shots end up getting snuck into like these big motion pictures just
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.280]   because they caught them and they couldn't reproduce them in a standard way.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.640]   So it's frustrating because you can't get a silhouette.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.680]   It's better now, but for a while, photographers were saying, "I can't get a silhouette with
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   the iPhone."
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   Everything.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.600]   It's the most annoying camera in the world.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.840]   But sometimes you need to expose a lot more stuff because the background is too dark and
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.440]   they're like, "Oh God, I have this in my tool."
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.400]   You give up control.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.160]   So while the phone is going to do a better job in many, many cases, you give up the ability
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.240]   to say, "Oh, no, don't expose the -- I want to silhouette."
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.400]   With the stock camera is hard to do that with, but if you're shooting video and you
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   use something like filmic, you're going to have something that will get a lot of back.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   Manual controls.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.920]   Oh, and maybe Alex knows this too.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.880]   Netflix just put out a whole list of how to shoot with an iPhone for Netflix, which is
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   unprecedented.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.160]   You have to use filmic and you have to use various specific settings, but the iPhone
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.920]   12 and 13 are now approved for 4K Netflix cinematography use.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   Wow.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.280]   I don't know if they'd want you to shoot the whole film that way, but they may.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.880]   And a lot of times, again, a lot of us are using those little pickup shots, inserts and
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   so on and so forth.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.000]   And all of us, every time someone wants to do it with an iPhone, it's always filmic and
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.520]   it's always here exactly the settings that you need to set it to because it's really
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   easy in filmic.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.920]   Filmic has all these things that you can set it to and people get wonky about it and you
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.840]   have to set it to the right frame rate and you have to set it to the right compression
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.960]   rate and you have to set all those things up before you get going.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.160]   But now that it shoots ProRes and it's got a really good image, it's actually the content
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.280]   fills up your phone really quickly, but as long as you're ready to have a couple of them,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   it's like the phone has become the mag.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.560]   We used to, you know, the film that we used to put in was the mag that we put into the
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   camera.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.120]   Now the phone is like, you just shoot with this phone for a little while and then you
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.240]   hand it off to somebody, get another phone and start shooting with it because you filled
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.720]   it up and you take too long to offload it and it does just have another phone.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   This is the page on Netflix.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.480]   Non-approved cameras, recommended settings and best practices.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.280]   There are situations where the ideal camera for a particular shot may not be on our approved
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.760]   list.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:52.320]   But if you're going to use it, this is what you should have it set at.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.800]   It's interesting.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   There are a number of places online that have, you know, supposed settings for Filmic.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.240]   Filmic tweeted it out.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.240]   The Netflix approved settings.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   It's hysterical.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   Three or four days ago.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.680]   And that, by the way, we've talked about that before.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.760]   If you're a filmmaker or you're shooting video, the Netflix standards is just the best place
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.520]   to go for a recommendation of how to do something.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.200]   It's just, it's an incredible, I mean, they have so many things and so many processes
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.160]   that they want everyone to follow.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   And they've thought about it a lot.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.040]   Like, you know, there's been a lot of meetings and discussions to put things on that page.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.640]   You might want to read it before you go shoot something.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.640]   It's pretty useful.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.640]   They know what they're doing.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.640]   It's an incredible resource for the Filmic.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   And a lot of experience.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.280]   Yeah, they have, they have over 1,500 producers working for.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   Wow.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   And films.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.480]   Like, it's a big machine.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.640]   You know, and they have to, the reason they have all those standards and the reason they
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:55.360]   publish them is because it's just, they're just creating such a massive amount of content.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.920]   And if people start stepping off that path, it makes, it puts a wrench in the whole system.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.640]   Did they say at the Apple event that the macro photos that we're seeing were taken with
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.240]   just the stock settings or do they talk about manual settings?
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   They didn't say, I didn't say what it was taken.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.000]   I believe that they, it had to be like just a, I don't know.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.840]   They didn't even say anything about filter, but I don't believe any of them were overly
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.360]   filtered or even filtered at all either.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.200]   I mean, so there's a lot of questions like, did you use lighting?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.520]   Did you use Photoshop?
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.200]   Did you, what settings did you use?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   There's a lot of questions.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   No, they don't accept Photoshop.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.840]   They don't accept any like, they can't mind.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.240]   You can't edit it as a camera.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.400]   Uh, maybe that's why demand for the iPhone 13 is high.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.800]   Everybody wants to take macro photos.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.840]   This is a, no, Apple does not talk.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.480]   But various analysts release information.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.800]   Apple Insider has a note from JP Morgan analyst, Samick Chatterjee.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:58.040]   And I think they do surveys of the sell through people like the Verizon stores and so forth.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.520]   He says at AT&T, Verizon T-Mobile iPhones are accounting for 60% of shipments.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.320]   That's lower than the iPhone share prior to the launch of the Galaxy S22, but still higher
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   than any previous year.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.440]   The analyst says this implies a structurally higher market share for Apple in 2022 and then
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.360]   in past years.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360]   That's the good news.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.360]   Bandus's iPhone SE demand is lower than expected according to their survey.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.000]   Uh, 56% of representatives said that demand is muted in 2022.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.240]   Demand for the third generation iPhone SE, the analyst says, may even be lower than the
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.120]   second generation launched two years ago.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.160]   I wonder how much of that is just due to the fact that it looks like an old phone.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.760]   You know, the fact that it has that button right on the front there, the fact that it
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.960]   has the bezels, um, and it's not significantly smaller either, right?
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.600]   If it were, if it were a mini, maybe there'd be a market because it's smaller.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   But now, yeah, you're right.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.200]   It looks like it just an old phone.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   Looks like a, what is it?
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.640]   And it's also, it adds up.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   It adds up.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.400]   You, I just, I just got one from my kids and, and you know, it's $429 and then you're like,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.680]   well, 64 seems really anemic would get bump up a little bit on the memory.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.280]   And then, and then you get the case and then you get the enough.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.280]   Now you're up to almost 600 or over 600.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   That's a lot to spend.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.640]   You know, so when, once you go down that path, you're kind of like, well, I might as well
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.360]   just go with something bigger or I might as well get something else or something used.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.480]   And so it's, it is, I mean, I just bought one.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.360]   It's the right thing for what I was buying, but it was still like a little like, I could
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.000]   have almost gone a little bit higher and just started going into the new, newer, more bill,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.760]   the more built up versions of things.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.640]   Smart phone sales in the first quarter did fall globally.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.840]   11% Apple falling from the top spot to second place behind Samsung.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.680]   But I think some of that is recession inflation.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.080]   And it always happens as part of this like, yeah, as well.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.920]   So like a seasonal demand, exactly.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.960]   I guess like Apple's been historically bad at demand forecasting for iPhone SE going
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.720]   back to the original iPhone SE where they didn't make enough of them.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.440]   And now they're making too many of them.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.960]   And I think it's that this, this phone is really not a new phone.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.360]   Like basically they took, there was a four years between the iPhone and the iPhone SE
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   too.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.400]   And then there was only two years between the iPhone SE three.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   And I think normally they would have waited and done like an iPhone 11 style iPhone SE
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.080]   three, two years from now, but they just wanted to get 5G into everything.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.640]   So my guess is this is selling as well as a previous iPhone SE with an injection of 5G.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   And that's it.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.

[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.640]   Deja Vu all over again.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   Let's talk about that recycling story.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   Apple is doing quite well.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   They say now 20% of all material used in their products last year was recycled 20%.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:51.640]   This is from the Apple Environmental Progress Report.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   Recycled gold certificate.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   And as I said, they're reselling a lot of phones.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   It's a PDF.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   I can't open it.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   And Sarah Deachie on YouTube got to go to the plant yesterday and sort of video showing Daisy
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   just disassemble disassemble.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   They talked about those robots, which I have mocked.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   Lee Eman.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   Yes.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   All of those because well, how many?
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   Number five is a live Leo.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   I guess it's true.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.640]   They really are doing it.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   Never, never, never name your work animals.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   By the way, it's kind of time to slaughter it.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   It just complicates the decision.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   It breaks your heart.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   The robots are going to slaughter us.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   You can see how fast Daisy can take apart a human in which she gets going.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   Jesus.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   We know the wars come in Leo.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   We just dumb enough to keep building them.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   I mean, all the way to DC on that one.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   They warned us.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   They warned us with Terminator and with Matrix and we didn't listen.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Didn't listen.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   Please, please, please don't start agreeing with Elon Musk on everything.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   That's a bad path.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.640]   I'm agreeing with James Cameron and I forgot to make the Matrix and we're at the Whitechowskis.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   The Whitechowskis.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   I'm trying to find the, this is a beautiful report.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   Lots of pictures impossible to find the bottom line, of course.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.240]   In the meantime, in the Matrix where you can basically look like anything and wear like
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   anything.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.640]   They're choosing pleather trench coats.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   Rubber.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   Really?
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   Yeah, it's sexy.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   Come on.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   Have some style.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   You could look like David Bowie during the thin white Duke era.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   But no, let's have some rubber raincoats.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   Yeah, maybe a little seersucker action.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.240]   That wouldn't be so bad.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   Rubber raincoats, please.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.320]   All right, well, I'm not going to go through the whole thing.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.640]   You can download it and read it.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:40.840]   It's kind of like one of those quarterly reports.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.440]   Hard to find the, I'm going to have to find an art course.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.640]   Somebody read this and bottom line did.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   That would be a Mac rumor as people on that.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:56.440]   I mean, that does point to how committed they are to this.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:03.280]   Both as responsible corporate citizens, but also as we believe that this is part of us
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.920]   that we want people to know about, this is part of us that we're very proud of.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.360]   If they were just making reports to basically satisfy a whole bunch of requirements they
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.280]   might have internationally, there's simpler ways to do that than having typography and
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:22.400]   having photos and having this really, really long detail, not burdened with charts and graphs.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.400]   This is basically, we want to explain exactly everything that we're doing.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:30.080]   I do think that the times I've talked to Apple people about this, they feel as though this
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.840]   is one area in which they can kind of demonstrate that this is what a large company is capable
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   of doing.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.480]   So if a competitor or non competitor even says that this is impossible, we can't recycle
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.360]   at this level, no, this component, there's no way to reuse this material.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   The reason why they're documenting this is to say, well, actually, yes, absolutely,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   we can do this.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.720]   Here's how it's being done.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:56.240]   And so there are a lot of areas in which Apple decides to be, use its size to be a good
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.400]   influence, to be an influencer on good things that are not necessarily on the best interest,
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   sort of just on the best interest of Apple.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.800]   And the environment is one of those things.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.200]   It's one of those areas where when Apple says something, I do believe that they're being
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.040]   sincere about their motives for it.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.240]   It's true, somebody in the chat was saying, it would be even better if you could repair
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   your phone.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   Exactly.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   Go to that.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   Again.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.320]   There are ways to make it even better.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.800]   This is a good day for people.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   You could.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   I mean, yeah.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.640]   This is use of recycled materials over time.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.960]   These are products on the left launched in 2017 up to 2021.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.360]   And the black squares are recycled.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.840]   Products, you can see there are 100% recycled tin, for instance, 100% recycled rare earth
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.280]   elements.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.520]   The iPhone is now recycled gold.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.360]   So there's a definite improvement here.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   It's very clear.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.240]   Have we talked about that yet?
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.680]   After Google decided to get on the IFixit bandwagon, know if you want to buy replacement
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.840]   parts for pixels, go to IFixit.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.960]   They'll sell you genuine parts.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.200]   We won't get in the way of it.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   Meanwhile, Apple hasn't moved a lot on the big news that we've had so far was that if
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.160]   you go down seven flights of stairs into the basement behind a lock door under a leather
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.480]   lock door and look in a file cabinet underneath the sign called Beware of the Leopard, we might
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.120]   allow you to buy this kind of component if you are qualified by our screening process.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.160]   And we haven't seen any movement on that yet.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.920]   Whereas Apple and Samsung are both saying.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.400]   I think they don't want to say it.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.840]   But I think they just don't have the parts like they can't keep up with making it with
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.360]   selling the actual phones.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.680]   And they announced this not anticipating that we would still be here from two years.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.240]   And they're just like, we can barely get phones on the shelves.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.880]   We don't want to say anything because you're going to get mad at us.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.400]   And I think Google has the parts for the Pixel, which I'm not saying to be a jerk.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   I just think that they do.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.400]   They probably do.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   They probably do.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.560]   Well, also Samsung benefits by being both a manufacturer of all those components as well
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.000]   as the back to the phone.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.960]   But still, it at least prompts you to ask the question of were they really, really serious
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.040]   about this?
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:03.360]   Or was this just a we're hoping this will blow over or we're hoping that we can regulate
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   our way out of this?
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.520]   It's a good time for Apple to basically talk about it.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.520]   Pick three.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.080]   Pick three things we know we can deliver.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.280]   It'll get everyone off our back to pick three things, the easier three things, screens.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   You do screen.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   Okay, we can do screen.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.880]   They're like, we don't have a screen.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.320]   So one other thing Apple's done, which I think everybody noticed when we got, if you got
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.440]   a Mac Studio or Mac Studio display is the really kind of cool packaging.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.560]   There's a reason they were using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.880]   They say that avoided more than 400 metric tons of plastic.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.080]   It was a very cool one.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   It used the oils.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.800]   Like, I was like, this is a really big package for the thing that I got.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   Well, they have to protect it, right?
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.040]   No, no, I understand that.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.400]   I was just like, I understand they say the plastic.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.480]   I'm just wondering if you know, sometimes what happens is we go, well, it's good for
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.800]   the environment in this side, but what happens to the side?
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.560]   How do they make the corrugated fiber?
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.040]   Like ethanol is not really good for the, like, right.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.120]   They eliminated all plastic packaging in the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.960]   No polypropylene wrap around the box you might have noticed.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.120]   Including the charger?
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.760]   The only thing is the charger.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.400]   So they said we wanted to retain the benefits of plastic wrap without the environmental impact
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.680]   while creating a more accessible boxing experience.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.120]   So they developed this alternative that relies on, and I didn't get it in the 13.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   So you can verify this.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.760]   They do small fiber-based pull tabs, which is, I think, nicer.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.280]   It's a lot easier to open.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   Yep.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.200]   That avoided the...
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:44.560]   For the polypropylene wrap on the iPhones, 600 metric tons of plastic, they have a more
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.160]   elaborate in-depth and just insane packaging design team than most companies have actual
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.440]   product design teams.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.720]   That team is so good, so smart, and so well funded.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.000]   It's like little origami statues, everything they make into packaging.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.640]   They also talk about responsible sourcing of the fiber, so they are aware of that as
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   well.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.440]   For reduced plastic and packaging by 75% since 2015.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.360]   Good on you, Apple.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.360]   No, absolutely.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.080]   I would love to see a feature article or feature of documentary about the people who designed
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   packaging for.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.680]   Those boxes were amazing.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   I'm not kidding.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.040]   So I had to go absolutely...
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:29.040]   Do one of those things you do every five years, or even pre-Marie Kondo.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.560]   I have to put my hands on every single thing I own to make sure that's something that I
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.600]   still need to have or store.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.240]   And got into this big, huge box.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   I didn't know what it was.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:42.600]   And it was just the last time I moved, I was saving every single really cool Apple box.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.680]   And there are so many of them that even now, I'm like, "I know, I don't even use this
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.640]   as headphones anymore, but the box is just such a beautiful object."
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.520]   And the corners are absolutely square.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.920]   You could hurt yourself with it.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.240]   And it feels like I need to save this because I'm going to have something important I want
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.200]   to save in a box like this.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.120]   They're just even on a top shelf, they look beautiful.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.160]   And it ruins your experience with everybody else.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.680]   If everyone doesn't keep up with it, you open it up and you're like, "Oh, that's not
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   Apple."
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   They put that little sticker there.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   They have extra tape.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   It has a box.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.480]   It's just like, "Oh, a little tension of detail here."
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.800]   It is very much like I become very judgmental buying so many Apple products.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.920]   When I open a box, I make a decision about the company pretty quickly.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.560]   So it's usually not a good decision.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:37.120]   I think that says a lot positive or negative about us as a fan base that now that the
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.400]   phones are really, really close to each other and you can't necessarily say that, "Oh,
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   hands down.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   Apple has the best phone."
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.400]   "Oh, okay, but look at that box.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.640]   Look at the box that damn pixel came in."
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:56.120]   So addressing repairability, there's a whole page on, they call it longevity.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.600]   But this is interesting.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.520]   The first generation iPhone, the only thing that could be repaired was the SIM tray.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.960]   You could knock out dents in the back of that.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.520]   You said you could knock out dents in the back of that.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   You could knock out dents in the back of that.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   You could knock out dents in the back of that.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   You could knock out dents in the back of that.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   You could knock out dents in the back of that.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.560]   People at retail stores, Apple authorized service providers in central repair locations,
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.920]   SIM tray battery, haptics, rear camera, main logic board display, bottom speaker, top speaker,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   and enclosure.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.280]   I mean, they're definitely paying attention to repairability.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.040]   They don't let third parties, perhaps, do it or maybe they don't have the parts to sell.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.720]   But they definitely pay attention to that as they should.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:43.280]   When they talk about the self-service repair, that's important too.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.440]   I think you're right, though, Renee.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.440]   They would probably like it to be even more expansive if they only had the parts to do
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.440]   it.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.440]   They could get some easy wins here.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.240]   It seems like they certainly want to do it.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.640]   They talk about recycling.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:00.280]   They talk about Liam and the other robots.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   Daisy.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   Daisy.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.920]   Disassembly robots.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.800]   They're optimizing how our robots function, enabling a robot to feel by using high-frequency
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.840]   force feedback and machine learning.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   So it can adjust.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   It's just an iPhone.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   It can be a point in seconds, Leo.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.040]   And you're calling me alarmist.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.280]   It's to feel by going through empathy sessions.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.280]   Empathy.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   Empathy.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.280]   How do you feel?
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   You don't feel anything yet?
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   Let's talk about your circuitry there.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   Liam.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   No, it's...
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   I don't remember this.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.960]   There was this one episode, when Joss Whedon was writing the X-Men for a while, he figured
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.660]   out that, their computers were so used to violence. They would just have learned violence. And
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.640]   all this thing does is destroy I-phones. So I'm just saying, you've built a machine and
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.920]   you've trained it to destroy. I know how to take this apart. county tale. What about you?
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:50.480]   The funny thing is we had a—we—I was working in an artificial life company a long time ago,
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:56.100]   and we would train this little dude, this little four legged creature, to you'd give them
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.840]   feedback, like, "Good, good, good, good, good, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad." And if you started
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.080]   giving it cross, you know, like, you would sometimes tell it was good and sometimes tell
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.000]   it was bad. When it got to the stimulus that you were doing that around, it would start
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   to shiver because it couldn't figure out which way it should go. And I realized—and
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.600]   we realized, like, it gave me a whole insight into people of, like, you know, giving people
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.880]   cross, you know, like, telling them something's good or bad with the same stimulus.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   It was—it was—
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   Yeah, they did that with mice. That was 25 years ago.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   That was a button to get a reward or they press a button and get shocked. And if they
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.520]   couldn't tell which was going to happen, they just sat down on the floor and cried.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.520]   2001. 2001 is space, obviously. How went nuts because it was given to completely conflicting
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.000]   borders of its equal importance.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Right.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Very—if you're interested, I recommend downloading the Environmental Progress Report,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.440]   and they've had it audited by independent third party and, you know, it really—I
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.240]   have to say, it's pretty darn impressive. You know, there's a certain amount of green
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.680]   washing that all corporations do, but in this case, it seems like there's a clear commitment
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.240]   to making their stuff better.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.440]   And given how much they sell and make, that's a big deal.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:11.320]   Yeah. If you want just to do a PR exercise, there are simpler and cheaper ways to do it
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320]   than what they're doing here.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.840]   So this is—again, why I tend to believe them when they're—they're sincerity here.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.120]   All right. Let's take a little break. Come back with more. We've got a great panel, as
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:27.680]   always effect the entire team is here. Renee Ritchie from YouTube fame. Mr. Andy Inaco
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.480]   of public radio fame, Alex Lindsay of 24/7 working fame.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.120]   He did the double Isaac. He did it.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   He did it.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.800]   Double Isaac on the love boat.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.640]   Our show today brought to you—
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   The bartender.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   [laughter]
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:48.720]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa. Hey, if you have a business and you have a list
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:55.360]   of customers or addresses, suppliers, contact list, you should know it's rotting away as
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:01.120]   we speak. The people move, addresses change, emails change, phone numbers change, names
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.000]   change. There is a way to keep your data more up to date, and that's the address experts
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.680]   Melissa. To ensure your business is successful, customer information has to be accurate.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:17.360]   Melissa is the leading provider of global data quality and address management solutions,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   37 years in the business. That gives you some idea of how experienced they are, completely
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.000]   independent. More than 10,000 businesses know them as the address experts. A renewal rate
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.040]   of 92% tells you people are pretty darn happy with Melissa. Perhaps that's because the typical
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.920]   return on investment for Melissa customers is 25%. Melissa reached a big milestone. I
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:45.800]   wanted to congratulate them last year. 30 billion with a B North American address lookups in
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:53.440]   the year 2021. That's the most ever because bad information is a growing problem in every
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.120]   business with Melissa. You can verify not just addresses, but emails, phone numbers,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:02.320]   names, and you could do it in real time if you want with the Melissa API. Their global
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.280]   address for verification service verifies addresses for 240 plus countries and territories at the
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.920]   point of entry. They also have data matching to eliminate duplicate customer information
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.400]   in your database. That's a big deal. That saves you postage mailing costs and eliminates
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:23.240]   clutter and duplicates. You could do identity verification, reduce risk, and ensure compliance.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.040]   You could do geocoding, convert addresses into latitude and longitude. You could do email
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.720]   verification. These are some of the services Melissa offers, remove up to 95% of bad email
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.120]   addresses from your database. You can use Melissa anyway that works for you on-prem
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.200]   as a web service. That FTP site I mentioned, you can use software as a service. They have
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.600]   a lookups app on iOS and Android to search addresses names at your fingertips. Of course,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.360]   an amazing API, which means you can build Melissa into your own customer service platform
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:02.560]   or shopping cart. Melissa takes your data seriously, by the way. They undergo continuous
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.880]   independent security audits because they're committed to data security privacy and compliance.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:14.600]   They're SOC 2 HIPAA and GDPR compliant. You're data safe in good hands, as they say, with
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.080]   Melissa. If you sign up for a service level agreement, you're going to love their 24/7
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:25.480]   world famous support. They are the best in the business. It's not just me that says
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   it. They were named to the Data Quality Magic Quadrant by Gartner for the second year in
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:35.400]   a row this year. G2 Crowds 2022 report ranks Melissa as a leader in address verification
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.760]   and data quality software. Look, you need Melissa. Make sure your customer contact data is up to

[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:16.120]   Melissa.com/twit. Thank you, Melissa. On with the show, we go. Should we do some rumors?
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:23.160]   Mark Gurman, I thought this was a really interesting rumor in Bloomberg. Apple is
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:31.080]   reading several new Macs with Next Generation M2 chips as many as nine Macs. And maybe you
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:37.400]   can explain this, Renee, according to developer logs. That's something Apple tries to avoid,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.800]   because a lot of times people who are testing these devices, they put apps on them, maybe
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:47.000]   they put their favorite non-standard Twitter client or something like that. And then the
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.360]   developer gets logs back. And sometimes there's unique characteristics about future devices.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.520]   It's got a different screen display or it's a different version of iOS or macOS. Or it
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.600]   has cores that you've never seen before. There's no 12 core CPU right now.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.000]   You can kind of fingerprint it, in other words, pretty easily.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Mark Gurman, yes. And they come up with different ways of trying to avoid this. But
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.360]   sometimes things happen. People are under stress. They just load something up and down.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.400]   Or you forget to turn off like send Geekbench to server. Little things like that.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:23.640]   It'll tell you a mistake. According to Mark, the company is testing at least nine new Macs with
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:31.480]   four different M2 chips. M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, M2 Ultra, maybe? I don't know.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:37.960]   That would be four. The successors to the M1 line. Oh, yeah. With third-party apps in its
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:43.240]   app store, according to the logs, which were corroborated by people familiar with the matter.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:49.400]   The move is a key step in the development process, suggesting the new machines may be
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:56.040]   really nearing release in the coming months. Could we see nine new Macs in June?
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.720]   I don't feel like I'm not in June. That'd be a long time. Going down a bad path.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:07.560]   Yeah. You know, getting slow, like one of the issues is the M1 Mac started coming out in
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.280]   November of 2020. And at a certain point, Intel's going to look over and go, oh, not so easy
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.680]   to keep up those updates, is it? And I don't think Apple wants that. But at the same time,
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.880]   it took them a while to get the first generation of the entire M1 family ship. They started with
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:28.200]   M1 baseline in November, and then went to Pro and Max in October. And then just this March,
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:33.480]   they went to Ultra, and that's 18 months. So depending, it's not too soon at all to start
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.840]   getting M2 Max. It's been over 18 months already. I'd love to see at least the baseline M2s,
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:45.880]   the MacBook Air or MacBook, whatever they call it, the little MacBook Pro, not the real MacBook Pro,
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.680]   and the M2 Mac Mini, M2 iMac, all of those, I think, are really due for an upgrade.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.560]   I don't think this is a proper form for size shaming.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.600]   I know we're speaking extemporaneously here, but...
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:07.080]   So we know that the one Mac that has yet to drop is the Mac Pro, the one upgrade.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:11.640]   Yes, these original M1s are starting to get a little long in the tooth.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.320]   Would they wait till November or they wait till this fall?
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:20.600]   I think... I was surprised we didn't see a MacBook Air by now.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:26.280]   Because that's one that makes absolute sense to make sure that you have stock on hand,
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.880]   you have people who are not holding off, not spending their money elsewhere,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:34.680]   because this is such a great prime time college and high school computer.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:42.040]   I think that we do have to add the MacBook Air and the Mac Mini to the list of
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.080]   machines that Apple hasn't promised they're going to update by the end of 2022, but 2022,
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.400]   but we all understand that it's not a real Mac Mini.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:59.080]   It's a MacBook Air in a desktop with extra ports on it, and that's pretty much it.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:04.360]   So I'm very much looking forward to them shipping all three in 2022.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.440]   So I believe a lot of this stuff.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.680]   And you want your single core, Bruce Lee, you've been waiting for that,
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.560]   because all of the M1 family have the same single core performance.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.480]   That's right. I keep pointing that out.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.000]   Although we shouldn't expect an M2 to be double the speed.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.480]   It's going to be 10, 20, 30%, maybe.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.160]   It'll be about 10% faster just on frequency alone,
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.680]   because the new process, the second generation 5nm process
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.960]   gives you about 5% extra frequency, and then Apple pushed A15 between 3% and 5%,
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.280]   depending on single core and multi core performance.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.680]   So you'll get about 10% just off the frequencies,
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.520]   and then it really gets weird, because people were so down on the A15 saying,
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.120]   "Oh, it's not a big update."
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.760]   But like I said in my benchmark LARP video,
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.480]   you can't just be a tourist on measuring silicon anymore.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.120]   Like there's so many apps, you can download them, press a button,
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.080]   it gives you a number, and that's meaningless if you don't know what it means.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.320]   And A15, it's a beast.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.400]   It is between 2.5 and 27% faster,
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.520]   depending on the workload and the latency,
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:09.240]   because it's got a lot bigger on-die cache for both level 1 and level 2 cache,
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.160]   or system level and level 2 cache.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.280]   But also, the efficiency allows it to do things.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   Like it is more efficient than M1 while being faster frequency
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.920]   and faster silicon architecture.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.880]   So that means that Apple can again increase all of these things
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.120]   and keep them in the same containers even smaller.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.320]   Meanwhile, and I'm not even joking, NVIDIA and Intel
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.360]   are wrestling over the last few bits of power in a house outlet,
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.640]   and at a certain point, you'll no longer be able to plug something in in a house anymore.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.360]   That just means that Apple has so much runway left to keep innovating with these chips.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.320]   It's really impressive.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:45.240]   Well, this is what the apparently the lineup,
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.320]   according to again, to Mark Gurman, will be a MacBook Air with an M2 chip.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:56.920]   This is code named J413, 8 CPUs based on the A15, 10 GPUs,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.160]   and that's up from 8 GPUs in the current MacBook Air.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.280]   So you may be seeing...
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.040]   A15 has 5 GPUs at the top end.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.760]   Okay.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.080]   Okay.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.720]   You're doubling that again.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:12.200]   A new Mac Mini with an M2, J473, same specs as the MacBook Air.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.360]   There's also for the Mini M2 Pro variation in testing.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.880]   That's kind of good news.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.320]   That's the J474.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.760]   The question there is, is it 4 efficiency and 8 performance or 2 efficiency
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.960]   and 10 performance?
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   Because the other big deal about A15 is the efficiency core has got 30% faster.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.680]   They've got so much faster and they don't have to use a performance core as much,
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.520]   which saves even more power on the chip.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.680]   It's a level of ludicrousness we're getting with these things.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.120]   But we should also...
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:42.840]   I would like to say that if you're just doing general kind of computing,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.080]   email and browsing and stuff like that,
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.920]   it's not going to be...
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.280]   Will it be noticeable improvement performance?
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.000]   Well, I mean, you've been fine for five years.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.520]   That's all you're really doing.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.720]   You've been fine for the last five years.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.520]   Exactly.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.040]   The efficiency cores are what you check now.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:58.440]   The biggest...
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.400]   30% faster.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.000]   Your meal will pop up 30% faster.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.120]   Leo, does that make a huge difference?
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.840]   No.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.640]   The biggest difference is your fans don't come on anymore.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.760]   That's the big difference.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.400]   Yes, that's the big difference.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:07.960]   It doesn't get hot.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:08.840]   If you hate fans.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.560]   I'm very...
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.360]   You know, I bought...
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:17.160]   As you know, an M1 Mac Mini finally gave up and just bought it from my office in the other room.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.360]   And it's just...
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.320]   It can't tell the difference.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.040]   And they're all the same.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:20.520]   The max...
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.000]   Ultra...
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.240]   Max, the studio, the pro...
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.520]   You need to buy a separate space heater.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.400]   That's the biggest difference.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.960]   It's not just heat.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.640]   I mean, when you start having a lot of these,
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   I've got a lot of them running around right now.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.520]   It starts to actually turn into real energy savings and actual cash dollars
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.320]   that you are saving.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.560]   Like when you think about something running one eighth,
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.400]   the amount, it's not just the fans.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.520]   The fans are turning on because you're using a lot of energy.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.440]   So the fact that they're using a quarter of the energy
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.600]   means that you're paying less to run them.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.680]   And if you're running them all day and you're running them hard
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.280]   and you're running lots of them,
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.400]   it's going to start turning into measurable savings just for operation.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.480]   Okay.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.000]   The same thing with longevity as well.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.600]   Yeah, longevity.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.960]   I'll say you need more max, Leo.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.640]   Alex, say you need more max.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.520]   Get real safe.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.160]   I'm just, you know.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:08.760]   I'm just saying.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.000]   Well, maybe you didn't keep like buying like 100...
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.400]   100 Mac minis and just stacking them up on top of each other
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.760]   and putting in a closet that would be over.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.360]   I haven't bought 100.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.280]   I just bought 20.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.080]   I've bought 100.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:21.560]   It's max.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.760]   It's one fifth of 100.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.920]   20.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.240]   Wow.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.760]   Between between Oh and I know and myself, I have, I think I have,
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.280]   I think I have nine of them right now, of them, of them,
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.360]   of them, of Mac minis and then I have one ultra,
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.160]   I don't know, of the studio, not an ultra studio in the,
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.280]   and the whatever.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.560]   And then the, then the company has probably another 15.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:41.960]   Wow.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.920]   Over 20.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.560]   Wow.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.360]   Kind of amazing.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.040]   Why so many?
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.960]   You didn't want to wait for the pro?
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.560]   No, we use them for office hours and for remote.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.800]   So Oh and I know sends them out with our kits.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.840]   So the M1s, what's great about them is we bought them specifically
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.520]   because they run iPad apps.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.880]   So there's an iPad app that lets us run the Blackmagic 6K camera.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.120]   So we bought them so that we can, we can use Bluetooth
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.760]   that attach to that as well as the iPad app that lets us
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.120]   control our sound devices stuff.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:14.040]   And so, so the, so we have, we bought, so we had 15 of those for our kits.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.280]   And then, and then I use them because Zoom will put out out of a Mac,
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.840]   but not a PC for ISO, 1080p ISO is out of every computer.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.280]   If you have a card for it.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.600]   And so we just stack these M1s out.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.400]   So every M1 we'll put out for Zoom.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.440]   So, so when we do office hours, we have all 20 go out into the switcher,
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.560]   you know, from Zoom ISO.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.000]   So it's, so it's a really useful way to do something.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.760]   Because then it doesn't have the latency that we feel here
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.800]   every once in a while.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.480]   Because we're just talking inside the same show
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.440]   and we're just going in from the back end and grabbing all those videos.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.080]   Nice.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:47.640]   And so, yeah.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.560]   Entry Level MacBook Pro with an M2 chip also on this list,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.080]   code name J493.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.720]   It's essentially the MacBook Air with a fan,
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.120]   just like the original 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:00.840]   Had I touched bar?
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.920]   And a touch bar, you think?
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.080]   No.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.720]   I hope not, but I think it's a good change.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.440]   It ain't so.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.800]   You can touch it wherever you want.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.040]   It's just not going to throw your extra for it.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.560]   A 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M2 Pro and Max.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.600]   So this is really very much like the previous
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.440]   tranche just with M2s, right?
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.640]   Yep.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.120]   Uh...
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.560]   The tail going from 9th to 10th gen.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.440]   12 CPU cores, 38 graphics cores in the Max up from 10 and 32.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.200]   And here's your i5 i7 and i9.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.680]   64 gigs of memory.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:36.120]   That's one big difference is the memory is tied to the processor on Apple's platforms.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.040]   So, yeah.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.480]   16-inch MacBook Pro, M2 Pro and Max.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.360]   And a Mac Pro,
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.720]   code name J180.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.040]   And that'll use an Ultra.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:55.000]   So, um, there's also a Mac Mini with an M1 Pro chip.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.640]   Oh, we mentioned that.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.400]   J374.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.000]   Would you want an 18-inch MacBook Pro with a M2 Pro?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:03.240]   No.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.120]   A new battleship and you have to carry on.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.240]   No, I don't.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:07.640]   No.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.400]   14 is a good size.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.840]   I was actually looking at, uh,
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.040]   Windows PCs last night because I feel, I mean, kind of embarrassed that I don't have any
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:23.160]   thing running windows and I thought I probably should, you know, just, you know,
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.360]   Microsoft's problem, not yours.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.240]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:25.720]   Should be doing you.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:32.040]   Um, and I, and I was looking at 16 inches, but they, you know, they're four and a half pounds and I just, yeah.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.520]   Yeah, no, I don't know.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.240]   It doesn't seem like a good idea.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.960]   You and Stephen Sonofsky just can't go back.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:40.600]   Can't go back.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.240]   I can't go back.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:49.240]   So, uh, the real question is, okay, I believe all of these, uh, you know, obviously they're in
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:49.800]   the logs.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:54.520]   They must be real, but that doesn't mean they're going to be released in the next month or two.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.720]   Or are they?
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.600]   No, probably staggered.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.560]   Staggered.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.080]   It'll be staggered the way that M1 was.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.280]   So we'll get like the M2 and then we'll get the M2 Pro and Max and then we'll get the M-
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.280]   What will we see at WWDC?
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.120]   What's, what's your best guess?
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.160]   Max Pro is still my guess.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.840]   Like, we don't get it, but we'll see it.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.560]   We'll see it.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.360]   There's ample precedent for that.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.960]   I think twice before they've announced that they've shown off a Mac Pro without shipping it.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.600]   But it's kind of upside down if you talk about an M2 Ultra before you talk about the M2,
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.040]   M2 Pro and M2 Max.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.800]   The Mac Pro may not have M1 or M2.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.520]   Apple could like just throw a wild ball and call it like X1 or something.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.400]   Oh, well, that's.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.560]   Because like it's quad.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.720]   Like what is, what does a quad M1 even look like?
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.800]   We're in, we're in unusual times, Leo.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.760]   Everything is up for grabs.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.040]   Marketing.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.480]   Honestly, I think this would all be much more rational if we didn't have the supply
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:44.200]   chain shortages, the COVID shutdowns, all of those issues are really throwing a monkey wrench in
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:44.680]   the schedule.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.640]   I think even now Apple probably doesn't know what it's going to announce in June.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.480]   They're still trying to figure it out.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.520]   It's amazing that they're shipping like we still can't get a PlayStation 5 on a shelf and it's
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.480]   been two years, Leo.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.960]   And like Apple still, Apple's at least shipping this stuff.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.160]   It's a logistical miracle.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.480]   Are you intimate with Apple?
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.520]   Apparently many people are.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.160]   The brand intimacy rankings are out.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.360]   And Apple is.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.320]   That's quite heartbreaking.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.840]   I don't know what the hell this means.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:17.960]   Don't, don't, don't.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:26.120]   The report generators, MBLM, measure brand intimacy by examining users' emotional connections to a
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:31.880]   brand, including the characteristics of their bond across categories such as nostalgia,
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.960]   indulgence, and identity.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.560]   They also measure the intensity of a user's connection with the brand.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.160]   You'd think Apple would win this hands down.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.400]   But no Disney's number one.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:42.760]   Yes.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.920]   You guys know.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.160]   You guys know you're intimate.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.280]   You're intimate with Disney.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.680]   Number two is Tesla.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.000]   Yeah, God.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.560]   Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't put the words panel gap in anything you've ever seen
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.040]   in Twitter.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.560]   You've got a thousand like eight weeks back at you.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:08.440]   I thought this is, this is like what Apple, what Apple fandom was in like 1992.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.960]   Tesla fandom is today.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.840]   It's not as basically brand intimacy, not necessarily a good thing.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.240]   They're the.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:18.920]   Brand codependency is that what you're looking for?
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.960]   I'm just, I'm just saying that if, you know, if, if, if Elon got high and just say, as a joke,
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:29.720]   saying now go out and kill in my name, it would be a very, very bad day in every market in which Tesla operates.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.840]   This is a dark show.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.960]   There is a, I feel like there's a lag in this because number three is Apple.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.840]   Number four is Sony.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.240]   I didn't even think they were surprising.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:41.720]   I think they were surprising.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.880]   That might have been true a few years ago.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.480]   He said he has five on HP.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:45.880]   Okay.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.840]   Then YouTube, Renee, you'll be happy to hear that.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.560]   Then Mercedes traders, Joe's.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:55.240]   Do you have Trader Joe's in Canada?
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.360]   I don't think you even have though.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:56.840]   No.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.080]   No.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.840]   And I got to say, what's a lot of these?
[00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.480]   This makes no sense.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   It goes, it goes both directions.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.120]   Like with Trader Joe's is a good example of there's a lot of people that like them and a lot of people that really don't like them.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.480]   You know, there's when, you know, like me, like I, I, I don't like really hate Trader Joe's.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.000]   It's just wonky.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.280]   The whole store is wonky.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:19.160]   And I, and I, but there's people like my, my sister and my brother love Trader Joe's and they,
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.560]   they get tons of stuff from Trader Joe's and I'm just like, when, when whole foods started putting,
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.560]   replacing all the food with their own food, I was like, if I wanted to go to Trader Joe's,
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.240]   I go to Trader Joe's, but I come here because I want, I want other products.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.920]   You know, Bob the Mounties or something.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:39.320]   Let's see. Who else, who else is in our list?
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.280]   That's a weird list.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.240]   It's a weird list.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.040]   It's a weird list.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.480]   Like I don't even know how they get that data.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.400]   Like it's like Android and Sega.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.080]   I'm going to throw this out right now.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.480]   Apple rated very high in what ML, MBLM caused stages.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.200]   Stages identify the depth and degree of intensity in the relationship between consumers and brands.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.520]   Apple ranked specifically very highly in bonding.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.600]   When a consumer becomes attached and is committed to a brand.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.640]   Very uncomfortable survey.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.760]   I think we're bonded.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.640]   They also rank highly in sharing.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.840]   That's when a brand and its consumers learn more about each other.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.000]   Influencing each other.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.280]   Okay.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.280]   We shouldn't be talking about brands or companies in these terms.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.400]   This is not healthy for us.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:19.800]   This is gross.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.200]   We should, we have a, we have a, we have a, we have a completely
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.320]   commercial relationship.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.840]   If they make nice things, I will buy them.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.440]   If they don't, I will buy somebody else's.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.760]   That is the extent of our relationship with these companies.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.360]   This is, this is a lot, a lot about made up stats.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.520]   It's not, they, they, they made up statistics and they made up the methodologies for them.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:43.240]   And I'm, I'm sure that there are some analysts who find some sort of value in the raw data.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.680]   But basically this is my, this is my annual report that costs $5,000 to access us to tell you
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.760]   how many fliff lumbens you're going to be able to, you're going to be able to in the growth period.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.240]   And unfortunately.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.200]   That's 10,000.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.640]   We'll show you how to get higher next year.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.640]   We'll show, we'll show you the numbers.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.040]   It's like a cult where you have to keep buying like more expensive, more expensive,
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.400]   like less than some classes.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.520]   I mean, that, yeah.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.320]   That's how it works.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.160]   That's how a lot of the magic quadrant works.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.000]   But the thing that concerns me about this is we do live in a time of unprecedented brand
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.160]   affinity and zero attention span.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.200]   And I know I've mentioned this before, but like when I was younger, if there was a problem with a
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.520]   product and there was a recall that company almost went on a business and we've like,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.600]   we've had people refusing to give up phones that blow up.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.680]   Like they just want to keep because they love so much.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.640]   Like we've entirely inverted our cortisol levels or something.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:35.160]   It's sometimes hard for us to realize that we don't, we should never love a company.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.680]   We shouldn't even love a product.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.920]   We should just like what it does for us.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   And then every single year we need to like renew that contract and reevaluate it.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.800]   And that's the reason why I've been using Macs every single day for since I was like 20
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.680]   since I was old enough to afford one is because every time I'd make that evaluation,
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.800]   it passes that test.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.240]   There was a great, well, not great.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.920]   There was a long, great in the size sense article in the Wall Street Journal about the
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.280]   chips speaking of the, I don't want an M2.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.880]   And I got real excited when they said they interviewed Johnny Suruji, but I don't know
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.600]   where the interview went because they only had about two quotes from Johnny.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.480]   It was so weird.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.840]   And like that Pierre is in there like, I think with like an old quote saying that Intel's going
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.520]   to come back and then they have to have Gelsing's old quote saying he wants to win back Apple's
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.240]   business. I was like the weird, it was like a weird interview.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.400]   I, yeah.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.400]   Don't read it.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.840]   It's one of those great, but I want, I need Johnny.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.400]   I want more.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.760]   I wanted the Johnny.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:38.280]   I feel like this was, this was in the April 16th print edition.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.720]   And that's a weekend edition.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.640]   So I think it's like they do these features for the Saturday Journal.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.600]   Enterprise piece.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.040]   It's, yeah.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.480]   And it's, it was pretty puffy.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.680]   So I'm just going to mention it and, and move on.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.360]   I love like just to go, just to focus on Johnny for one.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.120]   I love his philosophy because like you, we've heard him, for the first time we've heard him
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.720]   on stage now with all the M1 announcements.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.200]   I love that.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.600]   He's just like, Silicon is unforgiving.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.360]   Our only job is to make sure that given the constraints of thermal envelope and time we deliver
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.520]   Mac, like we run Mac applications faster than any other applications on the planet.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.080]   And that's like a very pure goal for that team.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.840]   And those SOB is deliberate.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.880]   Like it's, it's amazing how that focus has filtered down into a really interesting range of
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.960]   products that we've never really seen, like high efficiency desktops before, and what that
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.080]   enables them to build.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.160]   So I'm impressed with his whole, in his whole organization in Apple.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.000]   I think that we're, you know, we're seeing this in a, in a couple of different places where
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.320]   the ecosystem is starting in many, for many companies becoming really important.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.920]   Like it is the fact that Apple owns all of those things.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.600]   You know, and we see that in other places in our area, Blackmagic is slowly just adding
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.640]   all these things to all the, you know, and to where you go, well, yeah, I could buy
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.400]   another camera, but then I'd have to figure out how to shade it.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.320]   Look, like I'm not, I don't, you know, I, I just had that conversation this morning with
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:55.560]   someone.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.080]   I was like, we could use other cameras, but then it'll be a lot more expensive and it won't work as well.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.560]   And so, and I think that lock in becomes big as people start to really build the whole pipeline.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.000]   I think in the past, we really thought of people should specialize and they should do what they
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.280]   do really well.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.960]   But there is something to be said for building a whole ecosystem where everything just works
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.600]   with each other.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:19.720]   Information article, Apple's privacy rules leaves its engineers in the dark.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.920]   This is Wayne Ma in this story.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:29.880]   This is not the first story we've seen saying Apple suffers somewhat in its process because
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.320]   of its need for secrecy.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.520]   I don't think this is even the first time the information.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.360]   Years ago, Craig addressed it.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.080]   Years, years ago, probably 15.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.840]   Go ahead.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.320]   50.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.160]   Go ahead to Alex and then we'll go back.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.360]   I was 15 years.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.280]   I spent a lot of time going to Infinite Loop for different meetings and it slowly became clear to
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.440]   me that I think I knew more about what Apple was doing.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.520]   Years that I was talking to because I was meeting with like six different teams for something
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.760]   and it was like, it was like, I just, I realized that I, they don't talk to each other at all.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.560]   Like, no one in the thing is, is that culturally, they don't want to know.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.440]   Like, they don't want to know stuff that could get them in trouble.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.160]   You know, they don't, you know, what should be secret or not.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.200]   They want to know what they need to know.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.400]   And, but other people's secret things is not something they, they don't ask.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.480]   They don't go into a meeting going, hey, what are you guys working on?
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.280]   Like, no way does that.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:20.280]   There's something to be said for that kind of a collegiality and that sharing of information.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.680]   You learn from one another and you lose something if you don't do that.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.280]   That is a very, very serious issue.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.240]   If they, that is, that is a career limiting offense.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.840]   If you simply know something that you're not supposed to know, no matter how you found out about it,
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.800]   that, that leads to an investigation and then bad things.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.080]   Ma is, it's always hilarious because like before the event, you'll have a bunch of
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.200]   out people and they're like, what are you working on?
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:40.680]   I can't say.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.400]   What are you working on?
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.200]   I can't say.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.400]   Oh, you know, and you all have these black packages all over themselves.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.040]   And then the day after the event, they've all got their new phones out and their new
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.480]   headsets out and their new things out.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.600]   Like, oh, you did that.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.480]   Oh, you did that.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.000]   And, and it's hilarious.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.640]   But like guiding this wrote this famous article a few years ago,
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.080]   where he's like, the supervisor says, why doesn't your new dingus work with black
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.360]   bear? I don't know what black bear is.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.400]   What does it matter with you people?
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.280]   Go over there and find out.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.320]   And the guy's like, I can't tell you.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.760]   And he's like, I can't tell you either.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.600]   And then iOS ships in Syria can't talk to find my friends because nobody could talk to
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.640]   each other at Apple.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.600]   And that affects users.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.280]   Well, but on the, on the other side of it, you know, I worked with, I've worked with a lot of
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:19.800]   big companies and another company, you know, they, there's a lot of free, free flow of information.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.960]   But the problem was, is that people who didn't own that information weren't nearly as careful
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:28.280]   about keeping it secret as the people who, you know, their job depended on it being successful.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.320]   And so that cross pollination while allowing for communication meant that people would just
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.120]   talk to their friends about it.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.680]   Cause it's not their project, you know, and, and they, and so sometimes things leak out.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:43.480]   Things become much more sieve like when everybody's trading that information because the people who
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.760]   are not in that, that division are not as careful as the people that are in the division about
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.840]   keeping it from going to the outside world.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.720]   And so I think that there's a, there's a balancing act there.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.200]   To the former Apple employees, many of whom have also worked at Amazon, Google and Facebook say
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.800]   Apple's privacy restrictions stand apart from those of their peers.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:09.160]   The vanguard of Apple's restrictions is its privacy engineering team, which is made up of
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.200]   several dozen employees and acts as a powerful gatekeeper.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:18.840]   Even junior privacy engineers can veto requests from senior managers at other parts of the company.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.840]   So partly this is so there's two things going on.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:29.000]   There's internal secrecy, but there's also the desire to respect the privacy of your customers.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.240]   And Ma is talking about both of those as being a problem for Apple.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.600]   And we've talked before about how Siri is limited, but it's very different things.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.640]   Craig said, yeah.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.000]   Yeah. Craig said very famously, we don't need to access your camera roll to see what a mountain
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.960]   looks like. We can get a billion photos of mountains off the internet. We're fine.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.120]   But in order to do anything interesting behaviorally, which is what Google and Amazon excel at,
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.280]   they need deep access to your data to, to like, to figure out when you're going to an airport and
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.200]   to warn you ahead of time and to do all of these.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.680]   And Apple is doing very small silos into all those things, but they don't have the big picture.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.960]   And to be in it, like, that's why I think like Siri's not really an assistant, like Siri can be
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:05.880]   helpful. But to be an assistant, they really got to be up in your business the way an assistant is.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.640]   And Apple's put a line in the sand there. And they have been more flexible recently.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.520]   Like they moved some of their inviolate privacy lines because they realized, for example,
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.160]   with health data, which is super sensitive, you might be incapable of handling your own health data.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.920]   And you have like an assistant or a care provider or a family member doing it.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.000]   And they have to make that kind of sharing stuff. And I wish that like, and I know Andy said this
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.080]   for a long time, I wish that I could give Apple permission to access more of my stuff so that I
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.720]   could get better results out of it. I'm not adverse to that bargain at all. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:42.840]   I think we like it that Apple respects our privacy and understand, I think that that
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.080]   hobbles it in some ways. Apple Maps isn't collecting information about everywhere we go,
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.000]   like Google Maps is. They can ask me like informed consent. That's the deep thing was like,
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.480]   ask me again, ask me over again. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:10:01.640]   Like Rene said, it's an interesting balancing act that Apple has to has to maintain. On the one
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.480]   hand, I honestly think that of all the really, really big tech companies, there's nobody that
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:14.840]   I trust lowercase t trust more than Apple with my personal data. So if I could get if I could say,
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:20.040]   if they did, if they did, give me a pop of the said, oh, by the way, if you allow us to collect
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.240]   this information, here's how we can here's how we can improve your experience specifically. And
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.320]   also here are cont here's how you can track what how we're tracking you. Here's how we can turn
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.280]   this off. And by the way, you always we're we're basically leasing this information from you.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.120]   It still belongs to you. I would go for that in heartbeat. But on the other hand, the more that
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.800]   they weaken this idea that no, we are just we are not going to make any money under any
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:48.280]   voice or perform on tracking your personal data under any circumstances. Once they lose that sort
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.960]   of this is the company that you can legitimately trust more than most. That's they they lose something
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.320]   very, very valuable. I mean, Google has to toe that line as well. They also have a board that has
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:04.840]   the power to like, nicks of really, really huge artificial intelligence cloud product,
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.680]   cloud contract, because no, it does not meet our ethical guidelines. No, it does not meet our
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.640]   safety and security guidelines. But the thing is, Google has to make money off of this, and they
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   have to have all this data in order to do all the magic things they want to do. So it really is,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.240]   this is why Apple really couldn't succeed without Google Google couldn't succeed but that Apple.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.200]   So long as people have that choice to make, which deal do you want to make,
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:31.240]   then we're all good. We were locked into one mode, it would be pretty terrible.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:43.080]   Hey, it's Earth Day. Good Earth. Almost the 20, what is it, the 23rd?
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.880]   20 second Earthlings? What up with this? It'll be Earth Day day after tomorrow. No, two days,
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:54.840]   three days, Thursday, two Wednesday, Friday, thank you Friday. Happy days, every day is Earth Day
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:02.760]   on this planet. Apple's launched a new time to walk workout for Apple Fitness Plus with Dr. Jane Goodall.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.720]   Nice. She's so great. You've dealt with her in Rwanda?
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:17.080]   I've dealt with her a bunch of... I met her in Tanzania. We were both at TED.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:24.920]   Incredible memory. My business partner who runs the school in Rwanda, he grew up in Tanzania
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:30.040]   with his father. His father was a researcher and a peer to Jane Goodall. He was the first person
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.960]   ever to be documented being chased by chimpanzees that were going to eat him because he was six
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.120]   years old. It was funny because... Keep running, solve. We're getting great data.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.600]   Because they just noticed it down there. They have this thing where they circle, and that means
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.000]   they're getting ready to eat. Anyway, they obviously scared them off. He's still alive. He's running
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.360]   the school. But the funny thing is, this is like 50 years ago or 40 years ago. I was talking to
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:04.680]   Jane Goodall. I said, "My business partner is a guy named Chris Marlar." She goes, "Oh, I remember
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.960]   his father." And then she goes, "Did he ever tell you what happened with the chimpanzees?"
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.440]   They could have. That was dangerous. She was still upset. She was still upset 40 years later
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:21.240]   about what happened there. It was really sweet. Anyway, so... She's great. It's amazing how much
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:27.800]   energy she just is really. This is her thing. Every time you put her on stage or on a camera,
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.920]   she just lights up and talks about it. Naturally. Really neat.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:38.520]   What else are they doing? There's a new time to run edition that takes... I don't even know about
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.120]   time to run because walking is about as fast as I can. I'm sticking with the walking.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.480]   Yeah, I'm sticking with the walking. Takes listeners to the beautiful sites in Sanzo
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.640]   Yosemite National Park with an uplifting pop and rock playlist.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:14:00.360]   I have time to walk, but for me it's nature. Nature. I listen to the breath. Yeah, that's pretty.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.000]   Apple Fitness Plus users who complete these are any other work out of 30 minutes or more on Earth Day
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.920]   Friday. We'll learn a limited edition award on their Apple Watch. Apple Math is also introducing
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:16.440]   25 new guides to make it easier than ever to find beautiful green spaces, family fun in nature,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.760]   city walks and trails. These are from Lonely Planet All Trails on the Nature Conservancy.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.720]   And on April 22nd, you might want to look for a new immersive, augmented reality experience in
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:35.000]   Snapchat showing the exciting environmental innovations behind iPhone 13. Oh, it's an ad!
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.360]   Okay. I just want to know when Apple is going to send us NFTs for our achievements.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:48.680]   There might as well be. There is, you know, I'm like, right? Here's like a little huge job,
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:53.080]   and I want an NFT out of that. Sure. Then what? That's two of them for $1,000.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:59.640]   Yeah, exactly. Like, Jack's NFT was like what was four million something and now they can sell it
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:09.000]   for $200? Right, right. $2,000, my love, you know. Yeah, I think it was 29 million initially,
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.120]   right? So he's going to lose the guy who bought it. It's going to lose a little bit of money.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:18.840]   But really, NFTs are not about speculation. They're about owning that fine tweet. So enjoy.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:24.680]   And it's about owning a fungible copy of that tweet on one of the block trades to this.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.040]   Well, same thing.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:35.320]   From now through April 22nd, Apple will donate a dollar to the World Wildlife Fund for every
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.120]   purchase made with Apple Pay through the Apple stores, including the online one. So,
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:48.040]   celebrate by buying something from Apple. Yes. Consume. I'm not NFT, NFT, by the way,
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.840]   I'm just anti-grift. If you can come up with something that's amazing with it,
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.360]   I'm all for it, but I just don't like the grift. I just, well, as usual, it's, there's so many
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.960]   things about technology where it's a great idea. It could transform and improve lots of things,
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.000]   but humans get involved and they screw it up. It's like when I first heard about it a couple
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.600]   of years ago, it was all my thoughts were like, there's so, there's so, there's so many fine
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.160]   artists who are working in the digital realm. Like this thing never exists as a physical tangible
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.880]   object. It is, and it has to be an installation if you're going to exhibit it. And if you're going to
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:25.400]   sort of buy it, unquote, it basically is like buying a service and buying a contract to maintain
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.840]   that service. And also all the brilliant things that people are doing in 3D with a 3D brush painting
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.360]   where it's a VR immersive experience. And this is legitimate art. This is a medium that has never
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:42.600]   existed before in a way of human emotion interacting with creativity that we have never had before.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.240]   Not since Bigs for Evolution since then has been the moving picture maybe. And, but how do we get
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.160]   to a point where the people who create these things can get paid for these things in a very,
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:56.440]   very relatable way? So the idea of having, well, we're going to, yes, it's bits and technically
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.520]   speaking, yes, these bits can be copied and duplicated everywhere. But there can be one
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.360]   authoritative owner, the one person who said, I'm going to put skin in this game. I'm going to give
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:10.760]   this art a $60,000 to basically say that I'm the one who owns this thing and has the ability to
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:17.000]   sell it for profit or a loss. That was a very, very, an idea with a lot of potential. But after it
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.840]   became, hey, look, here's a picture of a candy wrapper on my desk, it costs $80,000, and then
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.400]   you get $2 million for it. It's like, okay, they're idiots. They're crypto idiots involved in this.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.080]   They didn't figure out the copyright doesn't transfer yet. I mean, the whole thing is so
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.960]   nascent. Well, the artists have never wanted to sell the copyright, but it's, but as an object that,
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:42.520]   I mean, not that fine art sales are not, isn't a stupid insane market to begin with. I mean,
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:51.160]   look at what got paid for a lot of candy. You know, if you keep this thing parked in a tax-free
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:57.080]   shelter in the warehouse so that it never actually moves anything except for like one piece of data
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:03.000]   from one spray to another. Awesome. But yeah, let's take a little break because I want to
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:12.040]   talk about something with real value, the thousands of domain names that I own on hover.com. That
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:18.760]   is the place I go to to buy domain names. Some of them silly, some of them important like twit.tv,
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:27.720]   like leoloport.com. Hover is the place to get domain names. And if you're in a business and you
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:34.040]   don't own your own domain name, if your mail is still going to hotmail.com or gmail.com,
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:40.520]   you need to go to hover.com right now and get a domain name or email address. That's yours. It's
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:46.280]   just for you, whether you're a blogger, an artist creating a portfolio, building your NFT store,
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:51.400]   just want to make some more memorable redirects to your resume on LinkedIn,
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:56.520]   you've got to go to hover.com. Let's start with email. It's your key to connecting with
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.520]   customers and building trust for your brand. But how are they going to trust you if it's my
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:08.600]   great widgets at gmail.com? Instead of leo@mygreatwidgets.com. Easy to set up at hover. They've got domain-based
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.800]   emails for all your needs, small or large. You could set up as many mailboxes to you domain as
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.440]   you need. It's nice. It's convenient because when your domain renews, your mailboxes do too.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:23.400]   The prices are great. You should check out the prices. They're most popular mailbox.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.280]   It's just a no-brainer solution for business owners. Plus, it's email. They've got a web mail
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.240]   solution, but you can use your existing email client as well. It's real email. Hover isn't
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.800]   here to upsell you on stuff you don't need either. I love that. If you've ever registered a domain
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:44.360]   anywhere else, you know there's page after page of upsell. Not hover. The tools are great pro-level
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.600]   tools. If you are good with DNS, you'll love their domain name management system. Very powerful.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.400]   Same with their email tools. They're intuitive and easy to use whether you're a web pro or just
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:01.480]   getting started. They offer who is privacy protection, not as an add-on, but with every single domain
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:07.960]   purchase so that your private information remains just that private. Hover Connect, if you don't want
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:13.880]   to do DNS, is a great way to connect your domain to your website with just a couple of clicks.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:19.480]   Connect is amazing. Hover, you're a customer, not a source of data. Take back control of your data
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:25.080]   with reliable tracker-free email. Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:31.160]   who use their domain names and email to turn their ideas into reality. We're going to get you 10
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.560]   percent off your first purchase on any domain extension for the entire first year right now.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:43.000]   If you go to hover.com/twit, whether you're a developer, a photographer, a small business,
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:53.160]   hover has something for you to expand your projects and get the visibility you want. Hover.com/twit,
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:21:00.360]   10 percent off your first purchase of any domain extension for the entire first year. Hover.com/twit
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.400]   for 10 percent off. We thank Hover so much for their support.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.120]   Of Mac Break Weekly, you support us when you use that address, please do.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.960]   We love you, Hover.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:15.080]   If you are going to steal some of these AirPods,
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:28.440]   this is a great story. This is a post from Instagram from Vitaly Seminets. He is a Ukrainian man
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:34.040]   whose AirPods were stolen by retreating Russian forces who looted his home.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:40.120]   He tracked them all the way back from his home in Gostumel into Russia.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:47.320]   He knows where his AirPods are. I'm not sure he should go. I wouldn't recommend going to get them.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.600]   Apparently, it shows the actual movement of Russian forces as they retreat
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:58.040]   from an initial plan to attack Kyiv. They cross the border into Belarus, eventually reached Belograd.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:04.120]   Where they are amassing troops for an assault, apparently, for the eastern region of the Donbas.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:13.000]   28,000 likes on his Instagram. By the way, a number of requests that Apple gave him new AirPods.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:20.040]   Seminets writes in Ukrainian on his Instagram, "Thanks to technology. I know where my AirPods are now."
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.080]   Requests for Apple to send them like a hundred and just leave them scattered.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.560]   Yeah, throughout the weather.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.000]   Wow, find my AirPods.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.760]   You return my AirPods now. They'll be the end of it. But if you don't, I will look for them.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.160]   Wow.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:42.920]   And there is a long article in R's Technica by Dan Gooden, who's their security guy, about
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:50.600]   how people are getting around ATT, the application protection, privacy protection.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:59.960]   Without, of course, the IDFA. And by the way, Facebook says we lost 10 billion this year.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.840]   We're going to lose even more next year, thanks to ATT.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.200]   There was an update on that. I saw a really good update on that. And they were saying that
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.360]   originally that was the thought because people stopped being able to see the direct result of
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.840]   their ad spend in Facebook and Instagram. So they lowered their ad spend and then they started
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:19.880]   selling fewer products. So they up their ad spend again. And they realized that because of these
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:23.560]   new guidelines, they just weren't seeing it in Facebook and Instagram. They were seeing it in
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.640]   their own coffers. So what they did was like, they're still spending the money. It's just
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.400]   Facebook isn't getting all the data anymore. They're actually getting it. So they're resuming
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.440]   their spending. It was an interesting adjustment period.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:39.400]   It was an interesting, this is a quoting and interesting research paper that says that while
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   ATT works in many ways, as intended loopholes in the framework, also provide opportunity for
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.800]   companies, particularly large ones like Google and Facebook to work around the protections and
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:55.560]   stockpile. Even more data. We've said this before. First party data collection is even better.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.960]   Overall, our observations suggest the paper says, while Apple's changes make tracking
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:05.800]   individual users more difficult, they motivate a counter movement and reinforce existing market
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.640]   power of gatekeeper companies with access to large troves of first party.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.840]   And if you're using Chrome, I mean, Google knows what you're doing. There's no ATT.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.120]   Yeah. I'm protecting against Chrome.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:20.840]   Well, that's what Google said at the time that they don't anticipate having, and basically,
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.000]   they're affecting their bottom line. Facebook had to make that disclosure because it was
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.600]   affecting their business and they had to mention that to stockholders. As you said,
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.960]   the difference between Facebook and most of their data through a Facebook app,
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.480]   over which Apple can have extreme tight control versus Google getting most of their data through
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:45.560]   the browser that is the primary browser choice for what is it? 67, 68 percent of the world's
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:52.520]   browsing. And they actually also create exactly. So Google way smarter than Facebook. We've determined
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:57.480]   that. Well, I think that also that what we're seeing is Apple, we've talked about this before,
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.880]   but they're slowly pointing that net. And if you pull it into much, then everyone complains about
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.520]   it. And it doesn't seem defendable. But especially, it's very hard to say that you shouldn't allow
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.600]   users to decide whether they want to be tracked. So that's a very hard to defend situation. And
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.680]   so Apple has started with that. And as they just keep on, oh, we noticed that there were some
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.920]   loopholes and the users would like to see something more and we'll just close that door too. But
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.600]   doing it just behind the users is better than getting smarter ahead of them.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.280]   Yeah, that's one thing the researchers point out, for instance, they identified nine iOS apps,
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:32.920]   which use server-side code to generate a mutual user identifier, not Apple's, but another one
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.240]   that Alibaba can use for cross app tracking that technically violates Apple's policy,
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:45.000]   but Apple isn't necessarily enforcing it. And also more people are opting in if I read that right
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.520]   because they're making a better case for why interesting and some of the stuff is actually
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.200]   useful. So the numbers have gone up like several percentage points over the last year.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.840]   That's interesting, which is what we want, right? Like we formed consent. Yeah, informed consent.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:02.520]   Also, Apple does have to be careful there. If they wanted to, they could really lock down
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.120]   the iPhone so that you are as invisible as you want to be. But the moment that they make it
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:14.040]   impossible for anybody to make anybody to make any money whatsoever off of a product
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:18.760]   app or service that doesn't simply charge you $50 to $60 per use of the app,
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:25.240]   that's when Facebook says, "Okay, this is not sustainable, so guess what? We're not going to
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.640]   allow the Facebook app. We're pulling the Facebook app from the Apple store. If people want to use
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.080]   Facebook through the iPhone, they're going to have to use a web browser." And then there'll be so
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.960]   many complaints from Instagram users, WhatsApp users, all those other users that they would have
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:43.640]   to pull back. But I don't even think that Apple wants to be that draconian. There are simple things
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:50.280]   they can do that are just hard to argue against if your company pretends to care about user privacy
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.440]   and choice. And so they're doing those things good for them. And it's just hard. It's not as
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:58.440]   popular to legislate against as well. I mean, you have a lot of folks that are already trying to
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.000]   get legislation done. And when you look at it on the face, it's like, "Oh, that's going to be hard one
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.240]   to regulate," is giving people access to just giving them a button to push. So I think if Apple
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.120]   keeps on taking that path in that area, it might be hard to push them out.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:21.240]   Renee, you were referring to a company called Adjust, a research firm. When ATT,
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:29.080]   App Tracking Transparency first came out, we said about 4% of users opted in. Almost everybody said,
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:36.760]   "No," according to Adjust, it may of last year, Optin rates around 16%. Now that number
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:42.600]   a year later is 25%. And it really does very much depend on the app. When it comes to games,
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:51.560]   it's 30%. This is global research considering the 2000 most popular apps in Adjust's database.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.680]   In some cases, popular games have achieved Optin rates of up to 75%.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.880]   There was a big shock too. I remember when Apple turned in Bluetooth tracking,
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.800]   and suddenly we saw all the apps that were taking Bluetooth with no reason to. And when
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.720]   they turned on App Tracking Transparency, it's like every TV show app I had suddenly started
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.640]   going, "Can we try tracking?" I'm like, "No, I'm watching the Simpsons. You're tracking me."
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.800]   It was just a big shock as to everyone who was pulling all that data. Now we have some control
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.160]   over it. So we're assigning it to the apps that make sense. And we're not to the apps that we're
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.960]   just using it to get data to sell for their own purposes.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:26.280]   I'm guessing that the games that people say yes to are probably offering you something for that.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.000]   Free levels if you watch out.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.960]   That kind of thing. And if people are making that conscious choice, that's fine.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:42.200]   We've talked about the fact that Apple, in its fight with Epic, is also locking out Unreal Engine.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.720]   But there is a new game creation tool called Core that is moving to iOS and Mac this summer.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.240]   It has been on PC. And it lets you build games on Unreal Engine.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:29:02.920]   So that's kind of interesting. I guess that's a way to... It's from Manticore Games.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.000]   There's other ways to build games, too, with Unity.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.240]   So I think it's going to be interesting to see how that works.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:17.560]   Did we notice that Apple was super happy to get out in front and give a signed personal
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.040]   statement about Facebook's revenue share? No, what do they say?
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:29.800]   Criteria. So Facebook originally said it is userious that Apple is asking for this
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.920]   high 30% commission. It's going to put people out of jobs out of business.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.840]   It's terrible, bad for the economy. It's making puppies cry and trees burn.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.360]   And then they said, when we come out with ours, it's going to be fair. It's going to promote
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:45.000]   all of this activity. It's going to be great for developers. It turns out they put out a double
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.920]   tax on it. So you've got to pay like 30% plus 25%. So it ends up being something around over 50%
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.120]   and Apple's Fred Sains, who's a wonderful, wonderful gentleman, just said, it's a little bit
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:00.520]   hypocritical for Facebook to come out. I think Tim Cook may have said something as well.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:06.760]   So you get the standard 30% on the Metacuests store. But then if you're going to use it in
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:14.120]   Horizon Worlds, you're going to get an additional 17.5%. That's 47.5%. And then you add the credit
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:20.040]   card fee, which they don't cover. And yeah, you're well over 50%. And their base is the same as
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:27.000]   Apple's, which they were up in arms about. Yeah. Well, yeah, world is funny. What a surprise, right?
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.480]   I feel like... Who could have thought it? Who would have thought Facebook would have done that?
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:38.520]   Apple apparently, they got Friday night baseball.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:44.200]   Still, the jury's still out on whether they've got a decent announced team, but they got baseball
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:51.240]   on Friday nights. They wanted the NFL Sunday ticket, which currently DirectTV has. And I'm seeing
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:57.960]   a number of people saying it's already a done deal, but Apple doesn't want anybody to announce it yet.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.680]   There's no way that DirectTV can compete with Apple. No, yes.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:09.160]   Contract. Yeah. They were paying one and a half billion a year to the NFL. One and a half billion
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:15.160]   a year for Sunday ticket. Apple, of course, can come in. One eighth of Apple's Google money.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:21.000]   Right. They can come in. Exactly. The expectation is around two and a half billion is going to be the
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.680]   selling price, which means... And the ticket wasn't an exclusive. It's not taking games away from
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.080]   yours anywhere. It is making sure that I think if you have the ticket, you can watch any game from,
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:38.120]   you can see any game inside of... Except your local one, right? They still have the markets,
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:43.880]   blackouts. Yeah. But if you can see them, the problem with the networks is you can barely,
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:48.680]   you just have to guess whether your team is going to be on that, if you don't have the NFL
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:53.080]   ticket. And then even the NFL ticket takes it away. So the big thing with DirectTV was that you could
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:57.640]   except for your local market, you could see anything that was out there. And so that was a lot.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:03.000]   That was a big advantage of being able to kind of tune in to anything. Verizon had something like
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.320]   that as well. So it wasn't completely exclusive. So it's not taking games away from people who would
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:12.200]   have them any other way except for DirectTV. Like people who have DirectTV is going to take it away
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.840]   from them. So that's the place that it'll be a big change because it's been around for.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.640]   Well, and it was a huge selling point. I remember when we were looking at the very
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.880]   satellite providers, there was no question, if you like NFL football, you get DirectTV.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:28.840]   Right. I mean, there was just no question. They had... That's the one you had to get.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:33.160]   So I have a feeling that's not going to be very good.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:44.600]   So Amazon, Disney, Comcast, Paramount, all apparently in the bidding, but it's hard to outbid Apple
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.800]   on something like that. If they wanted. If they wanted. But Disney could have had Mickey in the
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:58.680]   calling the game. Oh, it's a touchdown. Oh, and Disney already has ABC and ESPN and
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.360]   a lot of other things. So Disney's already got a lot of sports that they, you know,
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:08.520]   actually not far off. Didn't Nickelodeon have the NFL play by play in the playoffs?
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:13.240]   Nickelodeon version of it to get kids live in the players.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:20.120]   Into football. Yes, they did. But not for... It was animated slime, I think.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.600]   It wasn't... Players were a little busy doing something else, but...
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:28.200]   Last thing we needed is for Disney to take over like football right here in the game.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.160]   It'd be like the third quarter would be like a soccer game that they also own from someplace else.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.360]   And then you have to watch a soccer game. No, it would be a hard one.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:43.160]   Yeah. It would be Kingdom Hearts. NFL has reportedly wanted Sunnytake to go to Apple for a few months now.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.440]   There are... Apples apparently planning to spend billions on live sports over the next four years
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:53.480]   for its Apple TV Plus. It is definitely a driver. I mean, there's no question having live sports is
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.160]   a huge thing, especially in this era of court cutting. So good for Apple on this one.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:06.120]   I hope they... I wonder... I mean, I imagine MLB and NFL have some say in how it's produced,
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.760]   but as we've said with the baseball, we'd love to see some innovation here.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.120]   Shouldn't they be getting like a cricket world championships and some Manchester United in there?
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:19.800]   No, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Cricket is just absolutely huge. And also,
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:25.000]   unlike sports like baseball, cricket recently basically looked at all the complaints
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.080]   that people were making about baseball that were maybe made about their own events,
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.720]   that it's too long. There's not enough movement. They created essentially a version of Speed Cricket
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.000]   that absolutely revolutionized cricket. Speed is cricket sport.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.920]   Yeah, no, it's... It's not actually more out of it. It turns it from like a three-day test match to
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.200]   no, you've got only a certain number of hours, you have a certain number of goals, you have to...
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.440]   It's not like I won't say I got hooked on it, but once you start watching some of these matches,
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:00.520]   especially like really, really deep rivalries, the fans are more insane than any place else
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:09.640]   without being violent. The players are like as... It's an amazing thing that no American
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.760]   broadcaster has said, "You know what? We could probably get this pretty cheap and it is very,
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.960]   very exciting and this would be a crit." And we'd also bring in a lot of subscribers that we
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.240]   won't be able to access otherwise. All that expat money.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.200]   I think the thing is that the direction, though, in my opinion, the great thing about baseball is
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.320]   the conversation that you can have around it and the fact that they do a little bit of that,
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:37.960]   but they show little data and they have so many, so few things that I think that there's a huge
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:43.400]   opportunity in baseball to vastly increase it, not by making it faster, but by making it
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.000]   just adding more detail between the designer... Did you tell us, Dred Alex?
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.720]   We were... The problem was we were illustrating basketball games, professional basketball games,
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.360]   and we were illustrating the problem is the game keeps going all the time. It's like always going
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.240]   all the time. You can't draw on for anything. That's the best part of football is that everything
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:04.760]   stops all the time. So you can sit there and go, "Okay, this is what happened and this is how you know
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.240]   it and that's part of what makes football and baseball so interesting." But people have never
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.520]   really taken advantage of it with baseball, but they definitely take advantage of it in football.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.880]   I mean, if you look at a lot of the... All that illustration and all the... I mean,
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:22.680]   and it's... If you really watch like Sunday Night Football, it is an amazing amount of data that they
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:28.200]   are passing to you about the game. You know, about... Like all those replays that are happening. When
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.840]   you think about the game, the play just ended, now we're going to give you a cogent conversation
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.920]   for 25 seconds about what just happened and set you up for the next one. And then we're going to
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.240]   do that like 300 times. It's just an amazing thing. It really is an amazing coverage and hopefully
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.480]   Apple. I mean, there's definitely places to innovate, but the NFL spends so much time and money
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.120]   innovating on their game. Well, I've seen people say, and I wonder if this eventually won't be the
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:55.960]   case that the NFL eventually should just take all the games and make you subscribe to NFL+
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:03.080]   and just do it that way. That's a big risk. That was huge because the thing is golf can pull
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:07.080]   something like that because their advertisers are basically selling like... They're selling
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:14.360]   80,000 cars. Most majorly sports, however, you're selling to everybody. And if you basically suddenly
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.560]   say that the only people that are allowed to watch this sport are the people who can afford
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.320]   an extra subscription and also the hardware that's required and the broadband connection that's
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.600]   required, now you're really limiting your advertising base. And that's how you drive people to gaming.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.680]   That's how you drive people to something else. They're going to find someplace else to spend
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.320]   their money and it's just not going to be basketball. It's not going to be football.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.680]   The other issue is the NFL already has... You don't need an internet connection. It already has.
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.000]   It's on cable. It's on satellite. There's an NFL network. But the problem is you can only cover
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.920]   one game at a time and there's a whole bunch of games going on. So you might as well spread it out
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:55.320]   so that you can get and make money at it. It takes so much risk away when somebody else takes the risk.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.560]   That's a very good point. Yeah.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.960]   By the way, it's not called Speed Cricket. It's called T20 or 2020.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.160]   2020 Cricket. There we go.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:13.720]   Go on YouTube and basically Google T20 or 2020 and it won't turn you into an absolute devotee.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.680]   But you'll click through for a lot of other videos when it's like... It basically is like
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:24.280]   it's three hours. It's only 20 overs. It's like... So basically, no screwing around. You're going to
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.880]   have to bowl. You're going to have to hit. You're going to have to run. It's a much more...
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.760]   Like I said, I would love to see someone try to do that with baseball. I think there's anything
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:37.640]   wrong with the existing baseball. But some way to say that, look, here's a way we're going to make
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:42.440]   it... We're not going to change Major League Baseball. We're going to create T20 baseball where
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:47.160]   it's 90 minutes and here are ways to make sure that it's all about base running. It's all about
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:53.800]   hitting. It's no longer necessarily a 20-minute pitchers duel between a single at bat.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.640]   I think that's great. But I would love to see what would happen if it's like there's nobody above
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:04.600]   the age of 23 will possibly be in any kind of shape to play T20 Major League Baseball.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:11.080]   That's why I like baseball. You can be a fat old guy and still hit a home run.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.200]   48-year-old pitcher starting pitcher was throwing 93 mile an hour fastballs on opening day.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:21.960]   Love that. Get ready, Renee, because Niantic has a new game.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.400]   It's basically... It looks like Pokemon without the licensing...
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.200]   Licensing phase.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.200]   Yes. Sorry.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.160]   Or Harry Potter.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:37.880]   It's not Harry Potter. It's Peridot. Explore the world with adorable virtual pets.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:43.800]   Will you care for? You adventure together on daily walks. You satisfy your creature's desires.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:48.120]   Well, that doesn't sound like fun. Uncover hidden treasures around the world here.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:52.520]   Let's watch it. It's a... It's AR. It's going to be on the iPhone. It's not out yet.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.120]   See you're a little...
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.560]   A little crossover with Ingress.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.160]   Little virtual pets with you.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.360]   I thought this might do well.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.120]   I don't know.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.000]   Yes, Tomi-Kachi.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.120]   Yeah, I guess with some Pokemon elements because you got to get out there and do things, I think.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:16.920]   And it's funny because there's a big controversy right now in the Pokemon community
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.080]   because they're trying to force people to go outside again.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.760]   And in some places it's still not safe.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.320]   But it turns out they're trying to build a walks travel map network.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.720]   And they need us to go out there and collect all the data for them.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.880]   Oh, so it's super inconvenient that we're about to talk to them.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:30.680]   We need you to get out there.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.360]   Get out there and walk.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.760]   Yeah, Lisa gets angry because they've...
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.040]   You know, all of the things they added to make it easy to play at home when COVID,
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.080]   they're starting to take out.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.960]   And it's like, now you've got to really play again.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.080]   Alert.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.280]   That's what happens on that.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:52.280]   There's a nine star Charizard at the closest donut shop that is open that is handicapped accessible.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.080]   Go and find it.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.760]   Pretty much.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.040]   That's pretty much the story.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.640]   Right there.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.160]   All right.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:03.000]   I think we should get our picks of the week ready.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.240]   But I'll just before we let this go, it's really bizarre.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:08.520]   Like, now a lot of the polka stops, you have this special disc on, you press it,
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.840]   and you get extra stuff for taking your camera out,
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.480]   walking around it and collecting complete AR, like 3D imagery for them.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.640]   Oh, this. And you're just getting a couple extra polka balls for it.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.680]   It's ingenious.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.640]   It's evil genius.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.000]   Yes.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:23.880]   Apple's paying people.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:24.520]   Do you still play?
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.120]   I think Lisa said, "Oh, Renee's in a bad raid with me, I think, the other day."
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:28.920]   You still play?
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:28.920]   Yes.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:30.520]   I don't play.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:33.800]   Like, they're starting to really like bother me with some of the same changes they're making.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.600]   That's bothering Lisa.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.560]   So I don't play as often anymore, but it's still like when I have time I do.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.320]   It was...
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:39.960]   I have to say...
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:47.640]   We played pretty hard, as you know, starting in July 2016 when it came out and walked a lot of miles.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.240]   And it was fun.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.200]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.040]   I'm always amazed at how fickle...
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.880]   How fickle an audience will be and how dangerous it is to change things.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:58.200]   Yes.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.000]   Because it's just like, you know, like someone changed one little thing.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:07.400]   And, you know, like I bought all my clothes from Eddie Bauer because there's one in the Roland Plaza in Nevada.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.160]   I mean, I just had lots of them, and then they closed it.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.440]   They moved to the Petaluma, and now I went to somewhere else.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.960]   Like I was like, "Oh, fuck the killer shows."
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.320]   It was like, "Yeah, too far away."
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.200]   Yeah, it does.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:16.680]   But it's...
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.800]   But you have to be very careful.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.640]   And I just noticed how many products that I'll...
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:23.000]   They'll change one weird little thing, and then I just stop using it.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.360]   I'm not going to use this anymore.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.280]   Well, I probably shouldn't tell you then that we've added annual subscriptions to Club Twit.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:28.920]   That might...
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.960]   No, that's awesome.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.560]   ...scotch the whole thing.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:31.960]   That's good.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:32.520]   So, but that's good.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:32.920]   That's good.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.640]   That's win-win.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:34.760]   It's when it feels like it's in...
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.360]   An inequitable change.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.080]   Look, we feel like you're changing for your benefit and not mine that people get upset.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.680]   So, you're not confident that you can basically get people...
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.680]   Keep people engaged on a month-by-month basis.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.560]   Look forward to that, isn't it?
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:46.200]   No, no, no, no.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.960]   You know, the funny thing, and this will be the controversial thing.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.480]   So, it's seven bucks a month.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:54.040]   I had free versions of all of our shows,
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.880]   Access to Our Really Fun Discord,
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.720]   where there's all sorts of interesting things going on,
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:01.000]   like the Untitled Linux Show Stasis book club.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.440]   Jeff Jarvis did an AMA last week, things like that.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.680]   And of course, the Twipless Feed, which has all sorts of interesting stuff.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.280]   We've had a corporate plan for a while.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.080]   That's done pretty well.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:15.960]   That's $6 a month for up to from five to as many seats as you want.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:18.440]   But people kept saying, "But I just want to pay once.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.320]   I don't want to pay monthly."
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.280]   And so, I think they thought maybe we'd give them a discount,
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.840]   but no, we're just going to say it's $84 for a year
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.480]   and see what happens.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.880]   Because it's still, I think, a very good deal.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.200]   But if you just want to pay once a year,
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.000]   or, and this is actually, this is what put us over the top,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.240]   if you want to buy it as a gift,
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.520]   seven bucks is not a great gift.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.120]   But you can buy the $84 a year, and that would be a better gift.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.200]   So, twit.tv, please.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.640]   Don't all quit the club at once.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.880]   Twit.tv/club to it.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:51.320]   It really does help us.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.960]   And honestly, it takes us a little way towards our goal of kind of
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:01.080]   ad-free forever, which that was the dream in the very beginning.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.960]   Didn't seem doable.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.160]   And we love our advertisers.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.440]   We're very careful on how we pick them.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.400]   So, it's not so bad.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.240]   But, you know, especially as time goes by,
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.200]   be nice to just with Spotify eating the world,
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:17.160]   to have another source of revenue that is not an advertiser.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.440]   So, that's why we started Club Twit.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:24.440]   And you help us a lot if you join a twit.tv/club twit.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.360]   Now, speaking of advertisers, I'm fond of.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.240]   This is a great Earth Day advertiser.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:32.840]   Blue land, you know that an estimated 5 billion
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:38.600]   plastic, hand soap, and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year, 5 billion.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.960]   And if that weren't bad enough,
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.960]   most of the stuff in the cleaning bottle is water, 90% water.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.520]   So, you're paying a lot of money to transport water around in trucks.
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:51.560]   Bad for your pocketbook,
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.560]   Blue Land is the solution.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:45:01.400]   Blue Land is designed to be, you buy these forever bottles for 10 bucks.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:05.400]   When you buy a kit, and it's designed to be reused forever
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.920]   with money-saving refill tablets that started just $2.00.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.920]   On Twit, on Sunday, I made some hand soap.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.400]   I should fill this with water.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.280]   I could fill this with water.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.880]   This is the multi-surface cleaner.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.920]   These are the tablets.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:22.840]   So, once you get the bottle, and by the way, I have these throughout our house,
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.280]   in fact, it's a great housewarming gift.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.360]   I gave it to my daughter for her new apartment.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.600]   Once you have these in the house,
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:32.280]   and they have a replenishment service, if you want to subscribe,
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.880]   otherwise you can order as needed.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.760]   You just put your water in these plastic bottles, you never throw out.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.240]   Actually, the hand soap comes in these beautiful heavy glass bottles
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.640]   because it needs to be heavy because you're going squirt it.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.920]   I just think this is great.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.920]   Blue Land was founded on the belief,
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.960]   a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.120]   But, and I know you're thinking this, I don't want to make a sacrifice
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.560]   for the planet in effective cleaners.
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.760]   No, these are really great, powerful, effective cleaners.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.560]   In some cases, I think you're going to prefer these
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.320]   to the expensive wasteful plastic bottles you're buying.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.400]   In many cases, people really love the toilet tablet cleaner,
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.680]   which you put in the toilet tablet.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.280]   You put in the, it cleans the toilet.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.280]   You use the brush and walk away, finish your cleaning, and then you're done.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:20.200]   We use it in the laundry.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:24.440]   They have also an oxy cleaner that gives you bleach-like cleaning.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:28.840]   They have a, that's the dishwashing soap, a powdered dishwashing soap,
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.960]   does a great job.
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.040]   I would say, are you better than the liquid dishwashing soaps?
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.400]   I just love it.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.160]   I just love it.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:43.000]   Blue Land, buy the bottle once, refill it forever, no more plastic waste.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.440]   The only thing you have to throw out, your outdated idea that eco-friendly products
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.600]   are more expensive and less effective.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.240]   Just read the reviews at the site and you'll see.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.400]   And by the way, the scents they have are fantastic.
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:58.280]   Now, we actually don't, at least it doesn't like scents,
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:01.960]   so we use the unscented laundry stuff, but if you like scents,
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.760]   iris agave, perein lemon, lavender eucalyptus, they're very light.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.960]   They're very light.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.320]   They're not overpowering.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.160]   And they have special scents every once in a while,
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.360]   just ordered a new set of seasonal scents,
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.560]   which is kind of fun on your hand soap when you, your hands,
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.920]   oh, that smells good.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.240]   Just try Blue Land.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.120]   You will love it.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.240]   The planet will thank you.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:28.440]   Your pocketbook will thank you as little as $2 for the refill tablets.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.600]   Right now, 20% off your first order.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:36.760]   Just go to Blue Land, belleland.com/macbreak.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.360]   This is just to me, just makes so much sense.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.320]   Blueland.com/macbreak.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.280]   We have Blue Land cleaners throughout our house.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.160]   I just wanted to show you, I should have, I should have,
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.320]   this is my, I call this my chemistry set.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.520]   I should have actually made this.
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.200]   I'll next time I'll make it.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.240]   But you just put, you put warm water in there, up to the line.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.720]   You put the tablet in there, you can fizzes.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.200]   You've got the greatest cleaners ever.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.880]   Save 20% off your first order when you go to Blue Land.com/macbreak.
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:09.560]   Thank you, Blue Land, for your support
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:12.600]   and for the good work you're doing for the planet.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:15.960]   This would be a good Earth Day purchase.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.920]   Honey, we're going green.
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.080]   88, 88, ask Leo the...
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.680]   I don't know why I said that.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:29.640]   That's the phone number, but don't call it,
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.160]   because there's nobody there, over there.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.320]   I'm seeing, I just saw it, but I'll say it.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:38.040]   I'm on automatic, John.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:43.960]   Let's start our picks of the week with Rene Ritchie.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.360]   I have an interesting one this week.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.080]   So, I haven't seen The Batman yet, so please, no spoilers.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.560]   It's just coming out now, so I'm going to watch it sometime this week.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.800]   It's on HBO Max now, if you subscribe.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.200]   Yes.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:54.760]   Lisa and I watch.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.640]   Well, Craig and Canada.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:01.080]   We watched it last night on the OLED 4K 70-inch screen.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:03.240]   The sera... it sounded great, looked great.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.440]   It's a beautiful movie.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.480]   Really is.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:06.520]   So, that's the whole thing.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.320]   There's a YouTuber, Patrick Tomasso, who's a photographer,
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.240]   and he went through, and he's just talking about the look they did for this movie,
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.360]   because they did a lot of things.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.160]   They got RE to make them a set of custom lenses
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:20.200]   that deliberately destroyed the normal focal position of those lenses.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.400]   Oh, interesting.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:21.480]   So, what happened?
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:21.880]   Interesting.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:23.560]   Interesting things in and out of focus.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.280]   And it would sort of pull your eye in different directions.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.400]   And then they also...
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.120]   Like, they filmed it digitally on the RE cameras,
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.880]   but then they scanned it into film.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.600]   They processed it that way, then scanned it in again.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.600]   I forget the name of it, but it's like an orange emulsion stage of filming.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.280]   Then, re-scanded back into digital,
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.800]   so they get the exact sort of film color profiles they want.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.640]   And they went out of their way to dirty things up.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.600]   So, there is a lot of blur, there is a lot of depth of field,
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.840]   there's things in the foreground and the background.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.520]   There's a lot of off-angle shots or shots when you're looking through something.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.880]   And everything from the color grade,
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.600]   it's...
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:59.560]   They were sort of saying, he's the same cinematographer who did Dune.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:00.760]   He's just very, very talented.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.960]   Oh, Dune's amazing.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:04.200]   By the way...
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:04.840]   It's so gorgeous.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.160]   But I hope this isn't a spoiler.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.200]   But the penguin...
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.520]   That's Colin Farrell.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.440]   It's so ridiculous.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.840]   The credits, I'm saying, "Con Farrell was in this movie."
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:20.680]   With a...
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.600]   This is the new thing now, if you're an actor.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:26.840]   You got to do the prosthetics and the heavy makeup.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.880]   Yeah, you got to ugly yourself.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.000]   You got to ugly yourself up.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.440]   Yeah, I'm going to see if I can find a shot.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.880]   It doesn't look like Colin Farrell.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:33.480]   So many act...
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:36.920]   So many movies are so sterile and so pretty and so perfect.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:37.480]   Oh, this is not...
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.880]   This is a complete repudiation of all of that.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.600]   And like Patrick, I really hope it leads to some
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.280]   to a lot more interesting ways of making these big budget movies.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.120]   Because you don't have to be digitally perfect.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.000]   We're way beyond just pure green screen and warehouses.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.960]   There's so many interesting things we can do both digitally and optically.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.400]   And I hope this starts to send...
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.040]   This end-use starts to reset that trend.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.360]   That's something I find so annoying.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:03.720]   I enjoy death on the Nile when I watched it last week.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.360]   But it was that to an extreme where...
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:09.000]   Real life and real photography...
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:14.120]   You don't have complete HDR, like Instagram style imagery,
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.320]   frame by frame by frame.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:17.480]   I was... I compared it to...
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:18.920]   I watched the...
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:23.960]   the ITV, the British TV version of the exact same story.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:24.920]   And it's like...
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:28.520]   I kind of enjoy the TV version more because when the boat is going...
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:31.960]   It's a beautiful shot of this boat going up the river.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.080]   But the thing is the sky...
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:35.080]   It's okay for the sky to be gray.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.280]   It's okay for the bright spots and dark spots in it.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.640]   It's okay for the camera not to be in exactly the right position
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.520]   to catch this bird that happened to be flying away.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:45.400]   It's like that's why...
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:48.440]   That was why it felt like a video game watching this modern movie.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.240]   And this is one of the reasons why a lot of modern action movies
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:54.440]   kind of don't do it for me because everyone's concerned about,
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.040]   "Well, if we're gonna do the sky digitally,
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:57.160]   I want three...
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.080]   No, make it four seagulls.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:02.680]   No, make it mockingbirds flying in this formation."
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:05.560]   And they land on this thing and there's nothing that's random.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.480]   And there's nothing that isn't like so choreographed.
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.880]   In this they put silicon on the lens
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.560]   so that the rain would hit it and stay on it.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.520]   It wouldn't get cleaned off.
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:13.720]   There's so much rain in this movie.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:14.840]   It is the West movie.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.080]   Even though Christopher Nolan's Gotham,
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.240]   which is Chicago, it looks like Chicago and this Gotham,
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.520]   which doesn't look like any city.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.680]   Oh, by the way, the art direction is...
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.600]   You will love how Gotham looks.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.640]   The art direction in this is spectacular,
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.760]   especially with the cities.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:29.560]   I can't wait to see it.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:30.120]   Just gorgeous.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.200]   They're making a real movie.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.400]   They weren't making an event.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.760]   That's what I want.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:37.000]   It's funny that you should mention the death on the line
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.120]   because I went back and watched the 1978 Peter Eustinov death in the Nile.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.560]   It was so much better for one reason.
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:44.920]   It was actually shot in Egypt.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.560]   And I recognized this place.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:48.440]   It's real.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:49.640]   And you could tell it's not that...
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:51.880]   It was cheesy CGI in the...
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:54.680]   I haven't seen death of the Nile.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.640]   I've only seen bits and pieces that a couple of us have been talking about.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.880]   And the effects look so bad.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.760]   They're so terrible.
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.160]   That's part of it.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.720]   It just looks like they really just ran out of money or something.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:05.480]   A lot of it is simply...
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.560]   I'll cut myself off after really...
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.600]   I've got the shot clock on.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.240]   Don't worry about it.
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:10.200]   But it's like...
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:14.440]   I wish that every director would get the one memo that says that
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:17.000]   not everything has to be a drone shot.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.320]   And I know that you can make the camera start at the bottom
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.040]   and then track all the way up as you go past this monument.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.240]   It's okay to put the camera on a tripod, lock it down,
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:28.200]   get your establishing shot, and then cut to some place closer.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:28.920]   Because that was...
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.840]   That's things to kind of bug me.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.840]   I was watching a TV show.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.880]   I can't remember what it was.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.240]   But they were using tripods.
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:37.160]   I can tell.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:40.280]   The shots were perfect and static.
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.360]   And we have gone so far beyond that.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:43.960]   Nobody does that anymore.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:47.240]   So when you see it, it's like, wow, that's very old fashioned.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.840]   A steady shot.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:52.920]   I think the Matrix kind of just cracked the whole window.
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.200]   And then everyone just flew through it.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:55.320]   Now we're finding our way back.
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.400]   The Matrix was so far out there.
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:59.080]   That it changed how we made films.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:01.800]   They didn't realize that people don't realize that the reason
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:06.520]   why the Matrix did it that way is because that's consistent with the story.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.040]   That they are not in a real place.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.680]   This is in a simulation where that kind of stuff can be doing.
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:11.400]   Then we wind up in...
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.880]   I haven't seen the sequel to...
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.440]   Oh god, I can't remember the name.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:20.040]   But the quartet of magicians.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.400]   Now you see him?
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:22.040]   I think.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:22.600]   Anyway.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:26.840]   So there's a sequel to this bad movie in which there's a great scene
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:30.120]   that could have been done great with practical effects where one of them has a card,
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:30.920]   but they're being searched.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.200]   The fourth of them are being searched.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.080]   And they're surreptitiously because they're magicians that have a side of hand
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:39.560]   kind of like pass it to each other without anybody who's like searching them knowing that they have it.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.200]   And if they've done it as a practical effect, it could have been magic.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.720]   But instead it's all digital.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.080]   You know the card isn't there.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.440]   And then there's one where, okay, I'm going to flick it behind my ear
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:51.000]   and it's going to land in the collar of one of my compatriots.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.440]   But of course, again, let's have like a micro drone camera
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:59.320]   follow that car as it spins, spins, spins and then lands in the neck.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.160]   And it's like, okay, I've I've I'm not in the scene whatsoever.
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.720]   I watch the tech to continue this rat hole.
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.200]   The US football league, USFL launched this weekend on Fox.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:18.760]   And they are unlike the state NFL using helmet cams and they're using drones.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.280]   And they're showing off the drones.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.320]   Now admittedly the drone footage is not as high quality, but it's amazing.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:29.080]   As you're watching the game, you can see the drones buzzing around the players.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:35.320]   They even did one drone shot that stops up, starts up in the boxes,
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.080]   swoops down over the crowd onto the field.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:39.640]   Look at this.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.800]   This is incredible.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.160]   Now I'm sure players going to hit a drone at some point.
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:52.760]   But they're little and it's the this is this is I'm hoping Apple, if they get NFL,
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:55.160]   we'll we'll start to do some interesting things.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:58.680]   And this is smart of the USFL because they've got to impress people.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:02.440]   Well, the USFL is like a million dollars a game or half million dollars a game.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:05.000]   And NFL football is like 50 million dollars a game.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]   So there's a lot of a lot more.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.880]   These are consumer looking drones.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.240]   I would guess I don't really are.
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.600]   I mean, the the the main thing is is that what's great about it.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.320]   Look at this shot again.
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.040]   I just got this.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:18.920]   This is a single shot with a drone.
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:24.920]   I mean, well, and the NFL, the NFL can what you're going to see is the NFL is just going to watch
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:27.800]   them and figure out which ones which parts of these they want.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:32.120]   And if I was experimenting, they have those super short depth of field shots that don't really work.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.880]   They're interesting.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.440]   They certainly cut your attention all that boat.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:40.120]   You could you could stop it down to 2.8.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.720]   Like you don't have to open it up to 1.1.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:42.760]   They're trying to show off.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.760]   You know, I guess they have boat goods, right?
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.360]   It's also improves the storytelling.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.720]   That's that's it's all to the good.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:54.120]   I was the last thing I wanted to add quickly was that on Twitter, there's Define Siretti and Todd
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:01.400]   Viseri, two ILM artists who are supervisors and they have the best conversations and also share
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.920]   just tons of information about SFX gone right and SFX gone wrong.
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.840]   Both practical and NCG.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.920]   Because you could screw up practical effects all day long as well.
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.520]   So it's really, really interesting to learn.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:10.920]   God's great.
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.440]   You should definitely follow him.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.920]   He's got great posts all the time.
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:17.640]   Andy and I co-pick of the week.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:23.800]   This is a really great menu app that I just discovered last week, but it solves a basic problem
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:24.840]   with Bluetooth.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:30.120]   It's called a Tooth Fairy and basically all it does is allows you to create a little menu
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:36.680]   menu bar icon for each of the Bluetooth devices that you keep interacting with.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.320]   So for instance, my problem is that I've got this really great Bluetooth speaker in the office
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.720]   that I often when I'm listening, when I'm not doing a show or not really listening to
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.640]   like really, really great music or anything, I keep connecting to but there's so many steps to
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.320]   connect and disconnect from it because I don't want to then be doing a podcast and then oh,
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:58:00.280]   it thinks that my microphone and my speaker are this Google, this Google's Nest Max speaker.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:02.200]   But now it's an icon that's in my menu bar.
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.280]   I can simply click on it and it will connect, click on it again and it will disconnect.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:11.960]   If it's like my Bluetooth headphones, it will, if a third party, it will connect, disconnect to that,
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:17.800]   show me my battery, battery access, any Bluetooth device and when you correct, when you create this
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:22.920]   menu, it will also let you choose what kind of icon you want. So it's what it's you can easily
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:27.400]   get let this get out of hand. But as a solution for it, there is this thing I want I don't necessarily
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:32.040]   always keep connected to, but it's enough of a pain in the butt connecting and disconnecting that
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.880]   I wish I'm not using it as much as I wanted to. This is six bucks well spent does a very,
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:41.480]   very simple thing does it very, very well. And again, I only installed it like last week,
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:45.560]   but it's like now like three or four clicks a day with it. So it iterated six bucks.
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:49.320]   One of those apps where you feel like maybe they came up with a name first and
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:53.400]   what could a program named Tooth Fairy do?
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:59:04.600]   It's a perfect name for this program. I love it. Tooth Fairy six bucks and you can get it at
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:11.000]   the Mac App Store on set app or I imagine you can get it from the website. C-command,
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:17.240]   C-command does a lot of other stuff too. I remember. Yeah, they do spamsip. It's Michael Sy. Yeah.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:23.240]   That's who that is. I knew I knew that name. The great thing when you find a little app like
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:27.160]   this is that it is exactly like that you'll find it's an independent developer that is solving
[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:32.200]   little problems. And then you wind up spending a kind of the $30 because that sounds great.
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:38.840]   We didn't I forgot to mention this, but BB Ed had a big birthday speaking of independent
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:46.680]   developers. 30 years since it first went to a public release. Wow. 30 years? Yeah. 30 years.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:55.640]   I retweeted the post to alt.mac. We're a rich seagull posted that this thing that he's been
[01:59:55.640 --> 02:00:01.640]   working on. Oh, here it is now. It's being released as freeware. Yep. And he's still working on it.
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:07.080]   He's still improving it and still the de facto text editor because he just keeps on, keeps on
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:12.200]   improving it. The team keeps incorporating and it still doesn't suck. Yes. Still absolutely
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:15.960]   doesn't suck. The best slogan, the best and most important slogan.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:23.000]   This great if you look for it, there's a great interview with Rich Segal from on the Apple developer
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.040]   channel, Apple developer site where you also get to see his parrots, but it also talks about the
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:32.280]   history and the philosophy of the app. And it just makes you respect him and the app like all that
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:37.560]   much more. It's just amazing. Here's something you don't see on a lot of websites. Copyright 1992
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:45.400]   to 2022 bare bones. Yep. Software. Congratulations, Rich and Happy Anniversary. 30 years. That's amazing.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:52.920]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week. So this is the week before NAB. That's one of our big conferences.
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:56.680]   And so you start to see announcements and keynotes and so on and so forth. We had and of course,
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.000]   for office hours, this is a big, big couple weeks because we have lots of coverage and you should
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.400]   just go down there and do the whole thing from. So we have, I think, I think we're going to have
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.360]   five teams on Monday. Five teams over the weekend and on Monday that are all going down and they're
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.920]   feeding it all. So they're going to be a huge opportunity. Congratulations. You have guaranteed
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:18.520]   that Twit will never again do an event. A conference or bother what we could. How could you
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:22.040]   compete? How could you do that? Yeah, we should. They're going to shoot a bunch of stuff over the
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:26.040]   weekend and then they're going on Monday, they're going to go live into office hours. It's just
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.760]   going to, on Monday, just keep going for a couple hours where we just, they're live from the end.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.600]   We'll be jumping from team to team and we'll be kind of the hub. We'll be office hours on
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:41.160]   Monday morning anyway. So we're working on that. But Blackmagic went ahead and did a keynote
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:47.720]   yesterday. And I have to admit, I'm not amazed by Blackmagic very often, but I'm amazed.
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:54.120]   So what they did is they have a Blackmagic cloud. But it's not a cloud. I mean, it can be. You can
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:02:00.520]   use Dropbox and eventually Google to do this. But Grant really hates subscription services.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:05.720]   So he goes on a tie rate at the beginning. We just probably the biggest attack on subscription
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:12.600]   services ever. But then he talks about it. And what they've done is they built kind of a hardware
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:17.160]   version of this is that I can take all of my content and plug it into something and share it
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:22.280]   with people all over the world. But it's really pulling from my system. Now, that may be on a
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.760]   home connection. That's not a great thing on a business connection. That's not a big deal to
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:31.480]   be passing this stuff back and forth. Anyway, but what happens is that localizes all those copies
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:35.720]   or not, it can send proxies. It can do a lot of other things. But you can do things like LiveSync,
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:40.280]   which is like you can play back together and talk about things. You can have a colorist in one
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:45.720]   place working on it, the editor continuing to edit the audio people working on. And it's all
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.840]   coming together. And it's basically being networked through the cloud with this
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.680]   hardware. And the interface is beautiful. The control is beautiful. And for all of us that
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.880]   work in the cloud, that's not what cloud software is known for. Is is a really real question.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.880]   What is Emery Wells going to do about this? Because he is just a subscription version of this, isn't he?
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:10.920]   Yeah, I mean, but I have frame I opened right here. I don't think this really competes with
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.760]   frame I owe right now. It does have some features like that because you can share things out and
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:18.680]   have people give comments and everything else. So it's the first step towards frame I owe,
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.720]   but it's definitely not a replacement. And I don't think that they're going to spend a lot of time
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:27.320]   being interoperable. So frame I owe is got works with many, many, many different editors. And even
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.400]   though Adobe owns it, I don't think that's going to go away. Whereas resolve is really going to be
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.360]   resolved. This is going to work really well if you're in a resolve environment. And so I think that,
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:43.320]   but it is a really fascinating approach to this. We could use this because we have a 10 gigabit
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.760]   symmetric from Sonic. This has a 10 gigabit port on it. We could probably use this for ourselves.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:52.920]   So you could have a hub server where you put everything and then it populates everybody else's,
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.240]   as they depending on their bandwidth or whatever, and then they all have it locally and then you
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:05.480]   can work on it. It's a it is a really well thought out. Like just and I again, I saw they were going
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.200]   to do a cloud announcement and I we did a watch party. That's what we do in office hours. So we
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:15.480]   did a watch party for it, but I was kind of multitasking and about halfway through, I was like, oh, no,
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:20.760]   I can't believe they're doing that. And it just it works really, really well. I mean, well, on TV
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:23.960]   anyway, we haven't tested it yet. We're hoping to get some stuff in there to play with it.
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.560]   And you can start with something as easy as something that you just plug your own drives into,
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:34.040]   but you can get these huge massive servers that you could put on a 10 gig connection and be loading
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.200]   them up with content and they essentially become your kind of your cloud server, which is for a
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.560]   lot of production companies, the idea that someone's got a closed system, you know, to provide everything
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:49.560]   to everybody is useful from a security perspective as well. So so it's a it's going to be really
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:52.360]   interesting to see how well that works, but it's definitely worth paying attention to. And it's
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:56.920]   definitely worth looking if you're a production person looking at that keynote yesterday. Again,
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:01.320]   I wasn't I didn't raise any. I was like, I'm sure like I wish I could have it a 10 in the cloud,
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:07.320]   but I wasn't that interested in the in the this and I am now like we're definitely hoping to test
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:12.120]   a lot more of it because it looks really impressive. Sending a note to Russell right now.
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:19.240]   Yeah, I feel like this seems like something we could benefit from. I think we're using AWS right now.
[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:25.240]   And they're building this. The big thing is, is that resolve is such an audacious idea
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:28.120]   that we're going to take Fairlight. We're going to take resolve and we're going to put editing
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.720]   in there. We're going to put all this they just keep clumping stuff in and it's really high,
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:38.520]   really high chance of failure to do this, but they just keep they have so many engineers working
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:42.360]   on this right now. It's also just amazing to see how many new features are coming out.
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:46.920]   But if we're using Adobe Premiere, probably wouldn't be as good as if we were using this
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:52.920]   off, you wouldn't I wouldn't try to. Yeah, no, it's really for Blackmagic zone editor.
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:56.840]   Yeah, I think that at the rate that they're going, I think that
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:03.720]   Final Cut and Resolve are going to be make the environment for Premiere and Avid pretty difficult.
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:06.840]   They still they have they have a foothold. So they're going to be able to stick with that for a
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:12.840]   little while. But there's two apps that cost 300 bucks with no upgrades, no subscription costs.
[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:19.720]   One is very fast and is adding all this 3D stuff to it. The other one is just massive.
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:25.320]   Resolve is becoming this beast and between the two of them, I think that the market's getting
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:32.920]   really competitive in this area. I can't see a trajectory for Premiere and Avid to be honest.
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:35.960]   I think they can do fine. I just don't think they're going to rate. There's any roads there.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:41.640]   There's five more Dell locations. They work for Premiere.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:46.360]   I love survival. I mean, Avid's going to be fine because Avid's got a bunch of filmmakers,
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:51.080]   you know, but the problem is when those filmmakers leave, you know, it's just that, you know, it's
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:56.600]   it's getting to be a pretty it's hard to compete when you're so expensive compared to two that are
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:00.280]   putting a lot of money and time into and optimizing for a hardware platform. Yeah,
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:05.240]   because Resolve is definitely working better on the max. Yeah, ones because we're really there.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:05.960]   Today, Alex,
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:11.160]   the letter to Tim Cook about putting more marketing muscle behind Final Cut by a bunch of
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:17.240]   inspiring Hollywood directors and editors. It's too small of a market for Apple. Like,
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:21.880]   it doesn't like I get it. I get the I get the letter and I get that they really want that to happen,
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:26.440]   but it doesn't make any sense because the market on the bottom of the pyramid is so much bigger
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:31.800]   than the little market that the directors have. There's just no there's there's no ROI for Apple
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:36.680]   to go down that path because we're horrible like high end production people are horrible to work
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:40.760]   with because we have weird little things that we want to do. And now we want to button it. It's
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:45.160]   not exactly like Avid. We're going to complain about it. And, and you know, and it's not exactly,
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:49.960]   you know, we, you know, I used to have calls with a manufacturer and they go, you know, you're the
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:53.880]   only one in the world doing this. Like, we just want to make sure you're clear like four four four
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:58.680]   capture into Final Cut like, yeah, you're the only one that's doing this. And so, and you and I'm
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:03.720]   normal in the film industry. There's a whole bunch of us that are the only ones doing something and
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:08.360]   building it's a it's a fool's errand to start building for all of those things. If you don't
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:11.960]   already have them, I mean, Avid's got them. The chances of you pulling someone off an avid is very
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:17.480]   low. And the problem is is that it just there's no ROI for Apple. They're going to do a ton of work.
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.760]   They're going to throw that we're not going to get features that we want as general users because
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:25.400]   they're trying to make somebody have, you know, trying to make some big director happy, which they
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.160]   was useful when they were when it was Walter Murch and they he was giving them lots of feedback,
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:34.680]   not useful now. You know, and and so I think that I don't I get the I get the concept of it. What I
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:40.680]   do think would be really cool is again, as a user, what I would love to have Apple do is have a scene
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:45.480]   just we're paying for this film. We want one scene done in Final Cut and you tell us what what
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:49.400]   works and doesn't work. And we're going to release that scene because we paid for it. We're going to
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:55.320]   release that scene to the to our users so that they can learn how how this works. That would be all
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:59.560]   Apple needs to do. And same thing with logic like here's and here's they've already done it with
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.240]   Billy Eilish and and others just keep releasing songs as tracks and keep releasing scenes as
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.960]   tracks and do walkthroughs of those. That's all they would have to do to to do everything that's
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:13.800]   they're asking for in that letter. They don't have to change but but asking to change code for it is
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.920]   it's not going to work. The letter is asking for two things. One more marketing dollars spent to
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:25.080]   promote Final Cut but really the issue seems to be that a lot of productions won't allow the
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:29.640]   use of Final Cut because it just doesn't have the features that those like collaborative features
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:36.040]   those productions need. So they're asking as directors are asking them Apple to add specific
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.440]   features for the. Again the number one marketing they could do is release scenes. Release scenes,
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:44.760]   release scenes, releases. They don't need advertising. They would just be. They would pass that on several times.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.800]   Yeah so they write it's wonderful that Apple TV has become the first streaming platform to have
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:54.680]   a best picture winner. Disappointing to know that Final Cut Pro is so unlikely to have been a
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:10:01.320]   possible choice as code is editing app. But it doesn't like there's the thing is that that again
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.040]   when I thought the market happening is the profession. Renee I don't know Renee knows this
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:09.880]   better than I do but when I talk to influencers there's a if they're not hoping to get into the
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:17.000]   business somewhere everyone that we work with is using Final Cut or you know or native apps for
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.720]   them for the platform you know and and so you know it's and then when you talk about education
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:26.200]   and corporate they're just unless the only time you see the other ones is you have people who
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:31.000]   really think that someday they'll be you know a lot of corporate is filled with people who
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000]   think they're going to some they end up in Hollywood and so then they then they then they want to
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.520]   use the right tool that they can do that with but but when you have people that are just getting
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.440]   that are paying for the product themselves and don't get paid by the hour.
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.000]   They're almost all of them reason Final Cut or resolve you know like it's you know that's the
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.080]   that's the difference you know. The thing that hurts me more is that Apple has a bunch of features I
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.920]   want Final Cut but they don't move them over like I would love all the snapping that's in keynote I
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:58.760]   would love the reduce the move silence it's a logic there's just so many little things
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:03.240]   and just have that engineer walk over there and move it. Well I mean I want I want to be able to
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:10.280]   design something I want all the all the behaviors that keynote has should be in motion like if I
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.680]   want that little thing to drop down or fly over that should be a behavior in motion like I'm just
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.840]   the motion filter should be in Final Cut like just propagate that stuff. Well the motion filter you
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:22.920]   can get into Final Cut essentially I mean you can go through the yes the the generator projects but
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:31.720]   but the the but the I'm too dumb well. Yeah so Alex Goner can. So so anyway hi Alex. So the
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:36.920]   and Mark Spencer and those guys can you know the but the thing is is that I do think I would love to
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.080]   be able to build something in keynote open it in motion and have all those behaviors just come
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:45.000]   through and then make it better you know with what I want to do. I mean I love the product I use it
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.720]   all the time but but also for me you know there's points where I jump off the product I I when I'm
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:53.800]   doing lots of fast edits and I put things together I'm using Final Cut when I right now I have a heavy
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:59.480]   lifting project that has tons of color and tons of complex sound and I'm in resolve. You know like
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:03.160]   because it's I just don't know how I don't know how I would do it and I don't know how I would do it
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.960]   in Final Cut and to to that point but I don't know it would take so many coding years for them to
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:12.680]   close the gap between what resolve has that I'm using and where Final Cut is right now.
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:21.160]   Interesting so in other words forget it guys we can keep on having a sign letter there's not
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:25.240]   any three things I just don't think I just don't think that Apple is going to go down that
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.520]   open sign letters often this is not this for a little it's my experience they're just asking I
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.840]   think that they're just not thinking about it from a practical level of of what is useful for
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:39.960]   and again Apple has a giant market of individuals YouTube yeah creators and so forth but they're
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:43.400]   not going to get heard to how many people how many film productions we're talking hundreds
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:48.680]   no thousand I this is an unconfirmed rumor so I'm just going to lay it out unconfirmed
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:52.840]   remember that the number one editing app in the world as I'm moving the number two is Final Cut
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:57.240]   I believe that yeah the number in installed base is bigger and bigger and cut than in the other
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:03.000]   ones almost guaranteed to be the case yeah yeah so well then now you know I want to move you
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:08.200]   update is great too yeah is it have you played with it it's good for again it's not good for
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.640]   pros it's good for home users it's good for like if if I would if they had live events now and like
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:16.680]   I don't have the staff of the Verge like the Verge has like eight people working on these things and
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.520]   I had to go in there and just put a hands-on together I don't know that I would open Final Cut I think
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.600]   I would get my clips I would open one of those templates I would throw all of those clips in there
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:29.320]   and I would be done faster than if I had to build a lot to my kids my kids put together little
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.920]   trailers and I mean they go to the Apple Store and the Apple Store gives you a little tutorial on how
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.480]   to do it and then and then they do it and I'm like these are really fun like they're really cool and
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.360]   they're just a template and they just throw them together and it pops out the other end and it's a
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:44.760]   lot of fun and it's you know you're not going to win an Emmy with it but it or but but it's still
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.480]   there is so much enjoyment to that point I mean Microsoft actually went out and bought a company
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:55.800]   with a terrible name clip champ to put this into Windows so all Windows PCs now come with this
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:00.120]   kind of simple iMovie style editor for a long time. I think it talks with Flashback
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.880]   for a long time Windows came with Windows Movie Maker which was really pretty awful I mean but
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:13.400]   I think even Microsoft recognizes you need to have something for the whole market like this.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:17.240]   I think if Apple really wanted to market themselves I think that they should go
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.760]   go do more acquisitions of like motion VFX which builds templates for motion that work in Final Cut
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.640]   just buy them buy them and then triple their staff and let them just keep building
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:33.960]   the coolest templates you know and and it's and you know and when you open an emotion there's all
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:37.240]   the pieces there you can pull them apart you can actually learn a lot just by opening their
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.200]   projects and and so when it comes to I always think Apple's buy that and just bundle it in
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:47.800]   that like you do with effects you know sound and sounds and logic and doing more of that I think
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.280]   Apple would do better just giving us more grit and stop worrying about Hollywood then you know it's
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.880]   not they're not level tools they're just it's just such a tiny little market and they're so
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.200]   difficult like it's not it's not like they're but remember when they launched Final Cut they
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:06.520]   got Walter Merch to use it I mean they made a big deal like oh look that was because that's
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:10.680]   because Avid said that they were dropping the Mac when Apple was trying to survive oh that's
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.320]   right they got into cross they got into across they crossed Steve you know that this was a that
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.760]   was a Steve Final Cut final cut was a little hobby until Avid wrote that press release and then
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.080]   it was a weapon like it was you know like just like you know it's like it's that scene in
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:30.680]   in unforgiven where he's kicking the bejibbers out of English Bob you know he's like I'm not
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.760]   kicking you Bob I'm kicking all the other people you know all the other guys that come here you know
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:41.480]   telling them out in Kansas and Nebraska you know this isn't there's no there's no gold here and if
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.800]   there was you wouldn't want it you know so that that's what Apple was doing with Avid and
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:51.240]   incidentally while they did get a lot of mileage out of that I think Merch has since said it was a
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:16:00.360]   it was a very hard thing to edit yeah even then a cold mountain yeah yeah yeah but he but he but
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.760]   he made it happen I mean here's the thing that that engineering yeah that in one version it jumped
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.560]   you know 10 versions it was amazing and it tells you what happens when you're dealing and again
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:14.120]   it's one person it's not all of Hollywood it was a person the right person that's going to give you
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:23.240]   feedback on exactly what needs to happen next so yeah yeah all right wow this was good I think
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:27.000]   we had some of the best conversations of the show were in the interstitial conversations in the
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.680]   picks of the week thank you gentlemen as always a learned panel Renee Richie YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:40.600]   secret project with Georgia Dow gonna be public at some point yes not announced yet but yes we're
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:46.040]   prepping we're working hard will it make videos that you never I make a lot of videos that I never
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:50.440]   release and so it's like the secret project that will always reseak reseak videos and put them on
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:53.960]   like friends I don't have a vault full of music videos for the apocalypse these stuff is gonna
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:17:01.480]   come in well we look forward to it and in the meanwhile youtube.com/ReneeRitchie I like this this
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:09.240]   is good you now got a playlist start here get Apple Smart Fast very cool idea I like that the
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:16.520]   playlists I think are very valuable and then of course there's the Renee Richie reaction shots of
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:21.000]   all kinds well I was just trying to think like because everyone is a super excited about the M
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.240]   2 so I was trying to figure out like but if we look at the A14 compared to the A15 and you look at a
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:30.360]   really good deep dive like a Nantec produced you could start to theorize out what M2 will be
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:34.680]   compared to the M1 so I went through that mental exercise. What is somebody was asking the chairman
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:40.600]   I don't know what is the clock speed of the M1 versus the M2 the actual apple never says well we
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:45.080]   don't know I'm too yet but like the clock the clock speeds for the M1 are the same as the A50 the
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:51.160]   M1 went up by like forget like 10 percent or something or two went up by 20 percent went from 3.0 to 3.2
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:58.040]   and 3.2 to 3.4 so 2.8 the efficiency cores went from 2.8 to 3.0 and the the big cores the p cores went
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:02.760]   from 3 to 3.2 and we anticipate the same thing will happen with these next cores because of the
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:07.720]   process the new process note and because apple can push a little faster and bigger enclosures
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:12.520]   so I'm figuring like a 10 percent 8 to 10 percent bump okay okay on frequencies clock speed isn't
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:17.320]   the by any means the most important this the even apple was a great pains years ago to talk about
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:24.040]   the megahertz myth we have a megahertz in quite some time but apple will drop it like they don't
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.320]   really care about being top right hand corner of the perf graph they'll much rather have like
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:33.320]   longer battery life they'll trade that off every day right 3.2 is not shabby that's a decent
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:38.200]   nope clock speed and turns out like all the ones that go faster they they need like even in
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.920]   phones they need vapor chambers an after-passing resort right right Andy and Akko when are you
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:51.160]   going to be on GBH next uh day early this week but 1230 on Thursday go to wgph news.org to stream
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:58.520]   it live or later and is your favorite diner still serving uh the the finest cinnamon buns in known
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:05.080]   to man or whatever it is you like uh what's on let's get we're gonna do Andy's diner pick of the week
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:12.040]   from now on I will I will say that my my current favorite diner has a april special of pineapple
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:17.000]   upside-down pancakes that I've been holding I've been holding out for until like a day when I feel
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.040]   like I really really need pineapple upside-down pancakes it's gonna have to happen probably
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:28.840]   tomorrow morning I think wow that sounds pretty darn good if you see this is this is this is
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:34.760]   medically contraindicated unless you know if you if you if you if you feel as though you're going
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:39.080]   to a diner thinking that no I went to a diner two or three weeks ago it would be medically
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:45.560]   inadvisable for me to have a diner breakfast more frequently than like once or twice every two months
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:50.680]   then you're not dinering correctly you need you need to basically say all rules are off if there
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:56.040]   if there is a chocolate fudge brownie pancake waffle with a with a with a with a with a terema zoo
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:20:02.600]   uh of burrito next to it I'm gonna order it but don't turn down the dol whip pineapple upside down
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:06.760]   pancake because that would be a nice topping on that I'm just saying
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:12.520]   they're okay with bringing things in from the outside so i think about that thank you Andy
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:20.440]   uh Alex Lindsey office hours dot global 24/7 the place to find out about well just about anything
[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:25.320]   you'd ever want to know we're talking about this is friday our our morning session is talking about
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:32.760]   craft services but see I think that's great because tomorrow tomorrow you know yesterday we were
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:38.600]   covering um you know the black magic tomorrow we're covering max on launch and then we're talking
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:43.880]   about uh being a host actually on thursday and um and then but friday friday we're talking about
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:48.520]   crafty that's nice and um I will say though though if you're interested in live events we are now
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:52.280]   doing stuff with some concerts we have you know I have a test stage that i'm working on and I
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:58.840]   every once in a while we get to take it over and we have the one of the top concert uh directors
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:04.520]   in the world calling the show from her home in omohanda brassica and we have people who are
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:07.880]   coming in to learn to do the camera operation and there's people who are cut I was cutting the show
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:12.760]   the last one but you get to listen to the comms you get to listen to her call the show and it changes
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:17.080]   everything about how you think about cutting a show and I would if you're in into anything like
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:21.640]   that I would highly recommend it we don't put them up online because it's a little more you know but
[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:29.320]   but uh but yeah and that's tard Reynolds super saturday sabido jigante is amazing playing the fiddle
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:37.000]   yeah that's amazing it's right I mean we're that he's like fill harmonic level uh violinist and
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.680]   and he he also by the way has a ton of modular synths and he mixes it all together and he loops
[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:49.080]   it and wow so it's it's quite a thing it's just amazing office hours dot global and if you want
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:58.600]   to hire Alex and his dozen Mac studios to stream your next event oh nine oh dot media oh nine oh dot
