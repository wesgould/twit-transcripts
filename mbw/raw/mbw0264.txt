[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.000]   And joining us today, I guess Alex Lindsey is once again
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.400]   on the road.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.360]   That man travels more, I tell you.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880]   But fortunately, we've got our buddy here.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.160]   Alex takes two to replace Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.400]   But first, let me launch Windows.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   PUSTED!
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.800]   We'll talk about why I'm launching Windows in the second
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.080]   to first say hello to Annie and Otko of the Chicago Sun
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.560]   Times and these celestial waste of bandwidths.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.800]   Hello, I'm Phil.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.480]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.520]   All sits really quite wonderful to be here.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   And I'm glad to be talking to you right now, especially you.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   Listeners by the podcast and live stream.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.640]   This is all about you.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.160]   Andrew is back home.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.600]   The power is back.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.840]   And I presume the freezer is loaded with Papa John's pizzas.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.640]   OK, well, I wish I could pretend that that was not
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.840]   the first thing I went out and bought.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.400]   Yeah, it's like-- it's sort of like when
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.160]   I buy a new laptop, it's like I don't want
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.080]   to just do the migration because there's
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.760]   a lot of old stuff there that was probably
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400]   I shouldn't have had there to begin with.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520]   So literally, it's a three week stage where stage one was,
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.560]   yes, I bought a 12-pack of soda, four frozen pizzas.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   Hey.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.040]   And eggs and milk.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.120]   This week is I'm going to replace all the frozen vegetables
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.080]   and the frozen stuff.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.160]   Next week, I can finally buy fresh fruit and vegetables.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.200]   You've got to have priorities in life, that's all.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.720]   That's all.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.640]   And it was nice to find that my sister got me
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.760]   one of those cheese balls with the nuts packed around it
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.080]   for Christmas about two years ago.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.920]   So it's probably a good idea I get rid of that, anyway.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   Now it's all cheese balls.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   It's good.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.920]   Cheese logs.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.840]   I think it just shows you how much I love my sister
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.040]   that I wanted to hold on to that.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.840]   So it's just so long.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.480]   I can't eat it.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.080]   It's from Sis.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.840]   Exactly.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.760]   Also, where does your--
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   Back to her.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.840]   --from Liverpool.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.320]   Mr. Don McAllister of Screencasts Online.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.760]   Great to have you done once again.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.240]   Hello.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.800]   Leo, hi.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.400]   How are you doing?
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.200]   Look at that.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.480]   Great picture.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.120]   Is that good?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.640]   What kind of--
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.560]   Oh, by the way, thanks so much for inviting me on episode
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.680]   H.264.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680]   Is that good?
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   Fantastic.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.000]   And realize that you mentioned it.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   Well, that's good.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.920]   What kind of camera are you using?
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   Because that really looks fantastic.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.800]   It's just one of these--
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.880]   I know it's not a Panasonic.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120]   It's a Sony with a HDMI out.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   Ah, it's a wonderful--
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.640]   It's a wonderful--
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.160]   Materox MXO2 capture box.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.520]   And then plug that into Skype.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.800]   And it seems to work fine.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.320]   I haven't got my usual pink color, which I have with the other webcam
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.080]   that I normally use.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   It's fantastic.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.840]   You actually look better than Andy.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.920]   And you're thousands of miles further away.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   Yeah, it's incredible, isn't it?
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.120]   I don't know what looking better than Andy, but--
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.400]   Also here, it's great to have--
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.560]   from Big Nerd, Ranch, Aaron Hillagas is here.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.000]   He's the author of a number of great books on iOS and cocoa
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.720]   programming, but also runs perhaps the best training
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.160]   in writing software for iOS and Macintosh.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.640]   And Windows too, I think, yes?
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.680]   We have not any Windows yet.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.160]   Not yet.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.640]   Android.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.200]   Android is--
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.160]   There's a lot of Android work.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.360]   We do a lot of eyes on work.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.000]   And you were regaling the audience before I got here,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.440]   which is great with stories of C, objective C, Xcode.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.520]   I'm working on a new book.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.680]   It's a four beginners book.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.400]   And it assumes you know that.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.480]   Oh, that's great.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.720]   And a lot of it is about how to think like a programmer.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.760]   So we talk a lot about memory and addresses
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.600]   and the heap and the stack.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.040]   Oh, that's correct.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.520]   And so someone on the chat room was asking about it.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   So that's Objective C, the Big Nerd, Ranch Guide.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.040]   And it's coming out soon.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.320]   The best hobby ever, I think, is computer programming.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.800]   Definitely.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.320]   And I have a lot of hobbies, photography and hand radio.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.720]   But there's something about programming,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.760]   because everybody who watches this, I guess, probably,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.840]   has a computing device that you can program on.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.600]   And so it's just fun to have that kind of control
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.720]   and that software control of, you know,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.000]   total ultimate control of what's going on in there.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.760]   It's fantastic.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's really empowering.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.720]   And you learn so much about how things work.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.600]   Of course, the downside is that you
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.960]   start running a program for everything.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.400]   Like you find yourself doing an in-grapette,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.840]   you're like, oh, I'll just write a script to do that.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.960]   And what would have been a 15 minute job
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.800]   if you'd just done it with an editor
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.920]   now becomes a three-
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.480]   Forever.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.520]   It's a month project.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.640]   Forever and ever, ever.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.960]   I'm going to move that mic real close to you.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.560]   OK.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.400]   You're taller than most people in the studio.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.280]   And so I have to aim at it.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.240]   iPhone news tops the list today.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.760]   The latest is that iOS 5, the prediction goes,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.920]   will be released to developers 10 days from now on the 23rd.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.320]   I'm sorry, released to OEMs.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.400]   It's been out for developers version 7, I think, right?
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.600]   And beta 7.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.360]   iOS 5.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.440]   iOS 5, beta 7.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.920]   Yes, it's been released to--
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.440]   And the rumor is that the gold master will be out on the 23rd.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.520]   That's the one that you can actually put on a phone.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   I can't tell anything specific about iOS 5, but I love you.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.680]   Oh, you're NDA.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.880]   That's--
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.320]   I am NDA.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.440]   That's the real catch.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.720]   I could spend 99 bucks and get access to the iOS betas.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.640]   And then you can talk about it.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.520]   Then I wouldn't be able to say anything.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.720]   So we have people like you to break your NDAs.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   I know there's so much, though, isn't there on the web?
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.480]   It's fairly easy to keep track of what's
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.800]   going on with iOS 5.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.720]   It's interesting with the timescales
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   for this release, though, because again,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   Apple are trying to juggle different things that
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.000]   juggle in their infrastructure, the juggling the iPhone 5,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.280]   the juggling iOS 5.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.080]   They're also juggling iCloud as well, which I understand,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.440]   if I wasn't covered by NDA and could talk about it,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.920]   they've actually now wrapped up iCloud into 10.7.2.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.800]   So having to coordinate all this activity together
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.560]   to launch everything at the same time.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.480]   So if that rumor is correct, and that sounds right,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.720]   23rd would mean they'd be able to start putting them on phones
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.560]   right away.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.840]   And then it takes 10 days to 14 days to get them into the stores.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.800]   We're talking roughly mid-October for an iPhone 5 ship.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.360]   That's the rumor.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.920]   Sound good?
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.440]   Everybody feel comfortable with that?
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.240]   Let's go with that one.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   All right.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.640]   That's the--
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.120]   That's the-- we're going to call it the iPhone 5, yes.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.880]   And we don't know, right?
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.680]   It might be the 4S.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.720]   Might be the iPhone jiggly box.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.760]   We don't know.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.360]   Could be the iPhone Tim Cook Rocks model.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   Well, just going to the iPhone--
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.920]   I wouldn't even go to his head.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.880]   Sprint, it may even get the iPhone.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.240]   Bloomberg is saying this is, I think, a great rumor.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.320]   In fact, one that I kind of makes me salivate a little bit.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.240]   Sprint might be offering an iPhone 5, whatever it is.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.920]   Because we'll have Verizon AT&T Sprint.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.400]   And Sprint might be the one to have an unlimited data plan.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.120]   At least that's what Bloomberg is saying.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.720]   Does that seem possible?
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.880]   It does seem possible.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.720]   I mean, it was a really AT&T.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.280]   Sprint's kind of a way back in the pack also ran.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.240]   So they need to be competitive, right?
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.800]   Why would you buy a Sprint iPhone unless there
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.320]   was something special about it?
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.800]   And that's always how they've had unlimited data plans
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.040]   to begin with, and they phase those out.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.640]   And now Sprint's coming and saying, hey,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.720]   you can still get an unlimited data plan with us.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.040]   I also notice we're seeing a lot of ads
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.160]   I saw on the Monday Night Football last night,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.880]   AT&T ads several times pointing out
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.160]   that AT&T is the only service you can make a phone call
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.920]   and get data.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.880]   You know, that guy changing his baby's diaper,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.480]   checking the football, which I thought
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.800]   was incredibly stupid.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.280]   But it made that point.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.080]   And you can't on Sprint either.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.760]   CDMA, which is Sprint and Verizon,
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.400]   both disallow data during a phone call.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.560]   So it's interesting that AT&T is starting to push that.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.640]   That sounds to me like they want to be your iPhone choice,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.680]   right, Andy?
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.400]   Yeah, well, they've always taken that position
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.600]   and going all the way back to Verizon.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   There's just so little to differentiate the two.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.080]   That's really the only feature that you could say,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.600]   well, the AT&T phone does this,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.120]   the Verizon iPhone does not.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.120]   And I think anything that AT&T can do
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.480]   to get people not to really look at the quality
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.720]   of the two different networks
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.440]   is probably a really good strategy for AT&T to follow
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.200]   because that has always been my biggest differentiator
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.080]   between the two.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.880]   Verizon historically has always had a stronger,
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.360]   more reliable and faster network than AT&T.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.040]   There's certainly a lot more aggressive
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.520]   with their 4G network rollout than AT&T has been.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.600]   So if there is, I think in 2012,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.520]   a 4G compatible iPhone,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.360]   that's gonna be a huge leg up
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.040]   that Verizon would have over AT&T
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.320]   unless AT&T does something miraculous
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.520]   between now and January, February or March.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.200]   So really, that's really all they have to push right now.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.640]   Dr. Moms in our chat room says,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.120]   you know what would be so special about it?
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.960]   Sprint's data and phones are so underutilized
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.240]   you'd actually be able to make a call.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.480]   It does, Sprint has a great data network.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.320]   I have to say the 4G network is really good.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.760]   But if you can get it.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.920]   Exactly, that's exactly right.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.640]   It's not a problem when you're in a big metro area.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.080]   It's even not a problem when you're in sort of
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.040]   a renowned suburb, but it comes down to that.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.880]   It really, no, seriously, it comes down to the point
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.280]   where you're streaming Pandora,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.160]   you're driving from point A to point B
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.360]   and then suddenly the signal drops out,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.200]   which is something that happens on the weaker networks
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.520]   like T-Mobile or Sprint.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.880]   Rass on Verizon, Verizon is so good
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.400]   that when I broke down in the middle of absolutely nowhere
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.160]   by the side of the road, I had two different phones with me,
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.840]   but the Verizon phone was able to get,
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.600]   let me call AAA, even the AT&T phone said,
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.240]   ah, sorry, we didn't plan on anybody
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.720]   basically stopping here on the side of I-95
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.160]   and for a picnic.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.840]   That's why I tell Lisa I have to have one of each.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.120]   It's just in case, I break down,
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.560]   I have to have AT&T Verizon Sprint and T-Mobile.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   Just in case.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760]   Just in case.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.720]   Don, are there unlimited data plans in the UK
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.640]   or is that also a thing of the past?
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.040]   Yeah, there's starting to wind them down.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.720]   There are a couple left us, I think,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.120]   but I mean, it's great to offer an unlimited data plan.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   It's a great marketing tool,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.000]   but whether anyone actually needs them these days
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.720]   is a bit of a mood point.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   I think my main interest with the launch of the next iPhone
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.440]   is the international aspect of it.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.560]   Will they launch in several countries?
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.080]   They seem to have done over the past couple of launches
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.120]   for various things, but they're selling a bit close
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.320]   to the wind with it being so close to Christmas
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.120]   that I do hope they are able to at least launch it
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   in all their primary markets simultaneously
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.880]   rather than having us to wait till a couple of months after
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.160]   it's launched in the US.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.640]   You have it, you have what, Orange?
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.880]   You have...
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   Who's Orange? O2? O2 with the main ones.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.920]   O2 with the primary carriers first,
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.800]   but then everyone else has sort of come on board ever since.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.360]   You can get iPhone plans and iPhones now
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.560]   from basically anybody in the UK,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.160]   including the major supermarkets
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.920]   who have their own branded version of, you know,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.680]   you can get Tesco, which is a huge supermarket here in the UK.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.760]   You can actually buy phones and get data plans
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   and everything from Tesco.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.520]   Can you get an iPhone from Tesco?
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.720]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.200]   You can get the whole range.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.560]   They've actually got the whole range of Mac laptops,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.160]   desktops, the whole works,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.240]   even the wireless devices as well, the ports, et cetera.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.960]   Actually, I think that's only in the, like, really big stores,
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.360]   but they're online service.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   You can actually definitely buy literally
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.280]   everything in the Apple range from Tesco.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.480]   That's amazing.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.840]   Yeah, Tesco points.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.920]   They have a big loyalty scheme, so you can buy one.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.200]   What do you get on your Apple gear
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.440]   and get thousands of Tesco points if you want to?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.920]   We need a Tesco.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   Well, they're all over the place.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.280]   They're in China now, I believe, as well.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.720]   Tesco. Oh, oh.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.440]   Very big.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.240]   Foxconn building 150,000 iPhone.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.560]   Next gen. What are we going to call it?
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.800]   Next gen. Next gen iPhone is a day.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.280]   150,000 a day.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.440]   Apple predicting, of course, huge demand.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.640]   Will we see lines? Will we see shortages?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.760]   Should I wait and start,
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.040]   except for my chair in line at AT&T soon?
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.680]   Or because is it available everywhere?
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.880]   Predictions.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.280]   Will there be riots?
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.720]   The whole industry lives.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.680]   My prediction is that there just aren't that many
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.400]   killer features left to go into the zone.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.920]   And people aren't going to be that interested.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.040]   There may be a price drop.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.400]   There may be a couple of new features,
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.640]   but it's not going to be riot worthy at all.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.480]   We're now at the stage where you wait till your contract runs
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.440]   before you get your next phone.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:03.920]   Exactly.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.280]   In fact, I just saw an article that said
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.200]   people are still very happy with the iPhone 5.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.520]   They don't feel a need for a new phone at all.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.920]   I think that's probably the case.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.400]   Although I have to say there's some Apple fanatics,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.560]   most of whom are fans of the show,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.720]   who will be waiting in line.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.400]   Everybody who listens to this show will be waiting.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.600]   We're talking a very small riot.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.480]   It's a tiny riot.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.880]   I think there's a lot of pent up demand though.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.320]   So I'm sure there was going to be a line anyway.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.600]   It depends how big the line's going to be.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.680]   And I think people are now getting used to the fact
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.480]   and sort of working out.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.040]   Well, actually, because the supply is so good now,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.880]   I don't usually have to get in line to actually get something,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.040]   you know, I'd have to queue in life for six or seven hours
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   to actually get one.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.240]   There's normally a supply for the first couple of days.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.680]   So that might put a lot of people off,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.200]   but you're certainly going to see lines on launch.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.880]   I would think almost definitely.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.040]   New features, we've already talked about this A5,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.360]   obviously the dual core processors that's in the iPad.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.200]   But here's a picture of Sushi that tells us a little bit about
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.240]   the iPhone,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.360]   Dungeons,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.760]   Camera,
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.560]   Dun Dun Dun.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.480]   What can we deduce from this idea, not go?
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.800]   I actually saw some conversation on a message board
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.720]   comparing that Sushi to the kind of Sushi that is available
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   in the Apple Campus cafeteria.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.360]   Just to see it.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   Yes, you see, because that's sort of like a...
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.240]   You see how they slice the ginger?
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.000]   They only slice it that way in the cup.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.440]   Very appily, the way the ginger and wasabi are touching,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.360]   but not intermingled.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.000]   And you see here, this is urchin,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.200]   see urchin, Ro, I found out.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.320]   I thought it was hummus.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.600]   Have you ever had it?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.040]   No, it's awful.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.880]   It's like eating out of a baby diaper.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.520]   It looks like eating out of a baby diaper.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.320]   So there's XF information that's attached to the photo.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.560]   It makes people think that this might be an iPhone 5 photo.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.800]   But of course, you can edit XF information.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.680]   The people who are saying that,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.720]   "Well, it's low resolution.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.680]   We'd expect to see an 8 megapixel camera taking this picture."
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.240]   But you can always just simply change the resolution.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.000]   So it's just another thing to click on and look at
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.120]   and think about and go,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.640]   as a reason for not starting work at nine o'clock
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.360]   as you're supposed to, but starting at 9.15, 9.20.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.480]   That's why I was like today.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.120]   I was parsing the XF data on this.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   So according to the XF data,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.920]   which Andy rightly points out, could be modified.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.760]   This was posted on Flickr inadvertently
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.680]   by a person believed to be an Apple engineer.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   It was quickly moved to private.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.840]   However, people captured it, of course.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.320]   A couple of things to point out that again,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.640]   are speculative because the XF could be edited.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.440]   Although, I have to say, I think this unlikely.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.480]   One, the GPS coordinates were in fact one infinite loop.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.640]   Two, they do have sushi at the Apple,
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.800]   at the Apple lunch facility.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.440]   Three, while this is clearly cropped,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.560]   because you see it's a square aspect ratio.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   The native resolution of this was in fact,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.760]   an eight megapixel camera.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.000]   The F stop was, I'm trying to remember,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.320]   I think it was 2.2 compared to the 2.4.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.360]   The angle was a little less wide,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.880]   or was it more wide?
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.360]   No, man, now I'm forgetting all my facts.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.800]   I had them, I memorized everything here.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.440]   There was a man by the side of the road
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.800]   who opened an umbrella right before the motorcade came in,
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.960]   despite the fact it was a sunny day in Dallas.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.600]   That's right, exactly.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.960]   However, a couple of things have been deduced for this,
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.800]   from this one, is that this could very well be
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.240]   the eight megapixel Sony camera,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.040]   that Howard Stringer, Sony President Howard Stringer,
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.920]   was trumpeting as Apple purchasing.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.120]   This was months ago.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.800]   They're gonna be using a lightness camera.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.000]   He doesn't look like that.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.840]   He is British, however.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.240]   So maybe I should have had Don do that one.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.640]   Anyway, also though, it could be another chip,
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.120]   which Apple uses, was it the OmniVision,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.600]   something like that.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   Anyway, that's all we can deduce from this plate of sushi.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.160]   Am I correct, sir?
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.040]   I would say so.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.920]   I mean, it's a nice picture,
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.680]   it's a nice, maybe hungry for to go to the supermarket.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.000]   It's pretty clear.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.200]   The supermarket has nice sushi,
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.720]   it may be going by the California roll
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.320]   with the extra ginger, but that was about it.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.880]   It's a fairly crisp picture, however,
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.160]   as some have pointed out,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.600]   not remarkably better than the five megapixel iPhone 4 camera.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.840]   The thing is that, I mean, with the iPhone 4,
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.880]   I just went away for a weekend over to Paris
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.560]   and the usual touristy bits,
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.800]   and I just took my iPhone 4 with me.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.000]   I didn't wanna take any other cameras,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.440]   I'm not a big camera guy.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.680]   But the pictures were fantastic,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.000]   I was really, really pleased.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.840]   So even if it's just a slight incremental update
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.480]   to the camera, that's gonna please me now
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   and because the iPhone 4 camera is perfectly adequate
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.320]   for the snaps that I take
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.960]   and they literally are snaps, but they're great.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.520]   - I think those are the only two things
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.880]   that they can really upgrade at this point.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.800]   They can upgrade the camera,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.520]   they can upgrade the data speeds.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.200]   Anything else they add to the iPhone at this point
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.400]   isn't going to have that sort of immediate,
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.600]   sort of gut checking.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.960]   Ooh, I know it'll cost me extra 100 bucks
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.760]   to get on my contract, but 100 bucks,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.920]   I've got 100 bucks I will make in the future.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   I want this iPhone.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.000]   (laughing)
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.720]   The, let's see, the, it's the same resolution
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.640]   as the Sony X-More R sensor,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.800]   their A-megapixel sensor,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.960]   and Omnivision's 8-megapixel sensor.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.280]   This is actually some really good footage
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.040]   from R's Technica as is always to be expected.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.520]   The lens is F2.4, that's a little better than the F2.8
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.800]   of the iPhone.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.040]   For the focal length, 4.28 millimeters
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.800]   compared to the iPhone 4's 3.85 millimeters,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.160]   that's the equivalent on this size sensor
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   of about 33 millimeters,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.480]   which is a little bit less wide
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.280]   than the 28 millimeter equivalents on the iPhone 5.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.880]   So let me get those all straight.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.640]   But as Andy points out, it's all mere guesswork
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.680]   at this point.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.520]   - Yeah.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.000]   - But it is important, I think it's important,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.240]   and we talked about this on Twitter,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.400]   it's important because as this camera gets incrementally better,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.640]   it means fewer and fewer people are gonna buy pocket cameras.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.840]   But this becomes effectively your camera.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.800]   - Yeah, and it's also an easy differentiator
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.560]   for Apple between their models and the Android phones.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.120]   That Android phones are becoming better and better and better,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.560]   and it's just almost at the exact same level
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.000]   as the iPhone is right now.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.880]   So if there's one feature that can really dump a lot of R&D
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.200]   and something that's two people with two phones
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.280]   will come home with two completely different experiences,
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.240]   it is the camera.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.880]   I've got the Droid Bionic in for testing,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.640]   and I think it's my year. - Oh, how do you like that?
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.320]   - I like it.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.640]   I like the speed, I like the screen.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.120]   What I don't like is what Motorola tends to do,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.480]   Motorola and Verizon tend to do to Android
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.520]   when they turn it into a Droid phone.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.480]   But my usual test suite, whether it's a camera or a phone,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.640]   is Bates Hall that really immensely cool
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.160]   research Hall library at Boston Public Library.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.200]   There's a tile on the marble floor that has a crack in it.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.960]   That's perfect mark, I just always put my heels on that exact
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.160]   same mark, take the exact same picture,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.640]   took pictures with the Bionic, with the iPhone 4
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.840]   and with just a regular still camera for comparison.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.400]   Absolutely no comparison.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.720]   Not only because of the software that was running
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.440]   on the iPhone was so much easier to use
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.680]   than the camera app that you get with the Bionic,
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.040]   but the Bionic was stupid enough to say,
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.520]   I think I'll give them a nice long exposure here
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.840]   'cause I don't know how to deal with this.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   So it was kind of blurry and scratchy
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600]   and really an unusable picture.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.440]   - Have you posted these on Flickr yet?
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.240]   Or am I looking at older pictures now?
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.200]   - Oh, you're looking at older pictures.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.120]   If you go to the BPL library, you might find
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.080]   one of these shots.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.560]   - Okay.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.320]   - But there's also, or might be tag Bates Hall,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.360]   usually I tag them based on like product reviews.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.440]   I haven't posted the Bionic shots.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.280]   - Okay, okay.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.160]   - I mean, I might actually just to be fair,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.400]   I might have to go back and reshoot it
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   because I don't know, it's definitely a data point
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.600]   to say that it's selected the combination
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.680]   of exposure settings that would result
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.120]   in a shaky handheld image, rest the iPhone 4
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.200]   has never had any kind of problem with that.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.960]   But it's also probably good to say,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.160]   I know this is gonna screw it up,
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.760]   so I'm gonna make this as solid as possible,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.440]   so at least people can say when it doesn't select
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.160]   a stupid slow shutter speed, here's how much noise comes in
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.200]   and here's how it deals with the balance of plating.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.680]   I've yet to see a single phone that can come anywhere
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   near to how the iPhone can handle any situation.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.400]   It's like what Don said.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.920]   It really is a credible camera in and of itself.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.680]   I'm not sure if I'd be so bold as to say,
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.800]   I'm going to this one of the iconic photo cities
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.480]   in the entire world, I'm not gonna take a real camera with me.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.080]   But time and time again, when I'm in a position
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.800]   where I didn't think I'd need my camera,
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.360]   but I wanna take a good picture,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.040]   it's shocking the quality of the pictures you can take
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.880]   with it.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.920]   - And I think it's as well though,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.320]   it's also not just the optics,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.880]   it's the software as well.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.240]   And the responsiveness of the camera.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.160]   And of course with iOS 5, again, it's no secret
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.280]   to know that they've actually now switched on
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.080]   the functionality work by, you can use one of the volume
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.480]   controls to actually act as a shutter button.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.560]   And also you've got the immediate access to the camera,
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.440]   even if your phone is locked, so you don't have to unlock
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.880]   your phone to actually get to the camera.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.000]   And they're just two minor points.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.880]   We've yet still to see when they're gonna do anything else
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.280]   with the HDR and stuff in there.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.880]   But there's so many good HDR apps for the,
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.400]   I mean, while I was in Paris, I took some fantastic HDR
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.600]   photographs using HDR Pro, I think it was one of the
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.440]   applications, absolutely superb, fantastic quality.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.920]   And you know, it's not just the optics,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.600]   it's what the camera does with the images as well,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.960]   once it's been captured and processed.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.400]   - That's where they have a real head start.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.680]   There are Android apps and some of the iPhone,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.160]   iconic iPhone apps have been moved over to Android,
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.520]   but still things like Camera Plus,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.960]   the things that people really love are iPhone only.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.320]   It really dominates in terms of a range of software
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.560]   available for this.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.200]   Have you posted those?
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.080]   I'm looking for your Flickr here.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.680]   Have you posted those on Flickr?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.040]   - I did, where did I post them?
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.120]   I posted one on Google Plus.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.200]   - Another Google Plus, sir.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.040]   - Money is garden, I took a picture of me.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.120]   You know, money, the painter?
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.280]   - Yeah, you went to a little family.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.320]   - Yeah, so I went to his house and took some photos.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.360]   And I took one particular one using the HDR Pro,
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   and I was so delighted with it.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.160]   I posted that on Google Plus.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.080]   - I think I'm not following you on Google Plus.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.760]   Is that possible?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.520]   Let's go there and find out.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.160]   - So I'm not offended, it's okay.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.640]   - Well, it's a total oversight because I'm there.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.480]   Look at that.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.160]   This is done with the iPhone 4?
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.120]   - That was the iPhone 4.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.760]   Handheld shot using--
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.120]   - Holy cow.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.640]   - Yeah, fantastic.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.040]   - I mean, the clarity and detail,
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.600]   even of the people in the distance on Monet's bridge,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   the Japanese bridge are just amazing.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.440]   - I actually--
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.800]   - Leo, I've just sent you that photo.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.520]   - Oh good, thank you, Andy.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.560]   Thank you, I'll take a look at it.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.880]   Well anyway, I think there's no question that Apple
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.200]   will absolutely pay attention to the camera
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   on the iPhone 4, next gen or whatever we call it.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.320]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.440]   Aaron Hilligast is here from Big Nerd Ranch,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.840]   without his cowboy hat, you might not have recognized him.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.520]   I didn't even know you had all that hair though.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.880]   - Yeah, still for a while longer.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   (laughing)
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.960]   - The hat hasn't caused it all to fall out, apparently.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.120]   Aaron does great iPhone training at Big Nerd Ranch,
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.680]   iPhone, iOS and Cocoa training.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.160]   In fact, you really started with Cocoa training now,
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.400]   Android training as well.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   I always wanted to do the Cocoa workshop.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.960]   I have your Cocoa book and I love it.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.880]   In fact, thanks to you, I have the new iOS book,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.840]   which is also great.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.080]   - I need to get your copy of our advanced
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.120]   Mac OS 10 programming.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.360]   - Oh, yes, someday.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.960]   I'm not quite advanced yet.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.200]   Don McAllister also from ScreenCasts online,
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.320]   a great place to learn software.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.600]   ScreenCastsOnline.com
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.760]   and of course, Andy Anako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.560]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   Makers of go to meeting now with HD Faces.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.640]   I have to tell you, go to meeting for a long time
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.760]   has been the way we have held meetings.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.480]   First of all, it's very easy to set up.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.120]   You just click the link and it sends out an email,
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.600]   it adds an invitation to people's calendars.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.400]   It gives them a link they can click to go to the meeting,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.240]   see your screen.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   So if you're doing a sales presentation or whatever,
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.320]   and even if they don't have it installed,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.880]   actually especially if they don't have it installed,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.320]   go to meeting as a great solution,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.280]   because they click the link,
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.720]   it says we're gonna install the software,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.560]   you allow it 'cause it's a little Java in 30 seconds.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.080]   It's very quick, it's installed and there it is,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.800]   it's working, they're seeing your screen and now,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.200]   they're seeing you and you're seeing them.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.600]   And I have to tell you, HD Faces makes a huge difference
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.440]   in the quality of your meetings to see the reactions
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.920]   people have, whether they're nodding or frowning,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.800]   whether their arms are folded or they're open,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.880]   it just makes a big difference in terms of sales,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.520]   collaboration, training, preparation.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   I've used it for rehearsals, we use it all the time
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.760]   for meetings.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.320]   So here's how you can try it free right now.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.000]   Visit gotomeeting.com, click the orange,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.440]   try it free button, and when they ask you for the offer code,
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.280]   please use Macbreak as your offer code.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.640]   Go to meeting.com, try it free button,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.040]   Macbreak is the offer code.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   And then if you want, just to get an idea,
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.720]   take a look at the video they've got on that page,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.240]   it demonstrates HD Faces.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.160]   The quality is this good.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.120]   It is really good.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.480]   If your Metis have webcams and internet access,
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.280]   and if they're in the office, usually they have great bandwidth,
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.520]   it just is incredible.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.360]   Up to six people on this page, in the meeting,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.880]   you're seeing them, you can rearrange the screen
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   and the photo images, the video images
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.680]   so that you can make it convenient.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.360]   Of course, you can zoom the screen out and so forth.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.520]   And it's so easy to do.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.840]   They don't even need to do a phone call.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.440]   They can just use VoIP built in to go to meeting to do this.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.560]   You could see it's just the best way to meet.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.200]   Go to meeting.com, use the offer code, Macbreak
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   to try it free for 30 days.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.640]   And we thank Citrix, those great folks at Citrix,
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.400]   for their support of all of our shows.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.520]   Really good friends and good company
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.440]   and good fellows to be partnered with.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.080]   Moving along, we mentioned briefly
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.200]   that the build conference is going on right now.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.000]   I know this is Macbreak Weekly, but Microsoft
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.600]   is taking the covers off of the next version of Windows.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.320]   Windows 8, at least that's the code name.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.000]   It's been so far, we don't know what the final name would be.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.200]   And I'm told that this afternoon they
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.880]   will hand out the Windows developer preview
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.240]   to all of the attendees.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.160]   These are hardware software developers
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.080]   who are working on Windows.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.520]   And Andy, you've watched the keynote I know.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.440]   It's clearly, they're heavily influenced by the iPad.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.680]   Yes and no.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.520]   What I really like about what they've
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.200]   done with Windows 8 is that they've
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.600]   been influenced in the sense that they said that, you know
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   what, that instant on thing, that works great.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.520]   We should try that.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.800]   You know what, multi-touch everywhere, that's great.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.320]   We should try that.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.800]   And nonetheless though, they have gone--
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.560]   they had said an app store in which things are sort of sandbox
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.040]   and things are designed so that they're
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.240]   been checked out and consumers can really trust them.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   Also, great idea.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.240]   We should totally do that.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.160]   But they are going--
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.520]   I'm not going to go so far as to say one step further.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.360]   But they're using that to sort of fuel what I think
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.120]   are their own ideas on what an X generation operating system
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.160]   should look like.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.400]   Because it's just as significant from all the deviations
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.240]   they've made.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.200]   Chief among them, the idea that we are not
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.760]   going to have a separate tablet operating system
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.720]   separate from our desktop operating system.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.380]   What we're going to have is a way to articulate a really
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.360]   cool, multi-touch experience when it's appropriate for the user
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.000]   to have a multi-touch experience.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.840]   But it's going to work alongside a conventional desktop
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.640]   experience.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.640]   So as a result, you can have a very like iPad looking, slim
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.280]   little tablet that looks slick as anything.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.560]   I love the Metro interface.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.880]   But nonetheless, it's still running Windows underneath it
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.920]   so that if you come home and you attach a keyboard
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.680]   and a mouse to it, it will behave like a regular desktop.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:10.280]   Because it's just an AMD based or Intel based processor.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.520]   Or ARM based apparently.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.480]   That's the--
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.280]   They're going to do AMD Intel and ARM.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.760]   Exactly.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.960]   So that's possible now maybe to have the best of all three
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.120]   worlds.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.720]   Apple's traditional explanation has been that, well, you can't
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.960]   really take a desktop operating system and make it mobile
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.560]   because it makes too many power demands.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.720]   It won't run--
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.360]   and if you use a cheap processor that will run in low power
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.600]   mode, it won't be powerful enough to run real app.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.720]   So it's best to have two separate entities.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.280]   The hardware that they showed off today, which
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.680]   ranged from a two-year-old netbook running Windows 8,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.560]   all the way up to huge like Golgotha shaped machines
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.120]   with a water-cooled tower with 840 mega giga teraflops
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.160]   that becomes self-aware three seconds after you turn it on.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.400]   All running the same operating system.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.680]   The question is going to be, though, is they all look great.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.320]   They look smooth.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.080]   They look interactive.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.320]   They look so good that I really can't
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.440]   wait to get my hands on actual functioning hardware
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.680]   to say, well, it works.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.600]   But the real question is, if you're running Windows 8
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.480]   on a little $400, $500 tablet, will it run as well as this
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.720]   dedicated mobile-only operating system
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.320]   runs on the iPad?
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.640]   And also, I got to say--
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.600]   I think you could say safely that it will not.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.840]   I mean, the iPad--
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.480]   So well--
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.440]   So finely tuned.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.680]   It's like that specific thing.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.400]   And you can't write general-purpose software
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.240]   and glom into that hardware.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.480]   Well, you can't--
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   It's possible that you can.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.080]   I think I'm not--
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.040]   realize that right now, all we're looking at is the very first
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.080]   developer preview.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.280]   This is the first time in which people can actually
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   start writing apps for it.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.120]   So we're not anywhere close to a consumer release yet.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.560]   But the demo they gave was all live-fire demos.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.600]   It all looked really, really good.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.520]   And remember that the one advantage
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.240]   that the PC marketplace has always had
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.400]   is the ability to make dirt cheap hardware.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.960]   So if there is any company that can make a decent $500 tablet,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.560]   I think it is this Windows community.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.280]   And remember, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.160]   There's so many really cool ideas here.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.920]   One idea that I absolutely--
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.080]   I'll talk about two ideas I really, really love about it.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.800]   One is that you have apps that can articulate themselves
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   in multiple different ways depending on the situation.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.480]   So you don't have a start bar anymore.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.880]   You have a start screen.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.840]   And your apps that you're running and the apps that
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.160]   are still dormant can actually just
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.040]   be little tiles that do nothing more than kind of like how
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.000]   apps in the dock can badge themselves to say, oh,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.280]   by the way, you've got 41 emails waiting for you.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.480]   Only can be a lot more complicated and the sort of stuff
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.400]   they can show you.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.080]   You tap it and it becomes a full screen app.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   That works great.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.280]   Or if you want to watch a movie but you
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   want to keep an eye on what's going on in your mailbox,
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.080]   you can actually rearticulate the email app
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.280]   as just a little sidebar app that just
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   kind of like a mobile phone app.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.160]   That's just one big column in the side.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.800]   So you can actually have more than one app
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.840]   running at the same time but in a way that makes sense for mobile.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.160]   And the other thing, which I don't
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.480]   know how well it's going to work out.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.520]   It works great in a demo.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.600]   But I'm not sure how well it's going
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.680]   to work when you get millions of developers on this.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.840]   One point that came back to time and time again,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.400]   as frequently as they were talking about the idea
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.040]   of having multi-touch and having these nice little tiled
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.200]   interfaces, is the idea of having all apps working together
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.480]   as one pool of functions.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.680]   And it's such a slick concept where they have the pictures
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.160]   gallery, for instance.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.480]   And as we all know in iOS, our pictures gallery
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.760]   can send things via email via MMS, by a mobile me,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.320]   and in the new operating system.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.440]   It'll run via Twitter because Apple
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.600]   has been kind enough to hardware and support for these things.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.800]   Because of the nature of Windows 8,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.640]   if you have a Facebook client or Twitter client
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.440]   or an anything or a Reddit client or anything,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.680]   that app can be written with a couple of checkboxes
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.720]   and a few lines of code that says, oh, by the way,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.800]   I am capable of accepting pictures.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.720]   So if you are ever in-- so Windows 8 operating system,
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.760]   if you are ever showing the user a big library of pictures
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.080]   and you want to give this person options and want to do with them,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.120]   by all means throw my app in the list of things
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.320]   that can toss it to.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.040]   So I can be in the pictures gallery, tap on a button,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.840]   and then simply send it to my Twitter feeder,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.560]   send it to-- or post it to elsewhere,
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.800]   just by virtue of the fact that I happen to have another app
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   in there.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   It doesn't launch the other app.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.840]   It just simply embeds its import and export features
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.960]   into that second app.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.800]   And there are so many different ways that it articulates.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.920]   So this is all just a demo.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.000]   I'm going to be clear.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.160]   It's all just a demo.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.200]   But so many new generation mobile operating systems
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.080]   fail even at the demo stage.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.120]   I keep coming back to Android, where--
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.720]   dang it, they just got nothing going on on tablets.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.360]   They can give me a two-hour presentation,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.320]   which it looks like the only messages
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.400]   that we don't get how people are supposed to use a tablet
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.160]   in even the 21st century.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.000]   This is a demo that made me think, even in the middle of it,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.240]   I was like following up with the contacts I've got at Microsoft
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.960]   saying, yeah, how soon could I get some demo?
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.040]   They handed out 5,000 Samsung Series 7 tablets with i5s
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.680]   in them to the developers there.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.000]   You should have been at the Build Conference, Andy.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.840]   Actually, I don't know if they gave them away,
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.120]   because I was listening, and they said we have 5,000
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.680]   in a warehouse next door.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.200]   They didn't actually mention that.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.320]   But it really does come down to price.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.240]   If those are tablets that are going to cost 1,200 bucks,
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.760]   that's kind of a problem.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.360]   But if those are tablets, they're going to cost 500 or 600 bucks.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.800]   Or if they can have an $800 tablet that
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.200]   won't just sort of duplicate the use of a laptop
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.560]   in a conceptual way.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.840]   Oh, well, there's a mobile app that you can use,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   and as a word processor, kind of well enough.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.200]   If it's an $800 machine that will do the work of an $800
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.880]   laptop and a $500 tablet, the whole race
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.760]   just got really interesting.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.720]   I know.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.880]   So go ahead.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.320]   Go on.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.240]   I have sort of a cultural question about the whole thing.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.360]   And that is the one thing that we know Apple is good at.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.880]   And I am not a religious zealot on the Apple
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.480]   versus Microsoft question.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.160]   But one thing we know that Apple is good at
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.920]   is saying that's not something we're
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.520]   going to put on the device.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.400]   It's not something we're going to put in the operating system.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.880]   Do you think that Microsoft feeling
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.880]   the heat of the Apple sales, not just on the mobile devices,
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.280]   but also on the desktop and laptop devices
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.520]   that it has given them the fortitude to actually yank things
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.440]   out that are weighing it down?
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.040]   No.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.960]   I'll quote Robert Scoble on this,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.680]   because he used to work for Microsoft.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.520]   And he-- on his Google plus he posted this,
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.200]   he said, Microsoft's most important event yet.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.000]   He says, when he sees people, venture capitalists,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.280]   and entrepreneurs, they all are carrying max these days.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.040]   He says, this is Microsoft's last chance
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.800]   to grab this audience before it runs away.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.160]   But he says, Microsoft's problem.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.640]   And I think he's kind of right on this,
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.000]   is that they take great pride in the fact
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.640]   that software written in 1983 will run on Windows.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.000]   And that is something they're not going to leave behind.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.160]   And so what Robert points out-- he said,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.280]   and I admire him for this.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.800]   He said, demos are so easy.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.960]   Robert has been very guilty of this in the past,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.280]   as have many of us.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.640]   Very easy to look at a demo and get moved and get very excited.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.120]   He says, I'm going to withhold judgment on Windows 8
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.280]   until I have it in my hands.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.720]   I'm not going to let the demo sway me.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.480]   He says, but what I fear--
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.320]   and I think that this is a reasonable fear,
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.400]   given Microsoft's history-- is this great gloss on top.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.880]   And you dig down, and there's that ugly--
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.520]   those ugly Windows apps, that ugly Windowsness
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.480]   beneath the surface.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.240]   And that is going to-- he says that Microsoft
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.680]   has to get past that.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.760]   So to answer-- that's the problem that they face, right?
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.440]   That's absolutely true, because I was so with them
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.400]   for the first hour, and then they start
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.600]   digging a little bit deeper.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.260]   And they're showing-- and we've redone the task manager that
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.920]   actually-- they're showing some of the low power features
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.920]   that one of the things that Windows 8 does well
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.360]   is that it really shuts down apps that aren't doing anything
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.600]   or don't need the CPU so that things come on instantly
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.000]   and also doesn't burn up power that it doesn't need.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.720]   But also, so they're showing up-- they're, oh, we've also
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.200]   redone the task manager so that you can see percentages.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.000]   And so they do some sort of button click or whatever.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.800]   And now you're looking at that beautiful Metro interface
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.200]   in the background with this ugly Windows 7
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.320]   window on the top of it.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.280]   And now they're going to sort of the more technical stuff.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.720]   And now you're starting to see the start bar popping up
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.400]   over the Metro interface.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.680]   And you're seeing-- I was like, oh, god.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.800]   It really is like when you're at a really beautiful, elegant,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.040]   expensive family wedding.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.200]   And there's one drunk uncle who's grabbing the microphone
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.080]   and trying to sing Lily Marlon.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.960]   It's like, oh.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.680]   And that's the question.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.840]   Can Microsoft chuck that drunk uncle?
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.720]   I think that's really important.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.760]   This is the problem, isn't it?
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.120]   Sorry.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.640]   This is the problem that Microsoft have in that.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.200]   And I do feel sorry for them this respect,
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.720]   in that they are making the software platform.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   And they have little or no control over the hardware
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.880]   and the infrastructure.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.720]   And that's where Apple really has this huge advantage, not just
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.560]   over Microsoft, but over everybody else, in that they are
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.040]   solely and gradually building up this entire ecosystem
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   from mobile devices that go in your pocket,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.720]   from mobile devices that you use around the home, laptops,
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.960]   desktop machines.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.520]   And they're creating all the software that run on these platforms.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.120]   But they're actually creating the hardware platforms as well.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.400]   And they're also doing the back-end infrastructure.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.520]   And just a single software manufacturer who's just building
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.040]   a software platform can't really compete on that sort of level.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.680]   It's not a level playing field really, I feel.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.160]   That's true.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.040]   I think, Aaron, you would point out,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.920]   I'm sure that Apple's been able to leave its users in the dust many times.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.680]   Definitely.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.760]   They've taken away things that people thought they loved.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.840]   And then after a year or so, people realized they didn't love them so much.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.480]   And they have the nerve in the guts to do that.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.920]   And they had the nerves in the guts.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.800]   But Don has a good point in that graphics chips, in particular,
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.320]   everything that happens on the iPad is optimized for the graphics chips
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.440]   that are in there.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.960]   Whereas with Microsoft, they have to write to everything.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.880]   And by making it more agnostic about the graphics,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.800]   they don't get to leverage it as far.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.760]   And Android has had a terrible time with this.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.680]   They've been really slow to optimize the graphics for the hardware.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.440]   And you can really feel the difference when you scroll on an Android phone versus scrolling.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.160]   So is that to Don's point that because Android is like Microsoft,
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.800]   they don't control the hardware, they just control the software.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.080]   So Apple's real advantage is controlling the whole thing.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.280]   And that was the first thing Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.480]   Was he fired, he got rid of the clones.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.240]   He said, we will be the keeper of Apple hardware, period.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.480]   And he got rid of several product lines as well.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.320]   There were gazillions of different Macs at the time.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.240]   And he's like, no, we do three now.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.560]   We do the top level, we do the middle, and we do the bottom.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.000]   And that's a unity of purpose that has been an absolute through line.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.480]   And everything Apple's done since.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.320]   Exactly.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.880]   Andy, you say this all the time.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.000]   If it doesn't fit, they're not going to do it.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.240]   If it doesn't fit into this product chain, they're not going to do it.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.840]   That's what's part of what I think is so exciting about this.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.800]   It's really from a story point of view.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:03.760]   You don't like the story about how two people who are very, very similar and have very,
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.960]   very similar strengths play the game and one kind of one on points.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   Right.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.920]   Two great boxers, that's kind of interesting.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.280]   A boxer fighting a hockey player, that's really interesting.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   That's when he starts thinking about these people have two totally different ideas on
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.360]   how to do a mobile operating system.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:31.000]   I wonder which one will prove to be successful once they start putting players into the field.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.880]   Although I should backtrack that on the point of graphics acceleration, they did during
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.840]   the keynote make a stress point that we are taking all like graphics acceleration in
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.800]   house that's all being handled by the operating system in Windows 8.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.280]   So that in theory, or at least the way they explained it, that whether your app is deploying
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:56.200]   on a netbook with software acceleration or the big gargantuan machine with 41 graphics
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.560]   cards installed that you don't have to support anything, we will handle all that in the operating
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.560]   system.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   No details were explained, but that's one of the applause points from the developers there.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.920]   We'll have a lot to say, a lot more to say about Windows 8 on Thursday.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:17.480]   We will have Mary Jofoli and Paul Therat, who are at Build, live from Build Thursday at
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.240]   11 AM Pacific 2PM Eastern for Windows Weekly and that's where we'll really go in great
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   depth.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.560]   By then, I think they will have both played as well as will their co-hosts and I think
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   we'll have some people from Microsoft.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.680]   They will have played with Windows 8 for some time, but then they'll have a better sense
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.720]   of what's going on.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.920]   It's certainly, I agree with you Andy, it's fun to watch these two slug it out and they're
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.640]   coming from completely different points of strength.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.080]   And so as a result, it's more than just a battle of equals.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   And I think that's, I think I agree with you.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.080]   I think it's fun.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.120]   It's really like democracy versus communism all over again.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.880]   Only with a company that might actually be able to make communism work.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.200]   I'm going to ask who's who.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.160]   Hey, we're going to take a break, come back with more including the responsive one Android
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.080]   phone maker saying, "Oh, iPhones aren't cool because dads use them."
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.600]   But we'll, I'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.400]   First I want to tell you how you could focus on your work and not your paperwork, how
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.640]   you can get paid faster with invoicing that is so fresh.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.440]   I'm talking about freshbooks.com.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.800]   I'll tell you, if you are a freelancer and you have to send out invoices, I know the
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.400]   end of the month is painful.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   It always was for me.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.760]   It wasn't that it was that hard.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   It just, it just wasn't fun.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.960]   It wasn't interesting.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.320]   And yet that's, that's key to getting paid.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.760]   Sometimes I would just delay it and that's not a good idea.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.480]   Fresh books turned my life around.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   Amber MacArthur told me about them in 2004.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.760]   I started using them, never looked back.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.920]   What a great way to do your invoices.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.520]   You upload your logo.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.320]   So these invoices look professional.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.560]   They look great.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.000]   They can email, be emailed as well as mailed.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I like that.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.560]   Now I would, with some of my clients, I still gave them a paper invoice.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.720]   And FreshBooks does that too.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.840]   They'll print it, stamp it, mail it for you for an additional fee.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.640]   But, but for some of my clients, just the email was great, especially because the Fresh
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:07.320]   Books email has a button on it that says, "Pay your bill now."
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.240]   And that means that your clients can use a credit card.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   They can use PayPal.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.400]   They can use authorized dinette to pay that invoice immediately.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.840]   You know how many people actually just do it?
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.600]   It's not that they don't want to pay you or they don't have the money.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.120]   It's just a pain for them to pay the invoices as it was for you to make it.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.000]   This just friction-free commerce.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.160]   In fact, you can even have automatic invoices sent out, which I love, and automatic payment
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   set up.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.880]   So it just happens.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.600]   If they don't pay, of course, they've got great hassle-free invoice follow-up, easy
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   to create good looking invoices.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.440]   And if you do time and billing, if you keep track of your hours, they have an iPhone app
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.160]   and a web app.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.720]   And the data from that, the hours that you've kept all month, automatically go right into
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.120]   the invoice, which makes it very, very simple.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.360]   I just think you're going to love it.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.120]   I want you to take a look at it.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.600]   In fact, what's great is it's free for your first three clients.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.120]   So go to freshbooks.com, freshbooks.com.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.640]   Try it absolutely free for the first three.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   And of course, you can get more up to 25 clients for $20 a month and on and on.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.000]   It's very, very affordable.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.400]   Freshbooks.com, and yes, they're still giving away birthday cakes to Mac Break listeners.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.560]   It doesn't have to be your birthday to win a cake.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.800]   So every week they'll give away a free birthday cake to everybody who signed up that week.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   So make sure you mention.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:37.720]   I heard it on Mac Break Weekly when you go to freshbooks.com, invoicing made simple,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   painless billing.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:45.320]   For them, I, for that I love them and will always love them like a brother.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   HTC.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.680]   I love this.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.360]   Is barely in the market to buy a new operating system.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.120]   Maybe Android isn't making it for them.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.840]   They make by the way, among the best Android phones, the HTC sensation is fantastic.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   It's beautiful.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.440]   But HTC President, the US President, Martin Fittcher, or Fittor was at the Mobile Future
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.760]   Forward Conference in Seattle.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:14.800]   He said, "Kids and teenagers don't want iPhones anymore because dads have them."
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.200]   I brought my daughter back to college.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.840]   She's down in Portland at Reed.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.480]   Steve Jobs, alma mater, by the way.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.520]   And I talked to a few of the kids on her floor.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:27.840]   None of them has an iPhone because they told me my dad has an iPhone.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.720]   This guy, admittedly, wants to sell more HTC phones.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.960]   But they may not be running Android much longer.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.760]   There's a rumor afoot that HTC might be actually going to HP and talking about picking up that
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   web OS.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   I don't know if that means they would stop making Android phones.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.200]   As I said, they make some of the best.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.560]   In fact, they made the first Android phone, the first Google phone, the G1, was an HTC
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   phone.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   But they make Windows phones as well.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   I mean, they're very agnostic.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   That's a good point.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.880]   But anybody's operating system on it is a little buy it.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.720]   It wouldn't be exclusive, necessarily.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.000]   I'd love to see somebody who really know how to make hardware by WebOS.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Because that's really been the problem.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.160]   WebOS, the pre was underpowered.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.880]   Even the touchpad really felt sluggish running WebOS.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:19.560]   If somebody made some good hardware, I thought WebOS was a very elegant operating system.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.360]   You don't think that's inherent in HTML5 and Web Apps in general?
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.360]   I don't know.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   Apple runs HTML5 pretty well.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.680]   I mean, you know better than I do.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.840]   Do you think a native iOS app is better than an HTML5?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   I do.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.480]   I believe that native apps are a little more responsive.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.440]   I think the user experience is better.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   I mean, HTML5 keeps getting better.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.400]   And JavaScript programmers keep getting more and more clever.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.160]   But in the end, native is always going to be faster.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.680]   I guess that makes sense because it's compiled.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   Yeah, it's compiled.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.920]   On the iPhone, is it running in a virtual machine like Android?
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.640]   Or is it running "Bear to the Metal"?
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   On the--
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   On iOS.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   Object to see.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   It's the Metal.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.040]   So it compiles down to assembly.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.560]   Yeah, OK.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.160]   So yeah, it would be faster, of course.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.680]   I guess you could optimize quite a bit on JavaScript.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   But it's never going to be fast.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.680]   It's going to be amazing things with JavaScript.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.080]   But it is still just an interpreted scripting language.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:16.000]   Actually in a related story, Adobe is putting HTML5 video support in Flash Media Server.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   That means if you're running as we are Flash Media Server, normally that encodes the video
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.720]   that you're watching into Flash.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.720]   So most of you who are watching our live video on the web, watch it in a Flash window at
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.680]   Justin TV or BitGravity or Ustream.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.800]   But if you're watching on a Roku box, if you're watching on iOS, as many of you do,
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.600]   you're watching H.264.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.200]   And now Flash Media Server will support that.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.720]   So that means I guess more and more people will be making HTML5 video.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.240]   I mean, why wouldn't they?
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.640]   Because it plays on everything, including iOS.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.200]   And you want to be on iOS.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   Definitely.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.360]   Yeah, there was a lot of misinformation on the web when that announcement was made.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.280]   People thought Flash was actually coming to the iPhone.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.560]   But it is actually a transport stream, isn't it?
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.480]   The server is actually transmitting it in a form that can be captured by iOS devices soon.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.720]   It's something called HLS or HTTP Live Streaming Protocol.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.680]   And in fact, I should make this announcement because it's HLS that's required, for instance,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.920]   to watch us live on a Roku box or on your popcorn hour, your Visio TV.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:30.800]   And we just now, all of our partners now are doing HLS interesting, isn't it?
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:36.400]   And we have a really, I think, high quality HLS stream going out thanks to Ustream.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.000]   We send them one and a half megabit video, which is pretty high quality.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And then their player will automatically size it according to your bandwidth.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Now we are back.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.280]   And I was just asking before the show, and I didn't hear, is anybody watching us live
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:55.040]   on the Roku box because I understand live playback on Roku is now working?
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.520]   So that, you know, speaking as somebody who puts out streaming video, you're doing well,
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.880]   better play on an iPhone or iPad.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   That's going to be half of your platform.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.000]   Well, as someone who does development, people were coming to me and they were saying, well,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.480]   we really need to get this flash stuff on to the iMac or whatever.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.560]   And Apple was sort of deprecating, and it was really Apple and Adobe going toe to toe.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.320]   And it looks like with this announcement, Apple's won.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   Yay.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   And I think rightly so.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.680]   I think flash sucks, just to be honest.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.040]   I mean, it's 99% CPU.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.240]   I've been on a desktop computer.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.640]   It crashes all the time.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.720]   There have been huge security issues with flash.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.720]   And we need an open standard.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:44.160]   It's probably not going to be H.264, but that's, I think, what you're seeing now.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.480]   It'll eventually, I presume, be WebM, which is the video format that Google has thrown
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.280]   its weight behind.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   Andy, you're going to see it.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:57.120]   I was just going to say that you got to think that this move from Adobe is simply the last
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:02.560]   step from a long chain that started with all flash developers saying, we need access
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   to iOS devices.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.040]   You're tactic of saying, well, the iPad is a deficient device because it'll have flash,
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.640]   we should intimidate Apple into adopting flash.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   Was not working.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.960]   The idea of trying to stymie it as a streaming video device also was stymie.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.240]   So they would have continued to press that point if they thought that they had any reasonable
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.440]   success at getting at it.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.400]   This is their way of saying, okay, we're never going to convince Apple to do what we
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.560]   want them to do.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.080]   We are never going to make our point that flash should be ported to this thing.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.080]   They're going to have to.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.840]   And also the iPad and iOS devices are important enough devices that we are going to have to
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.880]   support it on our end if we're going to make sure that our developers are able to get their
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.160]   content on those devices.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:50.680]   So that's definitely another point in someone's golf scorecard and Apple about, yep, we want
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   another one.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   We will.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.080]   I think there's also the impact that the last releases of all the Android tablets that
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:00.920]   have been, because a lot of them in touted as being, they will run flash.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.760]   But virtually every review that I've seen, yes, they do run flash, but they run it really
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.240]   slowly and it's buggy and it's really not a credible solution.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.760]   So not only is this going to fix the problem for iOS devices, it's going to fix the problem
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.080]   for Android tablets as well.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.920]   Here's a trivia question for you.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.280]   What do Yale University, MIT, University of California at Berkeley and the University of
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.960]   South Florida all have in common?
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.360]   I can see over your shoulders.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.320]   I know it's the attitude to you.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:35.680]   They all have more than 20 million downloads each on iTunes U. This is from the JIMMADal
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.840]   Rimple writing loop insight.com.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.360]   iTunes U now has more than 600 million downloads since it launched in 2007.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.680]   For the first couple of years of iTunes U, I think nobody knew about it.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   It was one of those things where if you were at a university, it was like their portal
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.480]   to iTunes, a special version.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.520]   But half of those 600 million downloads have happened in the last year alone.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.720]   So that tells me people are learning about iTunes U.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.560]   And it is the best deal in education out there.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   It's amazing.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.480]   It really is an incredible democratization of learning.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.400]   You don't have to go to university to go to university classes.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:15.080]   Not surprising that MIT, UCB and Yale are in that 20 million group because they put a
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.320]   lot of their course where on Stanford and not to take away from Big Nerd Ranch, which
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.320]   does the best training.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.680]   But Stanford has their famous iOS course.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.440]   They update that every year.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.000]   You can go, you can watch every lecture that every Stanford kid is going to see the same
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   thing.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.240]   You're going to even get the course, the workbook, the problem assignments, all of that.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   And they update it every year.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.020]   I mean, if you wanted to learn iOS and you didn't have the money to go to Big Nerd Ranch,
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.480]   or maybe you wanted to get a good head start, that's an amazing thing.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   It really is.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.720]   I mean, of course, it breaks my heart to talk about it.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.160]   But it's a wonderful thing that it's a good thing.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.120]   No, no, because there's nothing like having an instructor.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.360]   I think this is one of the things that keeps universities alive.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.720]   I think what it does is redefine the mission of the university because you can get the
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.000]   information Alex Lindsey is always saying this.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.200]   Make one video of the best lecture that you gave, make it, and show it every year, and
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.640]   then don't do it ever again.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.400]   And then the university becomes about face to face, about talking about coliculae.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.560]   And that's what you do really well.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.560]   So I think that I don't think this hurts you at all.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.560]   Exactly.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.480]   It's about creating a community where people can go and learn and creating an environment
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   where you really get to concentrate on what you're learning, which is what the big nerd
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   ranch does.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.200]   The top two universities are open university.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.240]   I don't know what that is, and Stanford University.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.040]   They both have more than 30 million downloads.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:35.080]   And I have to think that that Stanford iOS course is probably the number one download
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:42.680]   on iTunes U. It is, yep, 30 percent of iTunes U traffic comes from iOS devices.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.760]   iTunes U in 123 countries.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.720]   And I think one of the big changes Apple made is now you can actually, you didn't, you'd
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.480]   had to know about it before.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.880]   It is actually in iTunes now.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.120]   You can, if I launch iTunes, I can show you.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.680]   Well, you know, you've probably seen it now.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.440]   There actually is an iTunes U tab in iTunes.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.160]   And if you haven't checked it out, just amazing.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.920]   A course is on philosophy, literature, history.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.840]   It's not all tech stuff.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.920]   It's mostly not tech stuff.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.040]   I just think it's really great.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.160]   iTunes U would go to the App Store, click iTunes U, and you get an idea of the big variety
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.640]   of stuff.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:25.280]   The number one course right now, Oxford University, critical reasoning.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.040]   Course is an entrepreneurship, critical reasoning for beginners.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   Hm.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.880]   Hi, I need that.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   Wow.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   Isn't that cool?
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.760]   And that's all free.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.960]   Just the nature of argument, different types of argument.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.560]   Oh, I would love to.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.200]   This is like a rhetoric class.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.760]   Are you confident you can reason clearly?
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.040]   Are you able to convince others of your point of view?
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.320]   Are you able to give plausible reasons for believing what you believe?
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   This is great.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:58.480]   And a point just to kudos to all these universities for putting this stuff online.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.440]   They've got to feel like it threatens them a little bit to make this stuff away for free.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.400]   I'm astonished they pour so much into this effort of producing these films and making
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.800]   them available for free because I would feel threatened.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:14.000]   Well, I'm privy a little bit to what Yale did because I was on a committee for the digitization
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   of Yale's resources or something like that.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.520]   That was an advisory committee along with people like Mitch Capore and Rob Glatier and a bunch
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.160]   of Yale alums advising the president.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.680]   And the mission was how do we get-- Yale's mission is to give its stuff away.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:33.280]   How do we get all the stuff that we have, the library, the museums, the courseware?
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.800]   How do we get it on the internet so that anybody can participate?
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   So I think universities take seriously their mission to disseminate information as opposed
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.200]   to make money.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.480]   Good universities do anyway.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   That was really cool.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:51.320]   One of the initiatives was this open courseware initiative that they were doing of Yale courses.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   And they really didn't want to just-- sometimes you'll see some of the-- like MIT, I think
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.160]   they want to put everything online so they just have a kind of a quick and dirty video
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   of it.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.080]   Yale wanted it, edited with close-ups and wide shots and all the courseware.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:08.720]   They really wanted to make it something that was really appealing so they picked 10 of the
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.080]   best courses every year to put out on there.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.120]   And so I think that's worked quite well for them.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.440]   But everybody's got a different point of view.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:23.200]   I'm just-- it just to me, I think this is the promise of digital technology.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:28.480]   Has-- okay, I know you're an NDA and you can't talk about anything, Aaron.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.400]   Have you played with iTunes Match at all?
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.200]   I can't talk about that.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   Damn!
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:42.520]   Apparently, they're expanding the iTunes Match beta test for US developers.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.480]   We're well-made demand-caused Apple to shut the program down.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.600]   The developers like it.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.200]   This is the thing that lets you match your even stolen music.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.600]   Yeah, let's see.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   That's exactly the problem.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.840]   They didn't anticipate how long it would take to write all those subpoenas back by the
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   Iron Man.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:58.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.040]   No word, they'll have it totally-- they'll be totally up to speed in October.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.240]   Any of your songs including music you've imported from CDs or stolen from Napster.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.720]   That matches with the 18 million songs in the iTunes store will be available in the iCloud
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:19.200]   and playback at iTunes Plus quality, 256 kilobits DRM-free AAC, even if your original was 56 kilobits.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.200]   MP3.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.200]   I want it!
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   $25.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   I want it.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:29.000]   I just really hope they haven't underestimated the demand if the developer reaction was anything
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   to go by.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.280]   Well, it's telling them that maybe a lot of people will be doing this.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   It's not streaming.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.040]   Oh, you can't talk about it at all.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   Sounds awesome.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:48.840]   From what I read about an Apple insider, the details I've read that have been posted publicly
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   on TUTO.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.120]   That's too an odd quote.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:58:01.400]   John Pachowski writing for all things D says, "Lion keeps Mac sales roaring."
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   This is from NPD.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:10.440]   Mac sales are up 22% last two months putting Apple on track to sell between 4.4 and 4.6
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.840]   million Macs in the quarter.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:21.240]   That would be, if it's true, the best quarter ever again for Macintosh sales.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.880]   This is the story that you don't hear very much about.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.720]   Everyone makes such a big deal about the iOS devices.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:32.680]   The MacBook Air is just a wonderful, beautiful device for most people's computer needs to
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.080]   be able to get on the internet, edit a document, edit a photo.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.920]   It's a perfect, perfect computer.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.640]   I'm kind of, I'll be honest, I was excited about the iPad.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.800]   I bought the iPad and I bought the iPad too, but I use it less than I thought it would
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.520]   because of the air.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.480]   The air is so much faster.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.240]   This is what I carry with me.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.240]   It folds up.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.480]   It's durable.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.240]   My wife actually is here in studio.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.440]   She ran the car over it and her MacBook Air is just fine.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.760]   You're kidding.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.920]   You ran the car over it and it worked.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   Your son is going back to the counter again.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.400]   You ran over it with the car.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.240]   There's a little argument ensuing here between your son and your wife.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.600]   Yes, but he's telling you.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   No, you ran over it, Mom.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.920]   You ran over it with the car.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   What's your son's name?
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   That's Walden.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   Walden, come here, Walden.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.240]   What's your other son's name?
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   That's Otto.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.240]   Otto, come here too.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   Come here.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.240]   Walden.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   Do you get this true story here?
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   What really happened?
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.000]   Walden, talk to the dad's microphone.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   What happened is...
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.160]   Come a little closer to the mic.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:46.720]   So we were at a hotel and we have a minivan and she leaned the bag that I was in along
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:52.120]   with the old Mac that is broken now.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:56.600]   She leaned that against the wheel and then she opened up the back door and the door came
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.720]   over the wheel so then she couldn't see it.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:06.000]   Then she closed the door and got it in the car and she backed up and then laid her investigation
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.400]   and found out that the car ran over it.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.560]   There's a tear in the bag.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.560]   And that's all, it still worked.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   Yes.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560]   That's truly amazing.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.960]   But the other thing didn't...
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.360]   The old MacBook did not.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.920]   The old MacBook went...
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.000]   The hardware worked.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.960]   The screen got broken.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.320]   But it's interesting that the air screamed at me.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.120]   I see people complimenting my Lego T-shirt.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.080]   Oh, well let's talk about your Lego T-shirt.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.840]   This is the Ascentive Man, isn't it?
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.800]   In Lego form.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.920]   So a year ago we went to Legoland in San Diego.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   Isn't that great?
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   I love Legoland.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.160]   I'm going back there soon.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.400]   I love Legoland.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.440]   And Anna, what is your T-shirt?
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   Well, it's a penguin with a boob box.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   A boob box penguin.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   Cool.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.480]   Is that a statement about Linux in any way?
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   I don't really know.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   No.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.120]   Nice to meet you, Otto.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.560]   Thank you for being on the show.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.960]   We'll send you...
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.120]   It's Walden and Otto.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.520]   I love those names.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520]   Thanks.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.520]   Walden and Otto Hilligas.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.520]   Once you name the first one, Walden.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.320]   I think she was so chagrin, she's disappeared.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.640]   You can't name the next one, Mike.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.840]   Oh, she's taking a picture of them on camera.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.360]   We'll send you a videotape for only $9.95, just right for a transcript.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360]   So cute.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.600]   So did the kids play with Lego and Lego Mindstorms?
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600]   Big Lego fans.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.440]   Yeah, we have the Mindstorms NXT.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.560]   You know, I'm just thinking that if we put edges on this table, this would make a great
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.840]   Lego work table.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   It would.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.640]   You would have a Lego show.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.640]   This week in Lego.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.640]   Oh, dear.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640]   We don't Lego rumors.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.400]   Wouldn't it be good?
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   Lego rumors.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   What am I thinking?
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.120]   I missed the boat doing all this tech stuff.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.000]   We should be doing Lego.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   Let us see.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.280]   I'm just going to quickly run through other top stories and we can get you your picks of
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   the week.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   So we did the business insider story about the company.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.720]   We don't know what the company is.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.520]   A very quote successful iPad app who talked about what it was like getting the iPad to
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.800]   ahead of time so that they could make sure that their app worked on it.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.320]   He says, I was probably the sixth person to get an iPad.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.680]   We had two of them flown out.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.360]   The criteria was we had to have a room with no windows.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.680]   They changed the locks on the doors.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.280]   Three developers and I were the only people allowed to go into the room.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.000]   Apple needed the names and social security numbers of everybody who had access.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.240]   They drilled a hole in the desk and chained the devices to the desk.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.400]   But here's the part I love.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.560]   They had custom wooden frames built around the iPads so that all you could see was the
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.320]   screen.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.600]   You couldn't tell what it looked like.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.600]   We could plug into them so we could code and we could touch the screen and play with that.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.480]   But we couldn't see the form factor.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.260]   And this is the other good detail.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.360]   It took pictures of the wood grain of the table.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:06.400]   So if any pictures escaped into the wild, they could identify what desk it came from.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   Apple is like that.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.520]   It's incredibly secretive company.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.000]   And sometimes to their detriment.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.640]   I'm astonished at what efforts they got through.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.080]   I think so.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.680]   If look, you have a chance to be on the new iPad with an app that's going to launch.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.240]   And they say, will you do that?
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   You're going to say, yes.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   Sure.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.620]   In fact, even if I didn't have an app, I'd say.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:30.620]   I'll work inside the safe.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.620]   What can I do?
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.620]   What can I do?
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:34.620]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.620]   Have you experienced that, Aaron, yourself?
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:38.140]   I have run into the secrecy factor.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.540]   I have not actually ever gotten any secret hardware beforehand.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.540]   No.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.460]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:52.500]   Apple, top's JD power customer satisfaction survey as they have time and time again.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.840]   This is for smartphones.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.360]   Apple with out of 850 points, 838.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   Besting the next, the number two by a considerable amount, HTC was 801.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.560]   The industry averaged 788.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.560]   Look at the bottom there.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.680]   Well below industry average.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.640]   Samsung Motorola RIM LG Palm.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.200]   And at the very bottom, Nokia.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.560]   But this sort of satisfaction is creating a halo effect for all the products, I think.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.560]   People love Apple.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.180]   Because there's a huge halo effect.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.900]   Not so good for RIM and Nokia.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:32.620]   But you know, I remember Steve Jobs when he announced the iPhone way back when in 2007,
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.380]   saying how dissatisfied people were.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.140]   And I remember us talking about this, Andy.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.220]   How dissatisfied people were with smartphones to date.
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:42.660]   And remember, we were all saying, yeah, we all hate our blackberries and our other
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:47.340]   smartphones because there's so much promise there and they just are not usable.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:54.360]   Apple, I think, was the first company that decided to treat their, treat their iPhone
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.600]   cut their phone customers as human beings worthy of compassion and respect.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.300]   Well, the other because the other phone makers were really, they thought their customers
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.400]   were the networks, the AT&T and the Verizon.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400]   Yeah, they were very interesting.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.100]   And Apple, I mean, treated like the customers were the people who were going to be holding
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.100]   the phones.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.100]   Amazing.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.900]   And the customers were network users.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.980]   And so therefore, the solution almost saying anything was pushing another service to them.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.660]   Really the only thing that, and this sort of spoke a little bit to the lack of complexity
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.660]   of the phones that there were.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:32.180]   The only thing that you could do for a customer was come in, we'll swap out your phone, we'll
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:35.580]   charge you $50, we'll extend your contract two years because you asked for service and
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:36.940]   we'll send you out again.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:42.460]   So really, I mean, it's sort of like saying that we switch from an industry in which you
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:48.660]   get kicked in the butt or some other sensitive place for as a result of giving them 30,
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:54.180]   40, $50 a month to a customer to a company that will let you sit in their air conditioning,
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:57.500]   enjoy their Wi-Fi, do everything but give you a latte.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.060]   And now we're surprised that because consumers are actually responding to that.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.660]   I think the really big question is will the other companies respond to that and sort of
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.660]   up their game?
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.060]   I don't think they will because they just don't have the sort of infrastructure.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:13.260]   A couple of things to go ahead with the iPhone as well.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.260]   Sorry.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.260]   No, go ahead.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.780]   The thing with the iPhone is one that sort of opened the floodgates for me because I used
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.860]   to hate Bill Balforn's before the iPhone.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.860]   I used to have just a knock at your brick phone I used for phone calls and the thing was one
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.860]   they were really complicated.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.220]   I mean, I'm a techie so, you know, it shouldn't really have bothered me but they were just
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.660]   so hard to use but also there was always this fear of yes, you can get onto the internet
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:37.380]   with a phone but it's so horrendously expensive and that really put me off as well because
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.740]   I knew that if I did get a phone that I could get onto the internet where I'd use it more
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.060]   than I should do and run a huge bills.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.540]   And then the iPhone came along, made it simple but also the master stroke.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.460]   They made it simple to get onto the internet and they made it cheap to get onto the internet
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.940]   and then people had no, there was no barrier there and I've actually using your handheld
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:58.100]   device not just as a phone but as an internet communicator as he called it in the keynote.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:02.340]   And I think that was one of the real major breakthroughs that Apple made with the iPhone
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.980]   was that they worked down at the people were frightened of using the internet on their
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.140]   phones because of the expense and took that barrier away.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:15.300]   Yeah, there's a really great basic instructions, a comic strip did one about about the iPhone
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.020]   where he's saying, you know, I don't know why the iPhone people like Bragg about their
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.260]   about theirs being first.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:25.340]   I had this phone called a trio and it it to played videos that gave me email, it surfed
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:30.060]   the web and ran apps and did them in a way that the iPhone almost never does badly.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:34.420]   Hey, let's talk about security updates.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:39.140]   Make sure you get your security update for your Macintosh.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:44.700]   There was a big hack which we've talked about at great length on security now of a Dutch
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:50.020]   certificate authority, Digi Notar, which allowed the Iranian government among others to spy
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:55.620]   on Gmail users by doing a man in the middle attack pretending posing as Google because
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.780]   they were able to get a fake Google certificate.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.380]   Many, many certificates were issued for Twitter, Google, Yahoo, everybody pretty much.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.100]   Microsoft and Apple.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.740]   Apple was the last company, however, to update.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.860]   They just updated their certificates two days ago.
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.900]   Everybody else had done it about 10 days ago.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.340]   So they have released an update and if you haven't got that update, it's small, it's
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.380]   a few hundred K. You're going to want to do that just to make sure that you are not vulnerable
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:25.860]   to this interesting point.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.860]   The update is not available for PowerPC Max.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.220]   This is what we were talking about earlier.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.340]   Apple is absolutely willing to cut loose anybody who's not up to date.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:40.620]   The company apparently is not only not going to release this update for PowerPC Max, but
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:46.580]   they're done releasing updates for PowerPC Max period.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:51.260]   You have to have Snow Leopard to get the latest updates and Scorsnol Leopard does not run on
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.020]   PowerPC.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.540]   There is one alternative if you don't want to update for whatever reason.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:03.780]   You don't have access, but if you're using the Chrome browser, the Google updated Chrome
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.300]   to that it would reject any of those suspect certificates.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:13.380]   One of the reasons why Apple was so late in doing it is because they worked.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:18.780]   The OS treats itself as the ultimate authority and what certificates can be trusted and rejected.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:25.220]   You couldn't just simply update one little thing and let that new, that one little application
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.540]   be bulletproof against this attack.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.540]   Chrome will take care of it.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.340]   There's another leg up on Chrome as a secure browser.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.340]   Yeah, I used Chrome.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:37.580]   Firefox also updated, in fact, even in an Explorer was updated long before Apple.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.660]   And you can't manually go through your keychain and remove the certificate.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660]   Apparently not.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.900]   There was some sort of, I saw a workaround, but it was really tricky.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.220]   You had to change, you could do it, but you had to change some things.
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:54.420]   There is a good article on CNET talking about what you can do if you have an older system
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:10:00.300]   run Safari in private browsing mode, disable content management add-ons unless absolutely
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.660]   needed, install, click to flash, no script, flash block, and other security plug-ins for
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.940]   Safari.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:13.500]   And then it does list some manual fixes, including, I think, the certificate fix, which
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:18.820]   is, yeah, it has that fairly complicated certificate fix in keychain.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:24.300]   That's it, the Mac Fix It column by Toford Kessler on a CNET's reviews site.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:30.260]   So, recommend it to check that out if you are running a previous version of Leopard or
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.180]   prior to Snow Leopard, I should say.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:36.420]   But you're right, the big story is PowerPC users are now second class citizens.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.420]   Yep.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:42.540]   And you know, now, now, they've been for a while.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.540]   You can't get Lion.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:48.380]   Lion doesn't even have Rosetta, so if you have older software like Quickins, into its
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:55.260]   quicken, you're out of luck, I mean, Apple running a second generation of Airport Express,
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:00.420]   802.11, base station.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.540]   Remember they've updated the Wi-Fi routers.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:11.260]   This apparently has to do with iCloud's launch coming up this fall.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:16.500]   The update rounds out, tune-ups across Apple's Airport device family, including the time capsule
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.500]   in the Airport Extreme base station.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.540]   So the Express is the little one that plugs into the wall.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.540]   I'm glad they still make that.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.180]   I really like the Airport Express.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:32.700]   So I'm not sure what's new in here, but maybe we'll find out soon when it comes out.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.820]   Apple Insider has that story.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.980]   Quickly, just running through a bunch of stories before we get to our PIX EFI firmware update
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.620]   for MacBook Airs.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.420]   It gives you a Thunderbolt display support.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.420]   That's good.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:51.340]   Android's app volume passes the app store in terms of number of downloads, but iOS developers
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.580]   still make more money.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.580]   Not surprising, is it?
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.980]   Not surprising at all.
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.940]   I think we're going to...
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:05.420]   Apparently Apple's planning another campus after they finished the spaceship in 2015.
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.420]   That other campus?
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.420]   On Mars.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.700]   No, no, that's a joke.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.660]   Now it is time.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:16.140]   So normally we get an iOS tip from Alex Lindsey.
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.340]   We will get a line tip from Andy and Aco.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.700]   Maybe you could think of an iOS tip for us.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.980]   You have time, Aaron or Don, either one of you.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.940]   We also have some emails, too, at our new email address, MacBreak@twit.tv.
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:32.660]   Before we do that, I do want to talk a little bit about audible.com.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.180]   We all are big audible fans.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.140]   We love listening to those audiobooks on audible.com.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.740]   I always listen to Andy's recommendations.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.220]   He's got great ones.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.500]   He's finishing David McCullough's fantastic, The Greater Journey About Americans in Paris
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:48.940]   in the 19th century.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.940]   Nobody makes history more accessible than David McCullough.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:51.940]   I just love it.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:55.100]   He's just amazing.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.340]   Let me tell you the story on audible.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.980]   Andy, if we can, we'll get another pick from you.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.260]   Actually, I think this is a great pick.
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.140]   I'm very excited about this one.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.460]   But let me just point out what audible is.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.820]   If you go to audible.com, you can find out about it.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:09.860]   It is a 75,000 book strong audio bookstore.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.980]   Much anything you'd ever want.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.740]   You can listen to.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:18.340]   One of the reasons I really love that is because I can't read like I used to.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   I fall asleep in bed reading.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:25.820]   But I do have a lot of time at the gym, in the car, doing housework where I could read
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.140]   if I could only hold a book.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:32.220]   Audible solves that problem because I have a great audible app on my iPhone and my Android
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.220]   phone.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.980]   Of course, Audible on the iPod is fantastic or the iPad.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.380]   I actually put audible books on my iPad all the time.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:44.100]   There are so many wonderful volumes to choose from.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.100]   You never run out.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:49.220]   Plus, your audible library is always accessible to you with that audible app, which is kind
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.220]   of cool.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.100]   It works on Android as well because you can go back through your library.
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.460]   If there's nothing that suits you, just go back and listen to something you've downloaded
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   in the past.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.580]   I've been downloading books since 2000.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.380]   I have 500 books on my library.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.540]   It's a little bookshelf on my iPhone and all of them are available.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.540]   You see, Andy?
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.540]   I'm the secretary.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.540]   It's coming up.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.540]   The big short end game.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.540]   I just finished that.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.780]   That's the Bobby Fisher book.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.780]   These are all books you recommended.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.940]   I'm listening to Solaris at the gym.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.540]   I have different books for different locales.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.340]   So Andy and I go give us a recommendation.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:26.980]   This is a book you can get free folks by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.060]   Andy?
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.780]   This one is a really good one.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:34.580]   I just got released on Audible and on Kindle and in print today, Roger Ebert's memoir,
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.260]   "Life, It's Cell."
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.660]   I read it about two weeks ago.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.660]   It was probably the best thing about the blackout was that I had an advanced copy of
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:42.900]   this hardcover.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.900]   So without burning the battery on my iPad, I had this hardcover just had my light out
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.820]   and just reading this immensely satisfying story.
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:51.820]   It's a memoir.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:58.860]   But to call it an autobiography kind of cheapens it, it's almost as if Roger Ebert is writing
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:03.780]   a fiction story about this character, fascinating character who's had incredible life, who's
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.860]   spent a lot of time not only having great adventures but thinking about what those adventures
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.940]   and what those experiences have meant to him over the course of his life.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.260]   So if you're thinking that you're going to get a lot of opinions about movies, you will
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.820]   get a lot of opinions about movies.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:21.260]   If you're going to think you're going to be hearing a lot of positive and negative things
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.900]   about Gene Siskel, you will get those as well.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:30.340]   But really, it is, if you had no idea who Roger Ebert was, you would be immersed in this
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.060]   page after page from start to finish.
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:38.220]   I mean, I've heard so many of these stories from Roger before and every time I read them
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:44.660]   in the book, it was just a brand new, very, very fresh and very, very engrossing read.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.580]   It's some of the stuff has been, there are a few pieces that if you're readers of his
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:52.740]   blog, you might recognize, but they've been adapted and totally rewritten.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.780]   So it's not as though he's just cut, cupping, pasting things.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.660]   This is a totally original, totally new work.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:03.740]   And the audio version is, I teased this a couple of weeks ago, because I heard that the
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:08.340]   presenter for this book is Edward Herman, who read the greater journey.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.340]   Exactly.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:16.420]   And he really is one of the, if you can choose a presenter for an audiobook, he's one of
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.900]   two names, maybe three names that would come up as the best ones you can get.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.340]   I just downloaded it myself this morning and I've listened to the first like three chapters.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:30.580]   And even after having already read this book cover to cover, just hearing like Edward Herman,
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:36.060]   who knows exactly how to read an audiobook without making it sound stilted or overcoming
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.700]   the writing that you're listening to.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.740]   Oh goodness, what a wonderful, wonderful presentation.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.100]   It's unabridged, you'll get about 13, 14 hours with the stuff.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:49.580]   But as I said, this is just a fascinating and engrossing story.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:55.260]   After each chapter, it's one of those wonderful books where you might even have to just stop
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.180]   and just think and digest for 15 or 20 minutes about the story you've just heard and what
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.180]   it makes you think about your feelings about life and the experiences that you've had.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:10.780]   Honestly, if I could take, if I could keep just five audiobooks that I've ever downloaded,
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.820]   this would have to be one of them.
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:12.820]   It's just that good.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.060]   Well, here's the way to get it free.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.860]   Just go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:18.900]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.620]   You can see I've added it to my next read.
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.620]   So I've got two books.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.220]   I have to tell you, Neil Stevenson's new book is coming out too.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:32.380]   And so I'm reamedy and so I'm really torn.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.700]   But I think I'm going to get, oh, I'm just holding off on.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.700]   I have two credits.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.860]   I'm just, I'm holding off.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.100]   But I think I'll get this one.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.100]   Life itself a memoir.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.140]   As you can see, there's so many great books.
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:47.300]   These are the books that I haven't listened to yet that Annie's recommended and others
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.300]   that I can't wait to get.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.540]   I already on my list.
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.940]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.620]   But get the first one and then worry about the rest.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.380]   You're going to love it.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.140]   Thank you Audible for your support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.820]   Our lion tip of the week, Andy?
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:08.940]   This is a cool hidden utility that was first at least published, bought to people's attention
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:09.940]   by Sub-RosaSoft.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.980]   They make a whole bunch of data recovery tools.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.020]   They did a lot of poking around in the system library and they discovered that there is
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:22.220]   a super top secret Wi-Fi diagnostic utility in Lion.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:31.700]   If you have to look for it, if you go to the Go menu and select My Computer, you can
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:38.180]   then traverse through the System folder, the Library folder, then Course Services.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.140]   Oops, I got it.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:46.980]   First of all, it's hard to get to My Computer because, okay, so System folder.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   The folder is the folder.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:53.780]   And then you scroll down to the bottom, you'll find a standard application called Wi-Fi
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.780]   Diagnostics.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:55.780]   What the heck?
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:56.780]   Where'd that come from?
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.780]   There you go.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.780]   Wow.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.420]   And it's a tech utility.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:07.780]   It's not a consumer utility that will basically tell you, basically, what's going on in your
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:08.940]   Wi-Fi signal.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:12.740]   The easiest thing to understand is it'll give you like a live graph of the signal noise
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:13.740]   ratio.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:18.540]   If you're getting plenty of bars but it's just flaking out on you, you can see that, gee,
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.060]   there's a signal bar, there's a noise bar.
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:25.580]   So long as the signal is about 20 points higher than noise, you're okay.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:28.620]   If those two lines are kind of tracking close to each other, you know that you've got a
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.740]   lot of interference coming from someplace else.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:36.180]   So that's the one most consumer-friendly feature you can get from this utility.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:39.220]   The rest of it is mostly data capture and data logging.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:43.740]   So if you want to know exactly what is, you've got an open Wi-Fi channel and you want to
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:47.860]   know exactly what the operating system is seeing and the sort of events that are occurring
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.020]   over the Wi-Fi network, excuse me, over this Wi-Fi connection, it will log every single
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:56.060]   event and every single thing that, not all the traffic, but every single event related
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:59.100]   to the operating system and opening and closing and maintaining this.
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:03.860]   If you know what you're doing, you can also have it log all the Wi-Fi traffic and we'll
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.940]   just simply, basically, you're pressing the record button.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:12.340]   You'll record everything that it sees to a file which a separate utility that you'll
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:16.500]   have to find elsewhere can then sort of tear apart and show you exactly what was going
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500]   on in that channel.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.700]   So it's a good thing if you suspect that, yeah, I think that we might, I've got an office
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:25.700]   with like four or eight different Wi-Fi base stations.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:30.540]   I think that there's a collision between two of these routers that is not making itself
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540]   apparent.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:35.620]   I want to look at to see exactly what this Mac thinks is going on in the network.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:39.260]   It will help you out with that sort of, that sort of a thing if you know how to view this
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.900]   file and how to analyze it.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:45.820]   But it will also, if you know how to use it properly, if you've got an open Wi-Fi network,
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:49.700]   it will let you see all the URLs, a lot of clear text, a lot of the traffic that's actually
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.700]   happening.
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.860]   Again, if you know how to manipulate these files correctly, but it's a good thing to know
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.860]   how to get it.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:59.660]   It'll give you, with a very small amount of information on how this tool works, it'll
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:04.860]   give you a quick thumbs up, thumbs down on where the source of your Wi-Fi problems is,
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.580]   whether it's a problem with your router, whether it's a problem with the hardware or whether
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.780]   you just don't know what you're doing when it comes to networking.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.380]   Oh, I love this.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.780]   Right there, just launch it.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.480]   If you want to avoid the problem, you can always just drag it into the dock and then
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.100]   just launch it with a click after that.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.420]   But you don't have to type any sort of secret password to get there.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.700]   It's just buried someplace where the consumer can't see it.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.700]   We had, actually, it's interesting.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:28.820]   We had an issue because when we were first setting up the studio, we had some flapping
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.020]   happening on the routers.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.500]   We had to go through all sorts of hoops.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.380]   If I had this, I could have told you.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.580]   Oh, thank you, Andy.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:37.580]   Good tip.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:41.820]   Now, Aaron, or I guess, Don, but since Aaron's sitting right here, I'll ask him first.
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.540]   I have a pick and a hint all in one.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.060]   All right, let's have a pick and a hint.
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:48.580]   So you're talking about the Airport Express and one of the things that was really neat
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:53.620]   about it was that's where we found out about airplay, the ability to stream music and video
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.620]   over the Wi-Fi connection.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:02.060]   There's a set of speakers now that has this airplay support built in, which is the Zeppelin
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:06.860]   speakers, and I believe they're banging olives and Zeppelin.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.180]   They sound great.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.020]   So you can airplay to a Zeppelin speaker?
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   That's right.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   They sound great.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.100]   They look great and they have a great--
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.100]   It's B&W, actually.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:20.060]   Bowers in Wilkinson are often confused B&O with B&W.
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.980]   This is one of the best speaker manufacturers in the UK.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.300]   It has a cradle where you can put your iPhone, so if you want to play it directly, you can.
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:31.780]   And then if you wanted to use airplay, it took me a little bit of time to figure out how
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780]   to do this.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.420]   So this is my hint.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:39.300]   To get your music to stream over airplay, you double click the home button.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.660]   And then you have a list of the running apps at the bottom of the screen.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:48.500]   If you scroll to the left, you have a volume knob, and then there will be a little blue
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.700]   button.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:54.140]   And you click on that and you can choose where you want your audio to go to.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.100]   So volume knob.
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.100]   Volume knob.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100]   And you'll see it there.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.820]   And it will say the Zeppelin speakers.
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.460]   I love that.
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.540]   It's really convenient.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:05.540]   It sounds great.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:06.540]   It looks great.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.380]   Because I have Sonos.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:12.900]   And the Sonos, you can get airplay to work, but it involves using an airport express and
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.380]   complicated plugging.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.900]   This would be so much easier just to stream right to the speaker.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.060]   That's great.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.500]   And these are such cool looking speakers, I have to say.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   They sound good.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   They sound awesome.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.500]   B&W makes great speakers.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:30.980]   Some day, I will have a pair of the high-end B&Ws from my home audio system.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.820]   But until then, maybe a Zeppelin.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.140]   One quick thing, though, that airplay button will only show up if iOS can see something
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.780]   on the network that it can stream to.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.780]   So if you don't have--
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.780]   Right.
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:42.780]   --to be the same work.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:43.780]   Basically, yeah, basically.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:47.380]   So if there's nothing on your network that it can see, it will just simply hide the button
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.060]   to keep you from confusing yourself.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.060]   Right.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:53.580]   But if you've got-- but I've been-- when I pull into my driveway, it's awesome because
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.740]   I'm listening to my phone.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.740]   It's in the car dock.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.620]   Suddenly, this thing comes up and is pointing to, oh, do you want to use the Bluetooth speakers
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:06.140]   that are inside your car, the Bluetooth speakers in your office, the AirPort, the AirPlay
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.580]   points that are here, a big list will come up.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.860]   So you could dock your device.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:15.260]   But if you don't want to dock your device, you can airplay from it like the tablet.
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:16.260]   Exactly.
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.260]   From anywhere in your--
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:18.260]   --really neat, though.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.260]   --you're like, no, work.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.260]   OK.
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.260]   I guess I might have to get some Zeplins then.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.820]   Wow, that is really cool.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:24.860]   So I think he's going to do this.
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.460]   Let's see if he finds the little blue button.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.460]   Oh, they didn't find the little blue button.
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.140]   Oh, well.
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:33.820]   Thank you, Aaron.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.340]   How about Don McAllister, your pick of the week, Don?
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:38.340]   Pick of the week.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.340]   Well, I've got a little hint.
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.340]   I've got a pick of it.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:41.340]   Or a hint.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:42.340]   A pick and a hint from you, too.
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   And embarrass a bit of riches.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.340]   OK.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.340]   A very, very quick hint on iOS devices.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:49.420]   I don't know about you, but I end up with hundreds and hundreds of apps.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.860]   And I can never find where I put them on the screen.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.820]   And especially, it gets worse when you put them into folders, because you're flicking
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:58.380]   pack past and you just can't identify the folder that your application is in.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.740]   Plug it into your Mac.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:03.180]   When you go into iTunes, just go to the list of applications that's on the right hand side,
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:06.780]   double tap or double click on the application in the list of apps.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.900]   And it will actually zoom to the screen that it's actually installed on, and you can find
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:10.900]   it from there.
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.980]   So that's just a quick tip on the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:14.980]   Thank you.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:15.980]   Do you want my pick of the week?
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:16.980]   Yes.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:17.980]   OK.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:18.980]   Pick of the week.
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:23.420]   I don't know if I've covered this before, but I had quite some quite complex instructions
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.500]   to put together for some people today.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.700]   And I always, whenever I do that, I always turn to an application called Screensteps,
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.940]   which is a fantastic application that allows you to create written documentation very easily.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:40.540]   It's got a built-in screen capture utility that allows you to both capture the screen
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.540]   or areas of the screen and annotate it.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:45.820]   Now, it's a bit like Skitch, but it's optimized for using with Screensteps, so it's built
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:46.820]   into the application.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:51.740]   And basically, all you do is you write out the different steps of the process that you
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:52.740]   want people to follow.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.980]   You do a screen capture annotated, drop it in.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.020]   And then once you've got your completed document, you can even create manuals and things using
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.300]   this application.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.860]   You can export it to HTML.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:03.620]   You can export it to a PDF.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:07.740]   If you pay for their online service, you can export it to the online service so people
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:08.740]   can get it from the web.
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:13.740]   But it's a really, really easy way to produce some quite complex documentation very, very
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:14.740]   quickly.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:20.220]   And it's a bio-community called Blue Mango Learning, it's over at bluemangolearning.com,
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.220]   and it's Screensteps.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:22.380]   They do several versions.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:24.980]   They do a desktop version, which is around $40.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.860]   They do a pro version, which gives you some additional features.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.500]   And then they do a workgroup and sort of enterprise ones as well.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.100]   But it's a really, really nice application.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.100]   Very cool.
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.100]   Screensteps.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.380]   You've always been really good on helping me get screenshots.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.900]   I remember going back to the Mac Mania crews.
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:43.900]   Oh, that's right.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:48.380]   Which we are going to Australia next year.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.380]   We are indeed.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.580]   Now I know you're probably doing the European River Cruise.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.180]   No, I'm not doing that one.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.620]   Then the next one is Australia.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.620]   I'm skipping it too.
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.820]   So Mac Mania 14 is River Cruise if you go to insightcruises.com.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:08.060]   But Mac Mania 15 will be November, I think it's November 2012.
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:09.980]   November 2012, yeah.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.420]   And we're going to Australia for two weeks.
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.100]   And we would love you to join us.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:18.340]   So go to insightcruises.com if you'd like to know more about that.
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:22.540]   And Don and I and Alison Sheridan from a nozilla cast will be on that.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.540]   It should be a lot of fun.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.540]   Yeah, well, well, you can't see that.
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.540]   Wally's going to be on it too.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.700]   It could be a lot of fun.
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.980]   It includes an eclipse as well.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.980]   Yes.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.740]   A total solar eclipse.
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:37.540]   They don't normally have the eclipse on the screws.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.540]   But it has actually broken.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.700]   Well, I think the Scientific American cruises, they've done this before.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.940]   They've had eclipse cruises.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.860]   So I think they're joining them together, which is great.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.660]   Andy, you should come too.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.660]   We'd love you to come.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.620]   If you come fast, if invited, I would serve.
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:54.620]   All right.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:55.620]   So I'll always want to.
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:56.620]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.620]   I'll talk to the cap.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.860]   No, no, I have some clap.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.220]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:05.420]   cloud, I, it is not, I've been so honoured and so pleased to be invited on many cruises
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   in the past.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.340]   I anticipate that I will be invited more in the future.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.300]   As always, how many births do they have available?
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.340]   What kind of instructors can teach?
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.580]   What sort of classes?
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:19.460]   It is not a, it's a, I'm, I'm, I never expect to be invited on any of these cruises, but
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:22.340]   I've got to tell you that I'm always very pleased by him because it's always a lot of
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340]   fun.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.660]   Andy, let's get your pick of the week and then we'll wrap this thing up.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:29.460]   My pick of the week, I'm a little bit late to the party on the idea of converting your
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.460]   iPod nano.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:31.460]   You got one, huh?
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.100]   I finally got one beat.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:38.620]   Well chiefly because it often takes time for like the technology to really, for a cool
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.460]   idea to turn into an actual useful product.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:47.100]   And so you've probably seen this sort of thing before where you take an iPod nano and then
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:53.380]   you just click it into this little band here and it turns it into a wristwatch.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:57.260]   And the reason why I really didn't like them to begin with was because the first ones that
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:02.260]   they did that the company that people came up with were really pretty horrible where it
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:09.020]   would spend like $100 for this really big chunky, silly, stupid looking thing that was just
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.260]   an unwearable object.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:15.300]   But this, but in the past year or so they've actually managed to figure out how to do it
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.300]   correctly.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:25.380]   I think mine is a watch from I watch, I'm sorry, people, I watch is I W A T C H Z dot
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.540]   com.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:30.580]   But the, the, I think they've done it exactly right in that it clicks in just really, really
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:35.060]   simply, it's very, very secure because it doesn't feel as though it's going to fall
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.700]   off my wrist when I'm walking around with it.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.500]   You can easily, it's thin enough.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.700]   You can still put like the sleeve of your jacket around it.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:48.060]   And best of all, you can get these things for like $20, $22 in a whole range of different
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.060]   colors.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.540]   So that's exactly the three points that I needed to happen for this sort of thing before
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.540]   I would buy one myself.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:56.620]   I'm wearing this for the past two or three days just to see how it feels.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:59.180]   And actually this, this has sort of become my sport watch.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:03.860]   I have my old, my regular analog watch that I like just for the ability to simply look
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:08.260]   at my wrist and tell the time without having to press a button and activate a screen.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:12.020]   But when I'm in a situation where I know that like I'm cooking, I'm baking things I need
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:15.260]   like to have a, I need to be able to walk around the house and have like a stopwatch
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:16.980]   going at a time, something down.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:18.620]   This is the watch that I'm wearing.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.620]   So cool stuff.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:23.460]   Let's see if it's still, because I don't know if it's still going to be operative in a
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:26.740]   month when Apple hopefully will have their iPod event.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:32.500]   But you'll still, if you still have this generation iPod, iPod nano, it'll still be
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500]   a really cool watch.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.980]   I'm going to predict that they stick with the existing nano styling.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.020]   I can see any reason to change that.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.020]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.260]   I got to say that I understand this design a lot more now that I've been wearing it
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.660]   around my wrist as opposed to clip to my jacket.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:51.420]   As a matter of fact, I haven't been even really using the nano because I'm just terrified
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:56.260]   that it'll just fall off at some point and I will not notice I've lost this $140 thing
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.260]   somewhere.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.260]   It's true.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.940]   But for this, it actually works really well.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.980]   I use it at the gym and I really, it's so small and light.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:03.980]   I just really like it.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:04.980]   It's a really great fit.
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:08.780]   It's caused me to sort of redefine this as the fitness oriented iPod.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.780]   It is.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.700]   Thank you, Andy and Naka.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.540]   Andy is at the Chicago Sun Times where you'll find his great writing and reviews of all
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:19.660]   kinds of things, even sometimes Windows things.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.860]   And of course his website www.cwob.com.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:23.860]   Lots of pictures there too.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:24.860]   He's a great photographer.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:25.860]   Thanks.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.660]   And it's so nice to have you once again, Andy.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:33.140]   It's really great to have Aaron Hilligas take time off from his Northern California vacation
[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:35.020]   with his wife and kids.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.980]   And we want to thank Walden and Notto for coming on the show.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:40.820]   They were great.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:44.380]   And I didn't make your wife come on the show because it was a story about her running over
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.380]   the computer.
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:47.380]   Mac Bulgaria.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.380]   But we do thank you for being.
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.380]   It's always great to have Aaron here.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.820]   BigNerdRanch.com if you want to know more about it.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:32:01.340]   We do training, contract programming and books on iPhone, Android and desktop cocoa.
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:05.380]   Desktop cocoa is not as tasty as it sounds by the way.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.020]   You got my hopes up.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.020]   I'm sure they're on Amazon.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:12.740]   In fact, I'm just going to check here in Hilligas.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:13.740]   In books.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:18.020]   I share the last name with Clifford Hilligas, the creator of Cliff Notes.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.020]   Really?
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.020]   On Amazon?
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.020]   Any relation?
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.020]   Yeah, just in relation.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:23.020]   I've learned that many Hilligas.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.620]   Well, he doesn't show up high on the Amazon results.
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.820]   You get the iOS program.
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:29.180]   That's a great book which you just gave me.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.180]   Thank you.
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.100]   And then I have the original cocoa programming.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:35.740]   We'll be coming out with a fourth edition of cocoa programming from macOS 10 soon.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.740]   Oh, good.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:40.220]   And then very soon will be my introductory book, The Objective C, The Big Nerd Ranch
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.220]   Guide.
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.820]   You know what I've been doing lately is buying these books on Kindle.
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.700]   I don't know why, but it's just kind of nice to have one Kindle.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.700]   No, it's great.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.060]   And we've been working really hard to make the Kindle and the iBooks experience very
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.060]   good.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:53.540]   And so it's both Kindle and iBooks.
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:57.100]   I know why I buy a Kindle because I'm very impatient and I want it now.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.100]   Right.
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.340]   Well, it's nice that the Kindle is available on all different platforms.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.340]   Right, exactly.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.620]   That's the other reason I do it.
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:06.660]   Don McAllister's screen casts online is the place to go to see Don.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:10.660]   It's really training, but I need to call it training because it's so easy.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:16.700]   It's so fun and you do such a great job of it and his lovely British voice just makes
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:17.700]   it.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:18.700]   I should kind of mention one thing, Liam.
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:22.940]   It's something that as long as I've started for the past two weeks, the third week this
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:28.180]   week, and I've started incorporating subtitles in the weekly video now.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.700]   So that if anyone is deaf or hard of hearing and they want to follow along on the screen
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:35.700]   cast, they can actually switch on some English captions.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:39.340]   So they can just follow along and switch my voice off completely if they want to and
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.140]   just read on screen what's actually happening on screen.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.100]   So that's something new that I've brought in.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:48.580]   Now it is, it's on the last two members shows, but this Friday there's going to be the
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:51.580]   standard monthly free show and there'll be subtitles on that show as well.
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:56.820]   So I want to carry on doing for the future really so that will help not just hard of
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:00.940]   hearing and deaf people, but also course non-English speaking or people who might have
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.100]   difficulties following my accent or if I talk too quickly, they can switch on the subtitles
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:06.100]   and follow along.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.940]   Yeah, I think that's wonderful.
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:08.940]   Good job.
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:09.940]   Thank you.
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:10.940]   Well, that's my meal here.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:11.940]   That's you.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.940]   Oh, right.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:13.940]   I mean, that's me.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.940]   I mean, that's me.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.940]   It's you on me.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:16.940]   I'm playing it.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:18.940]   Really having Wallace and Gromit teach you how to use the Mac.
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.100]   It's just lovely.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.100]   What are the benefits of using it?
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.100]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.100]   We really appreciate it.
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:25.620]   Always great to have you done.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.620]   Thank you all for watching.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.100]   We do the show 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern.
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:32.300]   That's 1800 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:36.740]   Actually, we've decided we're, you can go to twit.tv and watch it.
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:40.740]   We've decided to keep live.twit.tv alive because apparently that's the best way to
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.540]   do it on a PS3.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.340]   So we need that website for legacy users.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.740]   See, unlike Apple, we're not going to cut you off.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.980]   We're going to keep you going as long as you want.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:52.740]   So live.twit.tv or just plain old twit.tv.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.420]   If you do go to twit.tv, that's where you'll find the shows after the fact.
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.260]   And you can subscribe to my iTunes and all the other great places.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.580]   Podcasts are found.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.180]   So you can always watch or listen anytime.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.180]   Thank you for being here.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.180]   We'll see you next week.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.180]   Now get back to work.
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.180]   Break time is over.
