[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.760]   cars. And why that mean Elizabeth Warren wants to break up Apple. It's all coming up next on Mac

[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that features Tim Apple and the gang.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   Every week. The gang this week is Mr. Renee Richie from imore.com and the fabulous vector show.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.840]   Hello. Renee Vector reporting for today. Renee Vector is here. Lori Imore is also here. Lori Gill.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   She's managing either imore. Hello, Lori. And I guess that means we call you Andy WGBH.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   No, if Tim is abandoning the title Chairman Honeycrisp, as we spoke on him by
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.400]   I'm now Chairman Honeycrisp. Thank you very much. If you do go to Tim Cook's
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.760]   Twitter feed, he is now calling himself Tim Apple.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.080]   Is that such a subtle troll? Of course, I'm on a Windows machine. So he's really Tim Squarebox.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.880]   But I guess he doesn't really care how it looks. So let's specify it. You had a code
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   fonts Leo. Yeah, an Android or any of the other. Actually, maybe it's maybe it's like a double
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.240]   a double thing he's doing against like the the upcoming like investigations. It's Tim
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.520]   redacted. Oh, it's redacted Apple. Tim redacted.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.360]   Or your Micah Sergeant. But they said like the Android and Windows should fill those characters
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.800]   so that it double trolls him. So he shows up as Tim Robot on Android. I do want to point out
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.360]   that somebody is trolling Tim Apple on Twitter because when I go to Tim's site on my deactivated
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.120]   Twitter cast suggests I follow the president twice over here on the right. So clearly there
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.680]   are now tied at the hip and Hugh Jackman. That's and Hugh Jackman. I don't know why I'm supposed to
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.880]   follow. What does Tim Apple have to do with Hugh Jackman?
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.960]   Maybe it's because they don't like Ryan Reynolds. I don't know.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.400]   Could be could be could be.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.880]   Tim also play a play Wolverine. I think like in the in the or I know he voiced it in the Fox
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.040]   channel. This is snick.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.560]   Right. Now I'm really annoyed because I every time I open Twitter on this machine it because
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.240]   there's a cookie here. It locks me back into my deactivated Twitter account.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   So you'll excuse me if I deactivate it one more time. What is it? T T W W T R the beta Twitter.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.040]   T W T R. That's their old name, believe it or not. Yeah. T W beta.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.240]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would sign up for that.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:19.280]   Just like after after Mark Zuckerberg's blog post. I immediately reactivate my Facebook account.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.520]   I believed him. I thought, well, of course, genius. No, but that was so genius because he took
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.280]   everything that people were complaining about and figured out a way to be even more anti-competitive
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.440]   and make more money by seemingly acquiescing to one one high level word that they used in their
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.680]   complaints. Well, you know, you would have all the people know this because you're an expert in
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.120]   Brazilian jujitsu and it was exactly what you do in jujitsu, right? You tell me it was the
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.920]   opponents enemy and use it against them. It works. It works better if you imagine him saying it in
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:05:00.720]   our sarcastic voice. You mean we can lock people. We are so good to change to make sure we've earned
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.280]   your credit. So I read it in a nice, honest, Tim Cook style voice and I reactivate my Facebook
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.800]   account. And then by the end of Twit last Sunday, I realized, Annie, that's exactly how much it
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.280]   serves. Yeah. And I deleted my account again. It's like when you got caught last time and he said,
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.040]   oh, it was the developers. We're just not going to give developers any data anymore. But we're
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.920]   launching our own dating service. And now this is like, oh, we're going to use encryption. We'll
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   still have all the data, but no one else is going to see it. We'll be private. We know that's what
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.800]   you want. Anyway, that's neither here nor there because we're here to talk about Apple and it is
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.520]   now official. And I'm just wondering show of hands, how many of you got invites to the March 25th event?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:52.000]   Of course, Renee is going. And of course, I'm not going. What did the
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.760]   Renee invite say? It was like a video. It was a three, two, one countdown. And then it's show time.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.400]   And the original one was on a pure black background. But if you go to apple.com now and scroll down
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.040]   and click on the event page, it looks like it's the back of a MacBook or an iPad or something on
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.880]   space, space gray aluminium. Well, that's different than the one than the invitation they sent out
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.120]   to everybody. Yes. Okay. Yes. Here it is. It's show time. Maybe yours is fake then.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   Maybe let me turn off my.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   Maybe the clips team sent it to me as a new filter. And I didn't realize it does look like a little
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.560]   titanium in the background. Or maybe to celebrate the relationship they're having with all these
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.760]   video creators. That's what happened like after apple provided its notes on the first invite.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.480]   Steve Jobs from the great said, you know, that is that's a little too edgy, a little too
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.920]   black and white. Can we have some shades of gray in there, please? Are we happy with the
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.120]   curning? Here's John Petchkowski's invitation for us. Same. No different ones this time one.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.960]   Yeah. So no surprise. It's show time points to the fact that I think everybody well, actually,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.880]   it's interesting because Petchkowski kind of highlighted the headline to the news event as a news event,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   but really it's show time implies we're going to see the new TV offering.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.280]   Yes. Yeah. And he said, no, I pass, but everybody's expecting you. I pass. I think you can't have
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.800]   an apple event without people expecting hardware anymore. So it's going to be interesting to see
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   how they manage those expectations. Yeah. Are they going to give us what we want and give us some
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.480]   hardware? Are they going to say no? Well, they might wait till June till WWDC and do all the hardware
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.520]   at once because we know there are also new laptops probably, right?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   Well, the only real new iPad we're really thinking about is an update to the 329 base model educational
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.160]   iPad. And that one they could probably get. Oh, or the minute. But the, okay, that's true.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.720]   The basic, the basic 329 one they could do with just a press release, but if they do a mini,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.880]   you're right. Okay. How long it's been since they're many, it's been two years. The
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.720]   middle, the last minute was announced this time of year, right early in the year,
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.640]   the last time the mini four. I remember it was September, but the last the the iPad nothing has
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.360]   been announced in April and March the last two years. Yeah, April has a press release. March
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.080]   was the event. Okay. Yep. Remember, it is an educational thing. So that's where they'd stack
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.560]   that up at it. And the iPad mini four is what two years old now? Three three. It was September.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.240]   Yeah, it was a September event. Oh, by the way, we have an iPad mini four. It was like,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.800]   it was like one quarter of a slide at the end of Phil's.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.880]   You know how you know, because it had an eight chip in it. So it's easy to do the math. You just
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.440]   ate 12 minus four. It was eight. So it's four years old, right? Is it worked that way? Not really.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.360]   I'm going to go before Congress and do the math video. Sort of works that way. No, don't they do
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.080]   a new a every year. Yep. This will be a 13. Not everything will get the new a.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   Anyway, I liked the iPad mini. I wouldn't mind seeing your release. And I guess what you could say
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.600]   if you come out with an iPad mini on at this event in two weeks is oh, and here's a great way to
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.680]   read Apple news. The most affordable way to read Apple news and watch Apple video.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.120]   So I don't know who I'm imitating there. I don't think any of them.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.880]   Here's what we were almost certainly know. Apple already has a news product.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.160]   Oh, wait a minute. I got something from Tim. Tim's square box.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.800]   Yeah, look, let's just I'm going to look inside. I'm very excited. This is just,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.120]   this is about to send it to you. And then you heard that Tim just arrived at our post office box.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:42.800]   Three. Oh, two. One. You are not going. Art Tim. Oh,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.000]   at least he loves you. That was so great. Who came up with that? Oh, my staff. They're always,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.560]   they're always thinking. I mean, I could have had a big hand with a button, but no, I got this.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.360]   You don't know how many lawyers. I don't have nearly as many lawyers.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.000]   So we know that there's Apple news. We know they bought texture, which was a one price magazine
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.080]   subscription. They were big advertising bars and we loved them. The idea was you get most,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:19.200]   almost every magazine. There were a few missing, but a lot of the big magazines for one low monthly
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.640]   fee, which was trying to remember was it was around $10. I still have my subscription. I think
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.600]   it's about Canada was more, it was almost a few things that were available in Canada as well.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.360]   So I subscribe. It was created by the magazine publishers themselves, Condi and Meredith, I think.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.240]   Rogers and Canada. So they had a deal. It was easy to get all the magazines.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.400]   Those deals all went by the way. So I went, Apple bought them. Apple, we've already read in the
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.920]   Wall Street Journal, is having, was having trouble convincing people to go for the proposed offer.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.320]   The journal said it was 50/50. We take the subscription, we take half the money,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.560]   and we don't give you information about the subscribers. But hey, at least you're getting
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.800]   something. And we discussed this at length. And I think we don't alter the bargain further.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.000]   We came to the conclusion that while it's a great deal for a national magazine that might
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.360]   be struggling on a newsstand, where do you find a newsstand these days?
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   And can use the national exposure. It's not such a good deal as Andy pointed out for
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.120]   like the Boston Globe or a paper that is local in nature, because that's just going to undercut
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.760]   them completely. I think for a national newspaper like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.400]   or the Washington Post, it might be, although all three of them have very successful digital
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.840]   efforts. Anyway, we'll find out. It's a week from Monday, the 25th.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.680]   The biggest thing I want to see is that I talked about this earlier today on I'm
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.920]   more is that this just subscription fatigue. I was going through all my subscriptions and there's
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.560]   just one after the other. I set up a series shortcut where I can say audit subscriptions
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.960]   now and it goes to that page because I've forgotten half the stuff that I've subscribed to. And they're
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.040]   all like 10 bucks a shot. And you don't think about it when you do the micro transaction, but it
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.560]   really adds up and you start having Netflix here and Hulu there and then Apple Music and now Apple
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.880]   News and Disney Plus and all of these things. And suddenly it's like 100 bucks or 200 bucks.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.000]   And nobody's even trying to solve for that yet.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.640]   I'm also keen to see how they've tried to adapt a Netflix model, which is full of,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.120]   hey, I had no idea this movie was available or hey, I had no idea that this Korean soap
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.360]   opera even existed until it was recommended to me or till I wrote right about in the AV club,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.400]   how that adapts to something that you're supposed to have like a regular weekly or monthly
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   relationship with like a magazine. It's it's even Marvel Comics Unlimited is really the only
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.240]   closest analog I can think of. And even there, it's more of though it's more like they're presenting
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.320]   you with 10,000 20,000 back issues rather than here is the latest issue of whatever on an all
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.120]   unique basis. And DC is doing that weird thing where it's all DC like it's not all of Warner
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   Brothers is no Harry Potter. And it's not just DC Comics, but it's DC Comics and movies and TV
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.400]   shows. And that's like they're just all carving out these really weird spaces and they all want
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.520]   10 bucks. Disney Disney is opening their own channel. So we're in if you want any Disney content,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   which means if you want any Marvel content, that's not going to be on Hulu. It's going to probably
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.320]   be on this channel really something something's not the comics. I got to pay for the comics
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.040]   separately from the movies, which is a death. But I do get the but I do get the Star Wars stuff.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.640]   There's just like as a consumer, it's so confusing. But isn't this kind of the the this is what we
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.920]   asked for when we said we don't want to pay the high prices of cable of owning cable. We want to
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.960]   be able to pick and choose what we want. So we're getting it now. So why are we complaining about
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.040]   how many subscriptions we have when this is literally what we want was to be able to pick and choose
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.520]   what we did want on a car, didn't we? But we were saying, I wanted to bundle it, right?
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.600]   Give people what they want. Now we're telling these same companies that we said,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.640]   stop trying to sell us these huge bundles that we don't watch. Now we're telling them, we want
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.000]   you to bundle it all into one. So it's a lot easier for us to subscribe to it.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.960]   Or just give it to us free. I mean, that's what people are saying is when they, I'm not going to
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.080]   pay for Apple subscriptions, but if they give it to me free with the device, I'll take it.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.160]   So that's the question. What are we going to get? And how we how is Apple going to package this?
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.520]   We've talked before about Apple Prime, where they give you one fee for everything iCloud,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:21.840]   movies, magazines, Apple music, all together, you know, and that would be an interesting I pay
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.000]   a hundred bucks a year for that. And I noticed that's not $10 a month.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.520]   That's less than you pay for Apple music now. And it's like eight or times.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.680]   So how much would it be? 200 bucks a year?
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.360]   No, I think people are thinking like if it was Apple Prime, it'd be like 50 bucks a month.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.800]   It'd be like a ton of different stuff. It was an iPhone.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.120]   I think that's a non-star as well. I think that's a non-star.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.880]   I guess it depends what it really includes.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.800]   If it's Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple News, an iPhone upgrade program where you get a free
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.080]   phone, essentially, not a freebie. You get a replacement phone every year, Apple Care Plus on
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.240]   that phone, iCloud storage. I mean, they'll have to build one of those graphs where Steve's like,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.960]   yes, you know, people buy a phone now and they buy an iPod because we sell it to them. And they
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.320]   pay 450 bucks for this. And we're not going to charge you up any more.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:15.120]   Yeah, it's really hard to guess, isn't it? Because I can't I was as as it happens.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.840]   I spent part of this morning editing a collaborative document in pages.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.200]   And after I had finished what I needed to do and went back to my meditation,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:34.400]   it was a slick enough and eventful and eventless enough procedure that once again, I'm thinking
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.720]   that when Apple does decide to pivot fully towards services and bank their future on their ability
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.240]   to make everything that they do work as well as collaborative editing on pages, that's going to
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.520]   be hysterically funny to watch. That's going to be an amusing three or four years because I was
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.200]   handed a link. And okay, great. So I click on this, I click on this link and it tries to open it in
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.080]   the web browser as opposed to in pages in the desktop app. And then it wouldn't actually open
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.760]   it until I signed into iCloud. And I signed into iCloud. And now I have to verify that I am the
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.560]   person who is trying to open this document. And in the meantime, it had signed me out of iCloud.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.680]   And it was like, Oh, okay. So their ability to give me iCloud services, plus Apple music,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.200]   plus streaming video, plus, plus, plus, plus, they're going to have to elevate their game if
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.560]   they're going to have to demonstrate that this is going to be worth 10 or 15 bucks a month.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:39.440]   It's interesting that the invitation really focused on the show, not the news. So does that imply
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.240]   maybe it's all going to be bundled or is just it's going to be first we're going to show you
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:51.760]   is is news time a worse catchphrase. Or or is or is the news products or is the news products
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.160]   still up in the air enough? They don't have the they were it's I easily imagined that just as
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.480]   they weren't going to schedule this video announcement until they knew that they would get they would
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.040]   get Brian Singer up on the stage. They would get Oprah on the stage. They would get surviving
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.600]   Beatles on the stage. They're not going to do the news product until they've got the deals with
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.160]   three or four specific people thereafter, absolutely locked down. So maybe it's that there's these
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.800]   either it's just not ready yet or they're still actually just writing all these contracts to make
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.880]   sure that they can say and look who and we've got Oprah magazine and look we've got I'm actually
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.720]   starting to blank thinking about actual new stuff. You know who I was in there still in publication.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.120]   No I'd put on the stage if I were them a week from Monday. Brie Larson.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.080]   Is that who is that? She's just signed a deal to star in and produce a drama at Apple.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.280]   She's the star of the new Captain Marvel movie and probably the hottest actor in Hollywood
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.840]   this week anyway. Until endgame comes out next. Yeah right. Well you know how it is.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.440]   You got to take it when you get it. But this is yet yet another big name really big name Apple
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.120]   has signed. I mean it's kind of amazing. It's weird that their budget is like is a weird strategy
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.120]   because they're spending way less on on content than Amazon or Netflix are but what they are
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.280]   spending on is really big names. They're not going to have anywhere near the quantity
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   of programming and are amazed to be seeing the quality that they get but the names that they've
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.600]   gotten are spectacular. Well and the names don't the names drive people to subscribe.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.440]   I mean look you have to have a tent pole like Game of Thrones. But they have one and then they
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   have like and then after that episode is finished you can go watch endless catalog content if like
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.880]   the Jennifer Aniston show is finished. What do you watch? Well that's going to be I mean that'll be
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.920]   interesting. I mean what they may do is what HBO does although HBO by the way and now that
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.800]   they're owned by Time Warner I mean not Time Warner now the Time Warner is owned but I can't keep track
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.080]   of it. Who owns Time Warner now? I think anyway the Coke and Pepsi own everything. I think that
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.920]   they're being pushed to move more like to a Netflix model where you just crank out stuff as
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.720]   fast as you can. But what HBO always did which was brilliant was they would have these big
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.920]   debuts and then when that show ended they'd have another one and so they had a tent pole that was
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.680]   almost yearly that all the year round they'd have tent poles as they were able to create more
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.920]   content. Maybe Apple is going to do that. I like the idea that they will have their sort of tent
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.160]   pole shows like you're talking about where every season there's something big that's going to come
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.720]   out next. We'll keep you subscribing. Exactly. But that we also can have some maybe smaller version
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.640]   not everything of iTunes movies and TVs so we can go watch a movie that you might normally have to
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.880]   buy or rent or we could go watch a TV show that you might normally have to get the whole season
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.840]   that's the rumor individually. So if they're all kind of packaged together then you watch all of
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.000]   your iTunes movie and TV content and then when the special TV shows comes out just like you're
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.720]   saying you have a reason to keep subscribing every season because there's something new coming out
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.800]   and maybe they overlap a little so that you can oh and now there's a new show that we're watching
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.840]   so we got to keep our subscription. So far according to Variety it's reported that Apple's forthcoming
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.520]   product and again we should stress this is all speculation Apple isn't saying when low in a
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.440]   week a couple weeks we'll offer access to both original content and other
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:21.920]   SVOD services so you might have stars you might have who knows HBO you might have other stuff.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.360]   But the whiplier is they use it every time they use it. Yeah like Amazon.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.600]   Go ahead Laurie. It's like the Amazon model where within the app itself you can subscribe
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:39.120]   through Apple to get these other programs so Hulu, HBO, stars, Shutter TV all of those could
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.200]   go through Apple to get you into your subscription and it's all kind of packaged in one place.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.160]   Yeah so that's a different-
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:53.840]   Which you already get on Apple TV. If this is true it's just it's within an app or a program
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:02.080]   that's Apple TV. Yeah in fact according to Variety they think that the Apple shows will be free
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.880]   that they'll come with an Apple device you know because you'll have TV on it.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.760]   Free Apple shows could- this is this is the thinking free Apple shows could reach hundreds of millions
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.520]   of consumers in the US alone that would explain how they're getting these big names.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.200]   Free accessibility can let Apple reach consumers other streaming services don't necessarily reach
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.440]   including people with cable subscriptions right now right that aren't you know I mean I bet
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.680]   you there are people right now have spent 200 bucks on cable that don't bother spending money
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.080]   on Netflix because they have more content than they can eat anyway. Free accessibility can let
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:44.400]   Apple upsell customers to these paid SVOD services. So down the line Apple could roll out a paid
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.440]   tier this is again speculation from Variety on its streaming service separate from the core
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.880]   original shows it initially made available for free this wouldn't be completely out of left
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.520]   field from Apple either Apple's looking for franchises it could eventually serve as hooks
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.360]   to lure subscribers to a Netflix like subscription service according to CNBC.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:09.920]   I'm reading it from Variety because Variety is the Hollywood kind of newspaper and it's my best
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.640]   guess that they are well informed about Apple's plans by everybody in Hollywood who's been talking
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:23.840]   to Apple. Yeah they don't have Apple's traditional secrecy right so go ahead it is weird but it's
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.360]   just thinking that Amazon service and Netflix service and Hulu service they all have these
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.040]   wonderful original content that they pay for that have huge audiences and also critical acclaim
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   and occasionally Oscar nominations but they also have the safety net behind them that if they were
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.160]   that they also have this catalog of TV shows and movies that they already have that you're going to
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.560]   get no matter what HBO has the same sort of thing where whether or not this new whatever new series
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   are going to do after Game of Thrones pays off or not they will always have the ability to show
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.640]   you the movies that you missed three months ago and are not worth paying five dollars to rent online.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   If it's going to be interesting to see how Apple packages this if they don't have if they have
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.280]   wonderful original content with people that you names and creators that you recognize but if you're
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.840]   if you're just not interested in Brie Larson's reality pranks show and then okay I'm not going
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.920]   to watch it we watch that for two minutes and you turn it off and you look for something else
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:32.320]   but there isn't 10 episodes 10 seasons of Bob's Burgers waiting for you when you ditch out of that
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.520]   what happens then yeah it's it's I'm not saying I don't what I know what Apple should be doing or
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.800]   what or this is going to fail it's just it's it's fun to have this thing where I honestly don't
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.320]   know Apple clearly has a plan Apple knows how they're going to be successful with this I just
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:55.360]   don't see what the obvious path is for them launching a service that will be important immediately.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.960]   I'm the same way like I know what I want as a consumer I'm willing to
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.720]   I'm really you know Apple before I showed me things that I didn't know I wanted it ended up
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.960]   wanting them but I know what I want as a consumer and you know they have to give it to me or they
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.000]   have to show me why what they're offering is better than what I expected. Yeah.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.640]   Yeah remember when all these rumors were starting with their when during Steve Jobs's last days
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.440]   there were or there are a lot of stories were coming out about how things were winding down and
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   how cryptic things he would be said he would say that people didn't some whoever heard this didn't
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:34.960]   know what the full story was like a cable company said we finally found a way we can crack cable TV
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.880]   or we can crack television and maybe this is still an offshoot of whatever it was that whatever
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:47.520]   the original idea was that Apple five or six or seven years ago. Yeah or whether it was that was
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.720]   cracked for a reason we decided to put it up on the shelf and build a new one of those
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.800]   but it's just a lot of a lot of reasons to wonder exactly what's going to be going on.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:05.280]   Well we hope we will see a lot of teasers clips and celebrities and it's going to be
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.120]   Renee Richie our correspondent on the red carpet a week from Monday 10 a.m.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.320]   Is it who got a free one? What are you wearing? Is that Vero way?
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:24.640]   Apple did maybe tease something in the about the new news feature when they released 10 14 4
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:31.680]   it's out in beta now and there is apparently a hook for something to do with magazine
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.040]   subscriptions. Once again Stephen Troughton Smith Troughton Smith has come up with screenshots
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.600]   here's one little dialogue that says new issues available National Geographic Bon Appetit and Fast
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.680]   Company. Let's talk about the new icon though I mean next to Slack it's the most confusing thing
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.960]   for me to try to find. I like it I like it it's fine I just don't recognize it after I'm
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.280]   hunting my screen trying to find what it is. No I'm trying to put it in your widget and not
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.000]   worry about finding the app. Stick it in your widget. So you don't understand what's like to live in
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.480]   Canada with a news in the widget not always seems to parallel it's like they love to give us widget
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   news which is drunk guy rides moose and maple syrup spill. And the news app when you do that.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:22.720]   That's true. All right. But I do agree with you it's like it's it's just a letter N it's a stylized
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:28.080]   letter N that does nothing to reference or hook into what this app actually does. It's not like
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.880]   the FedEx logo where oh well look there's actually an arrow embedded in the logo or any of these
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.040]   other wonderful app icons where there's a definite relevant cognitive relevance. I mean this could be
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.400]   like the new Netscape logo there are Nest Cafe or anything. Where's Louis Mantile when you need
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:55.360]   them? The notifications have a URL scheme that's https colon slash apple dot news.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:03.600]   And as you can see there's quite a few things on apple dot news. Following for you in history
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.520]   or and save those are all part of the current news app but those magazine related ones are
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.520]   done. Magazines my magazines subscription that's new. Yeah not subscriptions plural.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.920]   Just singular. Right now we're really spending a lot of actually reading into
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:28.640]   Well if it's that's what makes this fun. That's true. If it's if it's subscription singular that
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.880]   could be here's a here's a link to an actual magazine that is available for a subscription
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.480]   as opposed to the ones you've already got.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:45.040]   Or it could be a link to your subscription to apple news. Yeah which will include all of those
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.840]   other things that you love to. I love the idea of being able to access all the different news
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.000]   organizations that I love reading the articles for but I can't afford to have a subscription to
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.280]   each one of them. And therefore I hit my five article Macs you know halfway through the week or
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.800]   something like that. Like I would love to be able to have access to them all the time instead of
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.360]   just a handful of them that you know I it's I love them all I just can't afford them all.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.640]   Yeah I wonder what the economics though is of that. No the the the recurring complaint that every
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.160]   single music publisher has about streaming services is that yes you get ears but you don't get money.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.320]   They much rather they much rather go back to those wonderful days they could charge $18
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.280]   for a CD even if it only has like two songs they actually want but they got to buy the seven
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:41.520]   others of them. Given that a subscription to an online subscription to like a major major online
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:50.400]   publication will cost like five bucks a month or 10 bucks a month. How if if if if if if a news
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.240]   app that comes built into it comes pre preloaded onto onto every single Apple device
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:03.600]   bring some new new eyes how is that going to bring this magazine more money and maybe I can be
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.360]   supporting this make this publication better by actually just going through the web which is the
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.080]   way that I normally aggregate like brand new articles and stuff like that and give them the
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:20.480]   full amount that happen to give even a one penny to Apple. Yeah I mean that that's a great thing to
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.560]   to think about and consider because we want to support these organizations that have brought us
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.200]   so much great information and media in the past but the truth is that that's not the way the
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.000]   world works anymore. Yeah we used to buy newspapers that were delivered to our door every day and we
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.720]   went to the to the store and we bought the magazines that we love or we had a subscription in the paper
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.240]   magazine came to us but that's literally not the way the world works anymore and these organizations
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:52.320]   have to find other ways to do it and it I think that if if the New York Times previously could
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:00.800]   reach a wide audience around around the US and then they they couldn't reach anybody else because
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.160]   nobody else was going to subscribe to this and then here's Apple Apple news coming along and saying
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.560]   there's you know five million more people that could start subscribing to you but it's
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.960]   only a portion of what you were normally getting. Well New York Times was already losing readership
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.200]   anyway because the way the world is turning so no it's not what they could have got 15 or 20 years
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.760]   ago but it's something that they literally couldn't have gotten at all if not for
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.000]   Oregon and not for something a service like this happening. Yeah that's a good point.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.960]   Let's see here I guess that's all we have can say possibly about the 25th it's
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:46.000]   it's just around the corner we will find out we will know more and Renee will be there and then
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.880]   we'll do a live stream as always 10 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time Monday March 25th and Renee
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:01.360]   you think they'll probably announce other hardware in June I would think right. You know it could
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.160]   be some of the stuff could be like they did the in previous years they've done everything from
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.360]   just announced the new update for the iPad and a press release I think they did briefings for
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.200]   the rent they usually have a red iPhone variant in the spring so there could be a bunch of stuff that
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.440]   just comes out comes out that's not at the event or there could be some stuff they want to show
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   off there and then for the for WWC it's gone both ways last year there was no new hardware the year
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.920]   before that there was so much new hardware that Lori Gill and I were literally carrying two iMacs
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.440]   and a MacBook Pro out of the venue up the hotel with a 24 hour embargo to get the reviews done yeah
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.120]   so you know which when I prefer is the less hardware from the reviewers standpoint but from a
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.520]   consumer store point give me all the hardware yeah I think it'd be great if they had an update to
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.640]   Apple TV I don't know what that would be because the current model Apple TV is great but if they
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.000]   were announcing a dot yeah sure if they were announcing something that was all about watching
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.960]   TV and watching movies through some new service a new Apple TV to go along with it sounds like a
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:11.200]   great idea and of course according to rumor nine to five Mac the new iPad will have a touch
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.560]   ID fingerprint reader and headphones it won't be a big redesign so maybe that that is the kind
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   of thing you release in a memo right yeah but well press release whatever if they if they if they
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.200]   were to delete touch ID that means that they're changing to a new bezels new case design also
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   same same exactly so that's this way they can keep the tooling they have the existing product
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.920]   then then just upgrade the processor let's take a break more to come Renee Richie Lori Gill from iMOR
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.520]   and Andy Inaco from Boston Public Radio our show today brought to you by LastPass
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   I tell you what I am without LastPass I don't I don't I'm out of luck but fortunately I have
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   LastPass everywhere that's really the beauty of LastPass whether it's Mac Windows even Linux
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.000]   any browser that you use yeah of course iOS and Android you always have LastPass there to
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.880]   generate long strong random passwords passwords that are yes unmemorable store them safely away
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:19.200]   keep them there let you know when you try to use reuse a password that you've used somewhere else
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.600]   keep you from doing that discourage you from doing that and a lot more LastPass is the best way
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.200]   I hate I wish we didn't have to have passwords but since we do you got to have LastPass and
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.960]   especially if you're a business because your employees you you know if you listen to this show
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:39.200]   you know how to good password management and how to keep track and all that stuff you don't need
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:46.640]   to be told I hope you're not reusing passwords you're not using your nieces birthday and dogs first
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:54.320]   named a blog into sites anymore but your employees are they're doing worse they're putting passwords
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.600]   on Post-it notes on their monitors and more just because it's hard to remember so if you've got a
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:06.320]   business you got to have LastPass Enterprise if your team's close knit you know employees cover
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.400]   each other's vacations in sick days they're probably also sharing passwords hidden indoors
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.880]   under mouse pads visible on monitors in fact we know more than half of all employees share
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.720]   passwords and not just with other employees protect yourself and your business with LastPass
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.400]   the number one most preferred password manager trusted by over 43 thousands businesses I know
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.120]   you know LastPass is available for individuals but I do want to make everyone aware of the fact that
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:39.440]   you can use in your business we do we have for several years and it's great it makes it convenient
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:46.560]   for employees while keeping access to corporate data secure you have complete centralized admin
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.400]   oversight you set master password requirements we for instance make sure we say you have to use
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.760]   two-factor we encourage people to use ubekeys LastPass works with every two-factor device known to
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:03.440]   man including LastPass's own authenticator device which is really sweet because it does instead of
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.960]   six digits it just says approved and I pops up a little push notification on your phone I love that
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.840]   you can have over a hundred policies you'll get actionable security reports you can create shared
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.480]   folders we use that heavily each department has its own shared folder and you can even share
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.280]   passwords with people and not give them the password just say look log into our bank account
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.240]   this way click this link LastPass fills it in but never shows them the password that's really
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.600]   for me the single best reason use LastPass and business your employees don't know your
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.720]   passwords they don't need to we trust LastPass so much we put everything in their database log
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.000]   in's SSH keys software licenses all our business information I use LastPass for my passport
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.600]   every time I travel I know I have a copy of my passport available on all my devices quickly and
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.800]   easily but totally secure that's awesome my driver's licenses in there I even store social
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.240]   security numbers for my whole family in LastPass LastPass is built on a zero knowledge security
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.440]   model data is encrypted and decrypted only at the device level that means LastPass does not have
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:11.040]   access to it only you have access to your passwords and when you use LastPass Enterprise every employee
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.880]   has their own secure vault for managing and accessing passwords so there's really no reason
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.760]   not to use LastPass and there are a million reasons to use it please when you're when you're using
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.120]   passwords in business and I know you are please do me a favor and use LastPass if you use Microsoft
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.800]   Active Directory you can even use that as your main login which makes it even easier there's
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.200]   LastPass for individuals they call it LastPass premium and LastPass for families that's what
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.400]   I use at home makes it really easy to share passwords with my wife she has emergency access
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.640]   if something should happen to me there's LastPass teams for small teams of 50 or fewer and then of
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:52.160]   course LastPass Enterprise which is what we use 13 and a half million people use LastPass
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.800]   it's the first program I put on every new device I just set up a galaxy s10 plus it was so much
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:05.440]   easier thanks to LastPass the best password solution for your team is at LastPass.com/twit
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.800]   LastPass.com/twit
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:15.360]   I'm not going to talk about the galaxy s10 plus because this is the math Apple showed
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.920]   but you can do it it's pretty it's pretty just wishing well you know Samsung makes really nice
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:27.040]   hardware and it's clear when you compare it to the iPhone 10 s screen that they're keeping the best
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.080]   super emilyd screens for themselves I mean it's also six months later and that technology
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.240]   moves okay yeah that's true but always the best OLED screen out there's always on the Samsung
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.760]   like there's two things you can count on when a new phone comes out the display mates gonna say
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.240]   it's the best and DXM work is gonna say the camera that's the camera I'm not sure it's the best
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:52.000]   camera in fact I would say that the iPhone camera is probably better in some ways with
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.040]   fris' color accuracy and the night site on the Google Pixel is better for low light
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.120]   but there is something that this Samsung does I really like it's got three lenses
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   kind of like Apple but one better right so you can anything LG had going for it too now Samsung's
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.840]   got it let me see if I could find a good example here's a good example we were in San Francisco
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.440]   shooting pictures that's the kind of the closest in lens I guess you in an apple parlens called
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:24.320]   that telephoto this is the standard medium range lens and then this is the wide angle and so great
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.800]   it's so wide that it's you actually get barrel distortion but that's kind of a fun effect it's
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.960]   yeah it's actually a neat look and I didn't move this fish eye it's like they went but
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.840]   oh fish eye and they took it one degree back yeah I think it's 18 millimeter is my guess
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.880]   this is the same thing this is the standard I'm standing about six feet from a motorcycle
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.480]   this is I didn't move same shot different lens that's so badly Leo and then the wide edge on the
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.600]   next iPhone but I really I kind of want it now super wide is such an important thing because
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:59.120]   you can't there's a point where you can't move any further back right and so you have to
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.920]   there's so many times where I've had to take a panorama of something because I just said get
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.040]   back right on up sneakers and it's gonna bring it on yeah here's the contemporary Jewish Museum
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.440]   in San Francisco I'm standing right under it there's no way you could get this architectural shot
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.800]   it's so great and if you imagine like the interface we have now where you press that button and you
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.720]   just zoom in to 2x if you could press another button and zoom out I don't know what they'd call
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:27.760]   it minus 2x but look at it look at this distortion I mean you even this person in the shot is actually
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.400]   bent because of the curvature in the lens so I mean there's probably physics like no no offense
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.840]   to Samsung but the the camera software people it will go to an Apple or factorially better yeah and
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.880]   there's probably a lot of AI they could use to to lose and they already do that already to minimize
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:53.440]   the distortion yeah here's a here's a picture I took of a of Megan white angle medium tight you
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:40:00.320]   gotta be careful with a white angle though because you get you get too close and people people yeah
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.280]   she's not gonna hate me for taking it she's gonna hate me for showing it yeah but a little bit of
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.920]   column A a little bit of yeah so screens are great camera I think the camera images are pretty high
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.880]   quality I do think the iPhone and pixel probably beat it in certain regards after I watched his
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:22.640]   review of the galaxy s 10 YouTube suggested mark as his review of the galaxy s5 and just looking
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.480]   back with oh my god we've come a long way moveable back yeah all just amazing how they've gotten
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.760]   their hardware game together demos is telling me that the wide is 13 millimeters so that's
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.160]   really fish eyes like eight so that's really close this is a ceramic back I got the kind of the
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:46.640]   premium one and I wish Apple would use ceramic I really like ceramic I have to say it's very it's
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:52.240]   such a classy look it's such a classy feel when you put color into ceramic it's a depth of color
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:59.600]   that you just can't get with anything else it's a it's slippery as hell though yeah I you know I
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.280]   ordered a case but because it's a new phone the case isn't coming till tomorrow and I am just
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.960]   I'm but you want to see it at the first at least for the first few days yeah you want to see what
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.840]   you paid for boy am I careful paid for is right because this is the top of the line with ceramic
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.080]   back a terra by internal storage which is funny because I usually you can still put an SD card and
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.640]   by habit I had the camera saving pictures to SD and then I realized oh I shouldn't be doing that I
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.520]   have a terra by internal storage let's try to fill it anyway I think it sounds like a lot but
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.920]   you always find a way to find I don't know that's an awful lot and then it's got 12 gigs of ram which
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.400]   is an awful lot of ram I don't know if it needs that much ram I'm sorry go ahead you need a lot
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:41.840]   of ram for the terra by it might be I don't know that's a computer in it's a computer so many more
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:47.920]   ways than a phone has ever been a computer exactly yeah I mean Samsung and Apple both have their they
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:53.600]   both have their own perspectives and identities on how they build their phones apples as always we
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.560]   have the latest not only do it is technology but the technology works as opposed to Samsung which
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.480]   is we got their first and it makes for a great press release but it doesn't actually really
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:09.600]   function but Samsung's attack is always there are some people that feel or actually do need
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.800]   the most powerful device you can actually hold in your hand and stick in a pocket so powerful that
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.040]   you can actually connect a keyboard and a screen to it and really use it almost like a desktop
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:25.280]   computer and that's exactly what the Samsung topped the line gal I do have one recommendation
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.640]   though and that is that nobody should use the facial like turn off the facial thing oh I was
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.280]   watching the list like it's like it's own YouTube videos to unlock the phone yeah but they just
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.880]   leave that off in fact you're fact I turned it off because it was so quickly recognizing anything
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.800]   that looked roughly like me that was just not locked just just just put your hand up there and
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.280]   let's like move your list like that and it'll actually go along you remember that apple was rumored
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.640]   was considering the in-screen fingerprint reader for the iPhone 10 and decided not to do it
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:03.120]   Samsung's bundling in an opt a sub-sonic ultrasonic thank you not an optical
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.680]   ultrasonic reader under the screen and unfortunately I have it set up so it unlocks what I'm at work so
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:16.000]   I should how can I lock it off to figure out a way to lock the thing but it's not great
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.880]   on the other oh there it is I locked it so you see the fingerprint image on the screen
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.800]   and you have to hold it there for a second no it didn't match I have animation that's real pretty
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.640]   yeah but it's not perfect and that's kind of a problem it's a little slower I did get used to it
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.520]   and so they think that's part of it I had to get used to the Qualcomm or the synaptic ultrasonic
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:43.760]   I don't know any either you got to check so maybe you know you could see it's it's a little slower
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:49.600]   than fingerprint anywhere else yeah see it's a little more finicky the 10 he is so fast but you
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.800]   know what I don't mind you just get used to it you get used to it and you get and you live with it
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:01.440]   and I think it's fairly secure and it'll probably speed up over time too the way iPhone worked with
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.720]   with touch ID and face ID it started out kind of slow and even just software updates helped yeah
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:13.360]   increase the speed on that yeah and maybe training to spending more time using it it's getting to
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:20.960]   know your finger I guess my my yes it's not as fast as apples touch ID was it's a little finicky
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.240]   because there's no way to know you just have to look for where to touch it although I guess you
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:31.360]   get used to that part but I don't it's fine you know I got I'm kind of comfortable with it now
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.520]   and so it's usable it's not perfect it's better but it's usable again that's a that's something
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.960]   that you see you really have to appreciate about our iPhones and our iPads that touch ID work
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:49.920]   works straight ahead straight away and I remember there being very more lag inside my head than
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   there was actually inside the CPU face ID the same thing where I've had to learn not I don't have to
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:03.200]   actually pose for the camp pose for the face ID unlock it literally it was like because as soon as
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.240]   I'm looking at the screen it's waiting for me to simply swipe up to to unroll the unroll the screen
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.360]   it's it's that wonderful thing that gives you faith in it and along in the long term so when
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.400]   it even when it does improve you're still totally on board again that's a with that's a weakness with
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.960]   Samsung compared to to Apple they will come out with these things that are kind of working but not
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.080]   quite what they should be and also with Samsung is you don't know if they're committed to continuing
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.240]   to evolve this thing remember that face recognition face unlock is not a something they just unrolled
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.360]   this year this is something that they were made fun of a year to ago when it first came out in
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:48.400]   the first I think was the S was the S9 but a year to ago the I have had no exactly and and it should
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.880]   not when they have their flagship phone you should not still be able to defeat it with the very first
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.600]   trick that would occur to you on how to defeat face ID so that's what that's what's frustrating
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.360]   about Samsung a lot of superlatives that they rightly earned but one of the things that they are
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.080]   always going to be knocked for my eyes that don't come out with a feature and it seems like more of
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.040]   a PR feature than a commitment to actually evolve this technology to make the phone better I'd put
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.240]   it maybe a little bit differently I think because they still also have the antiquated android pattern
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.680]   swiping to unlock it I think that they just give you a variety they this is very Samsung they give
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.480]   you a ton of different ways to do anything and you get to pick and if you want one is more secure you
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:36.400]   can use one's more secure and also like the like there's a big the a lot of people love the S10E
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   because the fingerprint sensor is in the side and it's super super fast but then you can't use it
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.640]   as easily when it's lying on a table because you got to like get to that that finger everything is a
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.360]   is a compromise but I think it's what's hard for people here is that they had the iris scan which
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.680]   was a secure version albeit it had its own limitations and that's gone away and you only
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.720]   took that I guess they didn't because of the notch they didn't have enough
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.240]   they don't yeah they don't have the camera they could have done three they could have done three
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   holes the way you got what you got the two go for the swiping the notch does not bother me it's
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.920]   basically where the notifications are just means a notification is slid over people just complain
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:14.240]   so much about not just whole points and but no even even if I open like the calendar app where
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:20.080]   you can see the notch it's not a big deal I don't think the big speed button to be remapped now I
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.840]   remapped it to hang out so I can put my text messages pop up much faster that's nice you can't
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:31.280]   remap it to google assistant which would be nice but I have to say Bixby is you know I can double
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.800]   tap to get Bixby and Bixby has gotten much better and is much more useful including routines that
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:41.360]   are very much like apple shortcuts so I have routines for instance this phone is now in the
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:47.840]   work routine that's why it's unlocked and it puts do not disturb on so very much like apple
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.560]   shortcuts you can have location based routines it can have voice triggered routines so they've
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.480]   definitely kind of noticed what apple's doing with shortcuts and duplicates to some degree
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.760]   I was that's that's what I was going to say I mean I know that apple believes that clicky buttons and
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:09.440]   anything that marrs the the purity of an unbroken surface is an athama but if you if they gave us
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:15.040]   one button that that was easy to get to physically on the on the edge of the device that we could
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:22.560]   just simply map to any shortcut we want or any or any of us actually how yeah it's one of those
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:29.520]   things that would do so much to make your phone your phone yeah because every it's it's great to
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:35.920]   it's great that it's a double tap the power button has become almost universal action on every phone
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.480]   to launch the camera app but there's a lot of people for whom their to-do list is their camera app it's
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.760]   like the thing that they're probably picking up the phone to do and to be able to give your give
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:51.280]   first priority first level of access to that boy with that would be a great thing that would be
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.840]   maybe I'll map it to the camera I come to think of it that might be better the other thing I do
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:02.240]   really like about android in general and I think Samsung does this very well it's the ultimately
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.400]   customizable so I've really made this phone my own in a way I just can't do
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.360]   with the iPhone partly that's widgets so I have a lot I use widgets an awful lot
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.560]   so I have a lot of widgets a calendar widget and you know all sorts of different stuff on here
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   that makes it very easy for me to see at a glance what's going on I am using a different launcher
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.200]   too apple you're stuck with springboard but with the android there are a variety of launchers I
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.520]   don't like the Samsung launcher but that's not a problem I can have a launcher that says all my
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:37.760]   music on here this has all my apps on this side I can customize it and a Samsung still has that
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:43.520]   edge menu which I find actually useful and if I in a constrained way if I use it in a certain way
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:49.360]   and I really love this I only have two rows of icons but the action launcher that I use allows
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:55.120]   me to either tap the the icon to run that program or swipe down and open it it's actually a hidden
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.560]   folder that contains the apps in that category so it's a very I can get to every app very quickly
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.520]   and easily right from the front of the screen that kind of customization I wish apple would put in
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.720]   and it's awful or right I don't know if lory remembers this but we hired a new high two writer
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   two years ago and she turned in all these articles and she had a Samsung phone and every one of the
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:23.040]   screenshots had a lined paper background with comic songs typeface so you have to use that
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:29.920]   to do it that's the point yes but with great power with great customization responsibility I
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.080]   understand no the rumors for a while that apple was doing that big redesign and one of the reasons
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.760]   why we didn't get dark mode was because they were working on a larger theme kit and I don't know
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:43.920]   that'll be ready for iOS 13 we're thinking it'll ever go as far as what android does but they're
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.480]   like iOS is on version 12 and there's no font management like adobe is going to have to do their
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.520]   own cloud based fonts because there's no concept of font management among other things on iOS and
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.760]   those are problems that as the system grows up are just not tenable so hopefully we will get like
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.640]   that theme kit and that font can have a little bit of the fun long offered not only a font manager
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.960]   but a variety of fonts I actually don't use the standard font I like the fonts like marker felt
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:12.400]   not comic songs yeah at least you know if you wanted comic sand and then just don't understand
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:20.240]   irony she just wonder what the ironic songs ironic songs but there's it's that's another
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.480]   against this is an apple show so it's so I keep coming back to like there is these are these
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.440]   signature differences between apple and android and samsung which is kind of its own brand almost
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.400]   that I love it I love my android phone because like you said I can't change whatever is that bugs
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:40.720]   me about it I can probably change it but apples stance has always been most people want it to work
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:47.680]   and they're not fixated on making sure it gets to be 99% exactly how they want it to work if the
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:54.080]   manufacturer can get it to 85 to 90% and but that's how it works out of the box and there's no way
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.800]   to screw it up that's a feature for I think the I think the majority of the people out there again
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:04.320]   I value android for for your customizability but I wonder how many people are even aware of that
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:09.680]   you can add widgets to a home screen or that you can install an alternative launcher believe me the
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.200]   magic when people when people ask me oh well I'm surprised using android phone why do you use it
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.560]   and I show them a couple of features they're like oh my god I never know wow that's great well
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.360]   what kind of phone do you have well I have a I have an HTC well okay well you can get this launcher
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:35.440]   that does the exact same thing in your so I we actually live that drama every day in my house because
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:41.760]   you know I'll show Lisa this and she said that's really great I'd love that but I don't want to I
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:48.160]   am not a person who wants to spend one second customizing my phone she says and she's very happy
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.600]   in fact I am very happy with the iPhone until I go to something like this and I spend I literally
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:53:00.480]   this is five days worth of tweaking digging within the menus you can you can tweak a Samsung forever
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.760]   and I spend very little time tweaking my iPhone but now when I go back to it I go oh oh it can't do
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:15.600]   that that's exactly what we're talking about is this argument that we should stop saying things like
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:22.160]   iOS is bad because X and and Android is bad because why is like they're meant for different types of
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:27.440]   personalities and and we should embrace those instead of saying my phone's better than yours or my
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   operating system is better than yours because it does it different and I love the Android
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.920]   operating system but I use an iPhone that's my my main driver and I love the Android operating
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.720]   system exactly for what you're talking about which is that you can have more customized
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:49.440]   stuff and they also do a beautiful user interface while giving you more access to your to your
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:56.400]   customizations but I don't do that I don't spend five days customizing my my my software so
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.120]   iPhone is the thing that gives me what I want yep yeah you're you're totally right and all the
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:08.080]   in on just just the presence of of Apple and the iPhone drives Android to become better and
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.880]   the hardware become better the presence of Android and Android and Android hardware drives Apple to
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.360]   make the iPhone better it's it's great it's great for consumers yeah I was just gonna say that I
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.520]   was all in like previously before the iPhone was introduced I was all in on I had Windows I had
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:28.240]   Xbox I had both Windows mobile and palm phones and I would spend hours tweaking everything like
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.440]   I would make my when they announced the iPhone I made my trio look like an iPhone because I
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:35.840]   couldn't get an iPhone yet and you could do that and then when I was at work and I just like I got
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:41.040]   a new machine and the it was Windows Vista and the machine from Dell shipped with a graphics card
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:45.680]   that had no driver on the machine so it just wouldn't boot and the IT guy who was running Linux at
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.080]   the time said look we're just getting you a Mac because like you you say you enjoy doing this but
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.920]   you're nothing but angry all the time and I think if you wouldn't if you weren't physically able to
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.960]   do it you would just shut up and work and that'd be better for all of us true that's a good point
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.720]   there's maybe the reason why you love Apple is that doesn't judge you it doesn't point out the
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   flaws in your own personality what to do yeah yeah anyway I mean it's kind of nice that Samsung
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.360]   releases these phones kind of midway through the lifespan of the iPhone because it gives you some
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.560]   ideas of what the next iPhone for instance I think three lenses really are a nice feature there was
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:29.920]   a rumor that iOS 13 might allow you to customize or modify the springboard on an iPad this is a
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   really good example a springboard hasn't really changed substantially in years the last big feature
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:41.360]   update was the ability to add folders and it really doesn't use the real estate on an iPad well
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:49.440]   or efficiently at all there was a rumor that perhaps the next version of iOS would allow you to do that
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:54.560]   credible was it was rumored for iOS 12 but then they went into that performance kick and that was
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.880]   a real deal like they took the best engineers like the people who made springboard the people
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.000]   or you know there's different people make it but the people who worked on collection views and the
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.080]   people who worked on auto layout and had them optimize a framework so those people were literally
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:13.280]   not available to do any further work on it but it's supposedly been pushed off to this year
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.600]   where we will see primarily for iPhone for iPad although I would think that iPhone needs some love
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.560]   in springboard too because that it is aging and it's no longer up to the task of everything
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.000]   we want to do with it but it's super interesting because like Phrasor Spears had a really good
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.280]   article a couple days ago about how iPad multitasking had failed him like it was just too complicated
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.360]   swipe up swipe up again he did it wrong gonna try again the apps not in the dock and all these
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.720]   different things and you know a lot of people said oh you know apples lost it they used to be simple
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.600]   and that's a fair criticism but if you go back to like the Greg Christie Bazz ordling um
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.960]   in wrench outer e-time they didn't have to solve problems like multi-window apps either
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.440]   I mean it's in how they would do it but they there's a level of complexity now and the split
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:00.560]   for the split view version on Mac is just abandonware but Windows has done really interesting stuff with
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:04.880]   different management systems and some of the Android devices as well and it seems like there's
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.480]   if you take some really really good people and you apply them to how do we and how do we add these
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.680]   admittedly complex features but keep the interaction models simple and easy for everyone to do
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.240]   you know and you really you do like the stuff that was written about in creative selection you do a
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.200]   lot of real hardcore dog fooding on it um I'm hopeful that we could get something really good
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.680]   out of them this June yeah and the pressure is definitely on them to improve this sort of thing
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.720]   particularly for the iPad as they continue to position it as here is why you shouldn't buy a
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.360]   Chromebook here is why you shouldn't buy a thousand dollar a sub thousand dollar Windows machine
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:45.040]   because we've got a machine that is not just as powerful it is more powerful and the build quality
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:50.640]   is going to be way better and the level of the mobile software that well adapted towards uh use
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.040]   of a bluetooth keyboard is going to be so you're gonna be so much happier with this it's all the
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:01.840]   stability and security of a Chromebook while still having the productivity and flexibility
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.640]   uh of a Microsoft Surface and a lot of the missing pieces are exactly what Frigorous
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:12.000]   Spears was talking about it's the ability to manage multiple apps manage a workflow where
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.560]   Apple can't really predict how I'm going to want to set up my apps my resources for this one project
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:24.160]   I have to do this morning and then quickly adapt this iPad for what the separate project I'm going
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:31.120]   to be working on after lunch and so that's definitely a place where the iPad has let me down I don't
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:38.720]   I I'm still like a daily iPad user but I still do not instinctively know how do I do split screen
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:45.360]   now how do I move uh why is this now a floating window as opposed to I actually want this to be
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:50.800]   in a split a split section of the screen now I used to know how to do that now I now I still
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.200]   have to fumble a couple times before I get it right when is the uh I'm just looking trying to find
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:06.320]   uh when is the beta of 13 come out June 2nd okay yeah WWC right at WWC so we anything we hear
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.400]   now is speculation but uh I am June 3rd I am really looking forward to that I feel and I've
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:18.320]   said this a couple of times that I love my iPad Pro 12.9 inch iPad Pro but it is great hardware
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:24.160]   hobbled by uh in you know inadequate software yeah and the biggest challenge is to make you happy
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.920]   and you know someone who really doesn't like computers but that's the thing that's what Apple
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.320]   is true like my sister for a very like my sister is brilliant she's director of psychology at a
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:37.840]   hospital she's really smart uh but she uses her iPhone primarily to play music to make phone calls
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:43.360]   and to um barely to text like she doesn't know idea what control center is doesn't want to know
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:47.600]   it doesn't want to know what notification center is and any of those things would just get in her way
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:54.080]   so to be able to make it like be what a wide range of customers that's you know I'm glad it's not
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:59.440]   my problem but it's absolutely their job it's a challenge uh you know I noticed though that Lisa
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:06.880]   who is uh kind of more like your sister uh rejects the iPad for serious work she always ends up saying
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.320]   I gotta get my MacBook Air because it's hard for her to do the things she needs to do like like um
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.120]   proposals you know partly that's because Google uh Docs is not very good on the iPad for years has
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.760]   been horrific on the iPad I don't know if that's intentional or uh or not it might be intentional
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.920]   yeah yeah maybe huh what do you think I mean no they're brilliant they're brilliant
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.640]   other numbers and I keep looking at the like I've asked every which way you can ask a question
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.960]   about the capabilities of iPads Safari and they're like we could write anything we want for this
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.160]   yeah you know but it might not be a priority for them they might look at the iPad numbers and say
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.880]   look we're happy to support Chrome and if it's not Chrome then you get whatever it's not Chrome
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:50.960]   experience also also to be fair I put a lot of time in on uh on my pixel book an actual Chromebook
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.000]   and this chrome and the modern Chromebooks can run Android apps from the Google Play Store as well
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.240]   as web apps uh and I find myself I do have the Google Docs app installed as an Android app but
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.360]   I find myself gravitating towards the web version because yeah it just works better
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.280]   as a full screen app as opposed to an app that's designed for a phone screen but then could
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:19.360]   scale up to a tablet size so maybe it's not so much they're tanking their own apps on iOS so much as
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:26.960]   they they they they speak they they speak the language of the mobile app very very well but
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.960]   their first language will always be web apps Chrome I was I had a really funny experience I was on
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:38.240]   I was on a call with Laurie earlier in Chrome and Chrome froze and it froze every electron app on
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.120]   my computer oh Skype and Slack all at the same time I don't know what happened but I couldn't you
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.320]   I had to like restart the whole thing that's not supposed to happen no and it was actually
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.360]   like point out that Google Drive aside Google's apps on iOS are very good in some cases better
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:02.640]   than their Android versions so it's you know I mean maps on iOS is excellent um I think iPhone
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.120]   because like I think specifically iPhone is really worth their while because it has such huge market
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.840]   share and such valuable eyeballs but when it comes to the priority of iPad it's probably you know we
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.320]   do we do the web we do Chrome which is not quite the web but we do Chrome then we try to make it work
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.480]   on other browsers depending on how popular they are then we do iPhone and then you know maybe
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:27.040]   Android and then probably iPad comes in one or two steps underneath that I wouldn't be so sure
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.240]   because I wouldn't be so sure how many like Renee and Laurie how many times have you like talked to
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.400]   developers and found out like the reason why they decided to do an iPad version of their popular
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.440]   desktop app was because everybody in their everybody in their shop bought iPads and they let the
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.760]   developers love their iPads and they want to do more things on their iPads I wouldn't be surprised
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.240]   if I'm sure that in Mountain View on the count on the Google campus if they have the option of
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.600]   not using a Google tab an Android powered tablet and they could use an iPad they'll definitely be
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:09.440]   using that iPad instead I've used both and I'll get Chromebooks let's see Ming Chi Kuo says Apple is
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:17.360]   going to start get ready for this manufacturing and AR headset but don't get ready too soon because it
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:24.320]   won't be till the end of this year or early next soon Leo that sounds soon it does sound soon it's
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:32.160]   sooner than I would have thought what what what do you is incredible does he does he mean in quantity
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:40.000]   or does he mean mass production mass production okay that that's that feels early to me because I
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.800]   don't know again it's almost like the conversation that we were having about an Apple video service
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.960]   is that I'm sure that if they were to make one I'm sure that they would have good reasons to and
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.800]   they would do something wonderful with it and they have a business model for it I don't under
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:02.400]   knowing what I know about wearable come not not technology or the finished products are out there
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.080]   but the actual components that are available to design from I find it hard to imagine Apple
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   looking at the device they could build this time next year and decide that yeah we want an apple
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.960]   logo on that or yes we want someone to point to that person on the subway wearing one of those
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.600]   things and know that they're an apple user they'd much rather make fun of people wearing google
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.280]   last they'd much rather uh they'd much rather uh look at other companies that are doing things that
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:36.240]   are now have two or three years of age to them like hollow lens and they're still not not inconspicuous
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:43.360]   they're also not delivering on what we imagine AR was going to be it's still as much as as well
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.360]   as it integrates into your field of view you're still basically looking at one narrow gauge mail
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.400]   slot in which they could augment your reality and they can't do anything with your peripheral vision
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.440]   so it's it's hard for me imagine apple shipping something that I would think of as an apple product
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:06.880]   anytime in the next year or two well traditionally they don't test in public right so it's not
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.160]   I mean any other company you would have looked how long microsusp and testing hollow lens
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.880]   I mean this most recent version is four years old the one they just announced last month
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:23.440]   and I guess it's their a consumer version although it's 3,500 bucks and it's definitely not and it
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.400]   aimed at end users same to business so they're in my opinion still testing it
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.560]   magically it is definitely in developer mode but they're doing it in public in in some cases apple
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.920]   just doesn't do that right they're not going to release it developers using the iPhone to
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.080]   yeah they're using the iPhone to do it in public they're using AR kit and animoji and stuff to
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.960]   get us used to operating in augmented spaces and with augmented avatar it's sort of very slowly
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.280]   boiling us like frogs instead of destroying us into a boiling pot the way like some of the big
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:56.320]   headsets do but that tech and even these rumors suggest that this this device is going to heavily
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.320]   rely on the iPhone more than even the original apple watch did because all the compute all the
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.240]   render everything is going to be done on the iPhone and then I imagine there'll be an untethered
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.440]   connection that spits it out onto the lenses in front of you but the lenses will still have to capture
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.480]   a bunch of information just to in order to be spatially correct and because you're not going to want to
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.440]   walk around with your iPhone at chest level to sort of like the data spigot so I mean there's
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.520]   there sounds like there's still profound engineering and there's possible that apple's
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.080]   special projects teams have figured out a lot of this stuff maybe they licked it maybe they've
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.640]   licked it it seems early to me it does seem it seems like someone who's had a lot of this stuff
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.720]   yeah we haven't yet seen anything from anybody including magically been hollow lens
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.600]   that is anywhere near a consumer product yeah or snapchat again it's none of that is near a
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.960]   consumer product and I wouldn't expect apple to do anything less than a consumer product then
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:53.360]   like at least an apple watch level apple glasses yeah it's it's so it's so easy to integrate a camera
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:07:00.800]   into a set of eyeglass frames a display device again I just haven't seen anything outside of a lab
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:07.440]   that is capable of giving you something even even if you're going to wear like nerd glasses
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.760]   that you that will not call attention to itself to say nothing of the problem of what if you don't
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.120]   naturally wear glasses I have an advantage I can switch to again then the nerd frames if I want
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:25.440]   thicker nerd frames and that that that hides things inside the circuitry but what if you don't need
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.080]   what if you're one of those horribly disadvantaged people with perfect vision that did not get make
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.840]   fun of and don't have to keep wiping lenses every single every single 10 minutes
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:40.000]   I again I just don't know how that really works would be really interesting but they slip up
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.240]   let's make a part yeah you partner with Ray bands the way you partner with her make them sun glasses
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.760]   yes that you know that that's something I was actually thinking of I'm remember how they they
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.920]   created so many links into the fashion and design communities but they when they originally did
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.720]   the apple watch I would not be surprised at all if they were already working with designers to say
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.520]   on here's how to make this thing palatable and also when we've they've got their eyes five years in
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:09.840]   the future here are special design frames so that just like there's only one style of apple
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.520]   watch he said pointing at an absolutely bare wrist I know but but the thing is when everyone's when
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.240]   we see it you see that you're oh that person's obviously wearing an apple watch if it became just
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.960]   like people know that you're wearing airpods or at least they did until China started knocking
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   off the design for really really bad bluetooth earphones but they could do the exact same thing
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.120]   where one of the ways they could make it palatable is that yes you're wearing this device on the
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.720]   side of your on the side of your head but hey look it's one of those apple things so it could
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:45.760]   actually be a brand identity thing for them so apple sunglasses they just happen to have AR I
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.520]   like that I mean I like the Dwayne Wayne idea that Leo had yeah flip them up flip them up I do think
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.920]   I mean this I mean I'm so nostalgic for the apple that like would release something and
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.880]   everybody gasped and it changed the world and the iPhone was one of those things that iPad to
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:10.320]   some degree iPod for sure but in all three cases they weren't new products in a category but what
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.040]   I remember like Microsoft ran to get the HP slayed out at CES right before the iPad and it had like a
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:22.400]   little push button ejector for the window sticker yeah so imagine that apple has somehow you know
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:28.240]   amazingly come up with some solution and we'll all talk back you know think back oh remember
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:34.320]   it 20 march 2020 when apple released these and it changed the world right I mean I think that
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.720]   I would like to see that let's let's let's all root for apple to do that I think that'd be really
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:44.320]   cool if anyone could do it it would be apple or possible Samsung but is that a fair thing to
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.200]   say these days I think that's true maybe was true in the past but we haven't seen I think apple is
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.440]   still unique in their ability to take take a bunch of disparate technologies and package it in a way
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   that's really accessible to mainstream customers that's always seems to be in their secret sauce
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:03.040]   like again like tons of phones before iPhone tons of tablets before iPad a few watches before apple
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.240]   watch bunch of bluetooth headsets before AirPods but they seem to be able to carve down not to
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.560]   everyone's liking but to like a single opinionated view of what this product can be for a wide swath
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.040]   of that's kind of been a that's kind of a downhill slope you just described you had the iPhone
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:27.840]   and the iPad the apple lunch in the AirPods yeah nothing I mean it's kind of yeah but
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.280]   is there not the apple that of of 15 years ago or 10 years ago I mean I we're also mature more
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.400]   like more mature technology it's hard to call up with like flying cars I mean it's like a big one but
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.800]   well speaking of cars apple may still well be in the car business that we talked about the layoffs but
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.520]   Mike Elgin wrote actually I thought a very good piece in computer world his predictions
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.600]   for apples self-driving future and among other things he said people are getting a lot of it
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:01.840]   wrong he said apples not killing off its self-driving car program when you have 5,000 employees working
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.280]   at least part-time on Titan and 1200 full-time employees laying off 200 isn't that significant
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:15.120]   it's false you know he says people point to the high disengagement rate of apples self-driving
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:22.720]   cars much higher than anybody else including Google only uber is worse but he says but we don't
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.960]   know if apples may be being as they often are over cautious maybe they disengage more
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.400]   than necessary because they don't want you know they're being conservative in their approach in fact
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:40.240]   apple did tell the DMV that in when they told him that is not true I didn't even know this was a
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.840]   rumor that apple has a secret former military base test track outside Silicon Valley that is
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.400]   not true apple self-driving car may not even be a car mike elken says it probably will be a little
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.440]   a van that's basically a rolling living room I like this one I like that that little descriptor I've
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:06.880]   in the couple of times I've seen self-driving cars there there's this this prototype that looks sort
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.400]   of like a bus with a bunch of windows it's small you know like a van but it's all windows and
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.960]   there's no seats that all face directly forward some of them face backward and there's a table in
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.440]   the middle so it's more like riding in a train car or something like that because you don't need
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:28.400]   somebody facing forward driving the car so why not just mix it up and make make the thing that
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.120]   you're sitting in to transport you into whatever you want it to be I love this idea the first
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.400]   automobiles looked a lot like carriages horse driven carriages and they slowly morphed into
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.880]   something a little more appropriate to the form factor why should a self-driving car look like a
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:49.280]   car that you have to drive well also because like Sammy Davis Jr. lost an eye because of things sticking
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.160]   out of the dashboard and people were people without seat belts and without with this club
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:00.000]   car kind of a car design people getting it again being thrust against tables and getting killed
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.080]   unnecessarily it's it's it's there's a lot of debate about what kind of safety regulations
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:12.000]   are important to hold over for a self-driving car and which ones they can actually do away with
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.560]   and with the thought that if there if this passenger is unrestrained perhaps we can perhaps we can
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:24.480]   offset that with the additional safety of certifying the self-driving technology as ways to that
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.080]   they're never going to fall asleep they're never going to be exceeding the speed limit
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.080]   and they're going to be able to get out of almost any jam that any bad driver puts them in
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.880]   well I would like I can't wait to get my augmented reality glasses in my self-driving living room
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   they're not separate things Leo aren't you getting this yet you get into the van and it shows you
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:49.760]   Jurassic Park dinosaurs as you commute to work they're one thing it's a vehicle it's a movie theater
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:56.480]   it's a restaurant it's a vehicle it's a movie theater it's a restaurant okay that's the uh
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.840]   keynote I do want an invitation to yes if you could pull some strings for yeah let's take a little
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:08.400]   break uh we got more to come Renee Richie and Laurie Gil from iMore Andy and I go from Boston public
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.560]   radio great to have all three of you this is a nice a nice team what do you think guys should we
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:22.320]   allow girls on Mac break weekly oh allow what I think just say we had a sign on the door is that
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:28.880]   no girls allowed I think I could take that down now that's a good idea yes I think you're right it's
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.400]   gonna be Laurie Christina Warren and a couple of other people Leo will barely get invited done
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:39.840]   that with tWIT and it's wonderful I just sit back and let it go it's so great um yes soon you won't need
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:46.560]   any men anymore I think Partha Genesis is just around the corner did you read why the last man
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:51.200]   where is his whole comic strip uh I forget if it's Kirkman or Vaughn who did it but the whole thesis
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.600]   is that there are two sexes until they invent cloning and as soon as cloning is invented just
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:01.280]   all the men are destroyed yeah because you don't need them anymore exactly that's it if if slugs
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:08.560]   can do it why can't we are sure today brought to you by cap terra we uh you know I fear looking
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.240]   for business software and by the way a lot of you ought to be I still get calls from all the time
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:21.040]   for people saying well you know I I've got a 10 year old Mac and it can only go to snow leopard
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.640]   but I can't get rid of it because it's the only thing that will run our heating and air conditioning
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.600]   software or I manage my my veterinary business on a windows 95 computer but I have to because
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.440]   they haven't updated the software in 20 years things like that no there's great business software

[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.600]   dot com from real users of the software you're looking at so it's like going it's like going out
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.160]   there and saying hey what do you think of finding out from hundreds of people who use that program

[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:50.080]   hey happy birthday too well if you go to google.com you'll know 30th birthday what do you anybody
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:57.600]   want i guess do you know yeah web yeah the world wide angle bracket blink angle bracket happy
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.600]   birthday angle bracket slash blink at the great google doodle uh today for the worldwide web
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.200]   the only thing they've got wrong is that really should be a black next cube not an IBM PC but i
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:16.240]   guess for many of us it was an IBM PC we ran our first a worldwide web browser on 30 years ago
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:23.200]   is it uh is it 30 years ago the Tim Berners Lee the inventor worldwide web put his first web page up
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.480]   what what is the actual anniversary do you know better not be geo cities launching better not be
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:35.600]   the first cat videos oh it's the it's the first time that a monkey got punched
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:43.680]   let's see because he was he was a he's a physicist he was working at CERN the Geneva
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:51.600]   particle lab and they had a bunch of networked computers and he wrote it okay so this is the
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:59.920]   anniversary of his proposal march 1989 for quote a large hypertext database with typed links
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.880]   there wasn't a lot of interest initially i'm reading from wikipedia but Berners
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.240]   lee was encouraged by his boss mike send all to begin implementing the system on a newly acquired
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:16.160]   next workstation so you see yeah steve jobs is involved even here there's the next cube
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.440]   that he used the first this is i think is this is that the computer history museum
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:26.560]   celio apple doesn't always create the disruption themselves but they make the tools
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:33.840]   for which the world can be disrupted exactly there you go um so i'm not sure when the first page went
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:39.600]   up i think it was christmas 1990 so we're going to have another 30th anniversary to celebrate but
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:51.360]   this is the 30th anniversary for information management a proposal march 1989 and this is this is uh
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:20:02.000]   this is the uh in fact he says this is from him uh at w3.org and he says this is the html file
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.240]   generated from the rtf file by microsoft word you want to see it here you go he says he can't
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.760]   open the word file anymore but at least you can see this and some of it's not so good not so good
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.200]   but uh you know style equal style style magnetic style html version that looks a little bit better
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:28.080]   and apple apple is like if if they were a dna test and more morey povich would wind up like
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:33.360]   giving apple news that it's now is way way behind on his payments uh because it's not not just the
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:39.120]   connection to next but uh remember that uh it was an expression of an old concept of hypertext
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:45.520]   that had been around since like the late sixties early seventies and of which uh hypercard was really
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:51.760]   one of the first right practical consumer uh facing things that actually did hypertext really
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.560]   there's very very little difference between a lot of different hypercard stacks and a modern web page
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.200]   which is that's why it continues to frustrate me there isn't a web version of hypercards made by
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:08.240]   apple yes uh bill Atkinson did release the hypercard software to the computer history museum if you
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:14.160]   want to Andy you want to start working on it good make that happen i get i get you think that i'm
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.360]   smart enough to be able to understand and you fill out in since code i'm so flat as you think so
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:26.240]   oh wait a semicolon i know what a semicolon is i just don't know anything before that uh and by
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:31.360]   the way Tim Berners-Lee said this would provide an excellent project with it to try our new object
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:40.640]   oriented programming techniques whoo whoo whoo I think it was Ted Nelson actually in fact Berners-Lee
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:49.680]   refers to Ted Nelson's 1967 piece getting it out of our system in information retrieval a critical
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:55.600]   review uh Ted Nelson really was the guy i think who coined the term hypertext and was the first to
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:01.360]   propose this idea of linking he uh we had him on triangulation not so long ago he's still as far
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:08.240]   as i know lives in a houseboat in sausoleito not so far away from here and yeah hypercard absolutely
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.200]   must have been a big um influence on Tim Berners-Lee right hypercard yeah he must have used it
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:22.240]   anyway happy birthday worldwide we're not the internet people are saying it's the internet's
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:28.560]   birthday no no just the worldwide web just that idea just the www just the www dark i get no cake
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:37.280]   today no cake for you today dark i knew and on this date we can all we can revel in the classic
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:43.280]   joke that never gets any old lewitt engineers to come up with an acronym that shortens a word but
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:49.680]   actually makes it three times longer longer syllables worldwide web or www three syllables
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:59.040]   versus nine excellent point Andrew so um i guess uh we should probably talk about this elizabeth warren
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:05.120]   candidate for uh democratic nomination for president in 2020 the elections coming
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:12.560]   says uh we should break up the tech giants including apple i don't think she thought out the apple part
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.320]   all that well and i would point you to as always a great ben tomsen article in stratecary
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:29.680]   in which he says warren is wrong um he does praise her for kind of thinking about how much power our
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:36.240]   big tech companies have too much power over our economy he just says that breaking them up may have
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:42.880]   some really hideous unintended consequences and i kind of i kind of agree so i i had that same thought
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:48.000]   and then i um i inter i talked to niele today for tomorrow's vector so i got a chance to ask him
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.040]   oh good about the interview and the the breakup part is getting a lot of the attention but she
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.160]   seems like she has a four-point plan where depending on how valuable you are different things kick in
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.960]   like if you may i forget the number what if you make only a $29 billion you're cut out yeah you're fine
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:10.080]   well that runs directly contrary to actual us law which doesn't say you're too big you have to be
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:16.560]   broken up yes you have to be a monopoly to be broken up there is no different law that says oh
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.320]   you're uh you're worth a hundred trillion dollars that's you gotta we gotta break you up you're too big
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.040]   us is like common welfare and the uu is competition based they have very different anti-trust systems
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.840]   she's introducing a third one which he thinks could be less expensive than having a but like
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.480]   having a decent price charge of saying yeah well on the value of the company and the size of the
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.920]   ecosystem and again like i don't think any of these ideas scale because uh like can like for example
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.480]   at apple size they should not be allowed in her assertion is they have too much access to data
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.280]   and to positioning to be allowed to offer apps on their own store they should not be allowed to
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.720]   compete yeah this seems to be your biggest problem is which makes this by the way makes zero sense
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:00.960]   but like walmart has access to data and to shelving positions that they're they're like proctoring
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   gamble don't and should mikersoft not be allowed to sell halo should bungee be spun off and you
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.640]   everyone should get a good case to be made that google shouldn't have youtube because it's going
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.240]   to just mess with the search for number one and two search yeah well i think you can make that case
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:24.240]   but i'd just make any sense that apple shouldn't sell apps in its own app store that makes no sense
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:31.360]   at all maybe she wants to say other stores should be able to sell apps on the iPhone that would
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.840]   make more sense that there should be multiple stores well that reduces security significantly
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:42.560]   so yeah see that's that's why this most of the most of what she is she is her campaign has committed to
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:48.720]   is in a medium post that she published or her her election campaign wherever published
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.440]   and one of the points that she's making is that it's particularly as relates to apple is that
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.240]   it's wrong for given that apple makes money off of every purchase off the app stores wrong for
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.640]   them to lock their devices to just one app store they should allow people to either side load apps
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.200]   or at least or allow other app stores to app store apps to be installed on the device
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.480]   so i mean it's it's not as though this what she's saying doesn't make any sense it's just that
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:21.440]   it really does to my eyes it comes across at this point as campaign rhetoric as opposed to a well
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:28.480]   thought out vision of of digital policy i don't i think that in the long run what she's proposing
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:34.160]   is going to hurt more more consumers than it helps because she's trying to apply
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:43.920]   hundred year old ideas of of trust busting to a 2019 technological marketplace and the two
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:50.480]   aren't really compatible and when she does really mention about the breakup of of monopolies she
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.960]   talks about like atnt for instance and the thing is the reason why this was the atnt was originally
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.840]   a government granted monopoly it wasn't that they wasn't like robbed they maybe they acted
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.600]   like robert barons but at some point the government said that atnt until like 1984 you're exempt from
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.640]   antitrust because it's so important that we have this phone system and telegraph system in place
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.320]   as can be so expensive to put in that it will you will reach more people and will become we need
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.640]   this thing built up and the only way to do it is to not have 18 different competing telephone
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.280]   network so it's in the public's best interest to allow this trust to continue i think that it would
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.960]   be appropriate for them to say that there are certain huge huge companies like google but not
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:38.960]   facebook where yes google making so much money off of ads and having so many products that allow
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.560]   them to to place ads and to collect more information to make their ad database more valuable
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.040]   is beneficial to consumers because this book gives us google maps for free this is what gives us
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.640]   google docs for free this what gives us chrome books and android devices that are very very cheap
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.360]   to produce because they are essentially giving away the operating system for free it's a benefit
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:08.800]   it's a big enough benefit to consumers that we can allow this particular company to exist the way it
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.240]   is facebook i think would be a different thing because they apps they just make it so clear that
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.720]   they don't care about anything that they do as long as it keeps keeps the firehose of information
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:29.680]   is for going into the giant holding tanks in facebook's campus so i'm i i'm i prefer to read
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:37.680]   this proposal as again here is a early campaign statement campaign rhetoric thing that if if she
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:44.640]   became the actual democratic nominee she would have to release a very long hundred page pdf
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:51.040]   with all kinds of other academics and engineers who signed off on this thing to actually outline
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:57.120]   how she could do this without ensuring that it doesn't cost us 18 cents a mile to navigate
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:04.640]   using any sort of a google map sort of product this whole campaign i think is is just kind of like
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:09.120]   looking at the wrong things that we need to fight when it comes to technology
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.400]   right now the most important thing that we need to do is protect our our data and our security
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.840]   it should be the procedures and and regulations in place to take care of that not to break up
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.680]   these big tech companies that that that should be so far they're down the line that that she should
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:32.160]   be standing on a platform of of enforcing some sort of methodology toward transparency for
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:38.800]   how these major companies are collecting our data um i i i think that Elizabeth Warren is
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:44.640]   incredible and i think that i'm confused when i read this as to where she came up with this idea
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.600]   to to make this the thing that she stands on right now when there are so many other things that are
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:54.320]   more important that that should be tackled first i think you nailed it absolutely this is the
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:01.120]   wrong battle to fight uh Thompson quotes mike maznick on this he says mike says none of this is to say
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:05.440]   we shouldn't be concerned about big internet companies with too much power it's a perfectly
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.960]   perfectly reasonable concern but just because you want to do something and this is something
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.120]   doesn't mean it's the something we should do and i'd be much more interested in a candidate who had
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   concrete proposals on how to protect our data and our privacy going forward then oh let's just
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:26.480]   let's just chop it all up because the consequences that's a massive undertaking it's probably a
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.000]   non-starter and the consequences are unknown and and undoubtedly significant whereas i think you
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.240]   could reasonably get up uh in front of congress uh a newly elected president and say we've got an
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.000]   enact privacy legislation and we've got to do it now and i think that actually that's the will of
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.200]   the people and the will of most of the congress right now yeah and i i hope this doesn't come across
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:53.920]   as ageist maybe it is i don't think it is but this is why i'm i don't think our next chief executive
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:02.480]   and the majority of our congresspeople should be people who are 69 or 70 years old uh it's the fact
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:10.240]   that she her first huge public statement about this uses the language of antitrust which is
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:19.360]   something that has been a known problem for decades as opposed to the subtleties of technology i think
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:25.040]   is a little telling and at least prejudices me to continue to think that even people who are my age
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.920]   i'm generation x uh which means that i grew up with computers i grew up with the internet even i
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:36.080]   grew up with that with email i just but i absolutely didn't i absolutely did not grow up with a device
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:41.440]   in my pocket that keeps me connected all the time i didn't uh it took me so it took me a little while
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.800]   even to get the hang of text messaging because i didn't know do i have to say goodbye no really
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.080]   the conversation just even if we don't continue this conversation for 10 days it's all one conversation
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:56.960]   wow and that these are things that oh you have to grow up with a tech with a certain thing you have
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:02.640]   to grow up in a certain world as opposed to getting accustomed to a new world when it comes to making
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:09.600]   policy about how big a tech company should allow to become well what privacy controls where privacy
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:16.240]   rights should be what surveillance rights should be this is where you need somebody who is in their
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:22.640]   30s or 40s or or even younger than that this is not something that's something that i should be doing
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:29.120]   you're exactly right with that uh we have in uh every time something comes up in government where
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:34.240]   they're trying to figure out what technology is doing and they go and they ask all those questions
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:39.600]   in the in their meetings and their hearings it's terrible because they don't know what they're
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:46.160]   talking about but the the younger people come up and and join the government officials they know a
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:50.800]   lot more than these older generations do about how to navigate technology and they have just a better
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.720]   understanding of it just because like you said they grew up with phones in their pockets they were
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:00.560]   five when they started using technology as opposed to 15 or something like that and right now the
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:06.880]   people that are in office don't understand technology enough to even ask the right questions to get
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:13.120]   to the right place they're just kind of in this big you know what are you doing what do you do how
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:18.160]   come how come the when i do a search on google what i look for doesn't come up well you don't
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:24.480]   we don't know it technology is so much bigger and deeper than that and we definitely need
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:30.000]   younger generations that will grow up in into these government officials that have a much better
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.600]   understanding of the way technology works before we can start attacking
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:38.800]   how they're doing business and what they can do what they what they should be doing differently
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.800]   uh i am almost a level 40 and pokemon go more importantly
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:54.400]   Lisa the audience Leo is the Leo is still very very young youthful and fresh thinking i just want
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.720]   to say i want to get the 40 because any second now right wizards unite is it going to come out
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:10.320]   and it's all over for pokemon go um niantic gave previews to a number of uh game blogs and so
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:17.920]   forth and uh i know that you are paying close attention at imore.com because of course you are
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:24.080]   the headquarters for pokemon go information rene what do we know about harry potter wizards
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:30.160]   united's based on the niantic ingress slash pokemon go platform yeah so i mean android central
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.040]   android site covered ingress a lot and we've covered pokemon go but i have to admit i'm still
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.480]   pokemon going so lory uh with russell holly and luke uh philipovate has been doing all the wizard
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:47.360]   united stuff so before she says glory then yeah oh look at me and say you know i don't know like
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.360]   curse me and have my pokemon shrivel and die you know adavakadavra pikachu and wait a minute i did not
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:59.520]   know that lory gill was the wizard unite expert well well now there's a couple of us that are
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:04.880]   trying to be expert so that that poor rene doesn't get trapped doing actually luke philipovitch is
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.560]   is he's doing some heavy coverage of it and we've got him on on board to his article and i'm
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.920]   more yeah yeah and he will hopefully be the rene ritchie of of wizard unite but it does
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:23.040]   say first i thought they would just skin pokemon go and turn gyms into castles and stops into i don't
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.120]   know that's like sort of but there but the next really a different it looks like a very play a
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.080]   play it looks very very very different but i have said i am on record is saying if you thought the
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:39.440]   pokemon go craze of july 2016 was out of control you ain't seen nothing yeah that's why they made
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.040]   that's why they made the last movie to sort of temper down the servers oh so lory do we know
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:51.120]   when it looks like it's getting close it is definitely getting close but no they're they're not even
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:57.440]   close to giving us an idea of when but you can see from from the harry potter wizards unite website
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:03.840]   that there's some gameplay that they're sharing with us now um so it gives us the if i were to guess
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:11.840]   based on how how pokemon go started and this is definitely just a big huge guess i would say this
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.120]   summer and i'm i'm only basing that on the gameplay that they're they're showing us which
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.240]   means that they're far enough you're gonna play outside right you do you have to play outside it's
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:27.280]   um some of this so it's the same basic mechanics that you get from pokemon go and ingress
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.520]   which is that you do have to navigate the world around you but there's going to be quite a few
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:38.400]   different things that you'll come across and it's not just a matter of sort of spinning a um a stop
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:45.440]   to to gather some goodies um there's the the thing that i'm seeing that i that i find most
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:51.360]   interesting is that you can drop a port key which in the wizarding world of harry potter a port key
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   transports you from one location to another so there's this um augmented reality version of a
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:03.200]   port key that you can drop and then it looks like you'll be able to just sort of enter a world where
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:09.440]   you'll even though you're still in the same park or the same building when you look on your phone
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:16.000]   you'll actually get to see an entirely different view and kind of look around within that view to
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   find what you're looking for i think that's an a nice sort of next level um adding to the the
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.680]   gameplay that's already there um instead of catching pokemon obviously you're trying to capture
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:36.240]   these um magical objects that have somehow accidentally found their way into the real or not real the
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.760]   non-magical world um so that's your version of catching pokemon is catching they're calling them
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:51.200]   uh found foundables foundables is that weird yeah so yes it's made up a new word yeah yeah
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.160]   but you're also going to be doing some battle things instead of um fight like setting up your
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:04.160]   pokemon to battle against each other in the gyms um you'll be going to um fortresses where you will
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:13.840]   perform um uh spells on on other players avatars and this this kind of the based on the view on
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.040]   what they show in the gameplay it's very similar to what you would see in some other harry potter style
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:26.080]   games where you might have to swipe the screen in a certain pattern in order to um activate that
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:32.560]   particular uh spell you have to learn a spell yeah yeah and you might have to use circular motion to
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:39.120]   you know attack them or use a side swipe motion to block them or something like that so it looks
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:46.720]   like that's some slight changes to the um gameplay that we've seen in in ingress and and uh pokemon go
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.880]   but it is a it's a same basic understanding of you have to go outside you have to navigate the
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:59.600]   world around you in order to play well uh if i'm sorry if you're an ios user you're out of luck but
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:06.000]   if you're an android user they are now open for pre-registration which means they may invite you
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.560]   to early access for the game so it is on the android store uh as a pre-register harry potter
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:20.320]   wizards unite i'm gonna pre-register because i want to get out of pokemon go as quickly as i possibly
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:26.800]   can so so lauria and lisa's already told me she's not starting a new game as soon as was you
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.960]   come out she's dropping pokemon go and oh and gonna start taking pictures and enjoying my life
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:40.480]   right now we're in a bitter battle to get to level 40 and she's she's like three million four
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:46.720]   million points ahead of me so i think she's gonna go lisa she's gonna wait i just need to get this
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:53.280]   out there for rene and lauria i understand that uh i'm more is going to be dark for three days
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.800]   around this event uh i'm not i don't play pokemon go and i haven't even read the harry potter
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.720]   book so if you if you need me to come in as just like sort of like when sort of when like captain
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.040]   marvel has to bring in like she hulk or captain america just please do yourself a favor

[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.280]   gotten around to them yet i do i bought i own all of them on kindle and i own like four of them on
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.440]   audible i just have them i feel i feel like it's like it's like when a new niel game
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.480]   in book comes out i don't want to read it in batches on the train i want to here's here's my
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:46.240]   cup here's my pot of tea here's the to be fair the reading lael is actually a much better writer
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.520]   than jk rallying but yeah the harry potter is more a cultural phenomenon than anything else she
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.400]   made a super interesting like her characters in world are super interesting she doesn't render
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.880]   it as well as no i i agree i think there are better far better writers out there but i said this
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:07.520]   when when the first set of harry potter books came out she single-handedly got kids back into
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:13.760]   writing and that hadn't happened in my entire lifetime and i was so happy to see i was working
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.800]   at an elementary school at the time and every child's face was in a book and it was incredible
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.760]   to see that my including my kids and that's probably why i have such a fiction uh for the
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:31.920]   series and by the way you have now seen a direct live illustration of why our republic is in such
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.440]   deep trouble we started talking about you know whether the big tech company should be broken up
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:44.800]   and i went squirrel and you all followed it's it's a it's a Tuesday and we're all getting used to
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:51.440]   the clocks being ahead of our just give us this just for this one show it would be fine i am equally
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.840]   excited about the election and harry potter wizards you know that's all i can say
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:02.880]   one is going to make a bigger impact on society however i think we know which one that will be
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.640]   you know which one harry potter i showed today and besides there's only one that canadians can
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:15.840]   play along uh our show today brought to you by word press i'll tell you what i got off of the
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.640]   social networks in august and uh except for a few brief foolish flirtations have stayed off
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:30.080]   and my antidote to that is my own website at wordpress.com having your own website frankly is
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:34.720]   something everybody should do not just every individual but every business i it breaks my heart
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.360]   when i see businesses say oh but i got a facebook page i don't need a website you need a website you
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:45.440]   need a place to call your own that reflects you exactly that no one could take away from you
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.800]   and it's so easy to do there's no reason not to have a website in fact it even can be done for free
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:57.040]   at wordpress.com but the beauty of wordpress.com is start for free but as you grow as your needs

[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:47.760]   doing you want to make let's make renego first no okay it's up to you no i don't mind i uh you have
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:54.000]   a pick i actually have a really great pick in fact i'm jealous because yours did yours come i'm holding
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.520]   in my hand i'm waiting for mine it's the hyperdrive yes ipad pro comes in the kickstarter version comes
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   in this cute little little kid oh i'm so jealous where is mine i'm sure it's coming soon i don't know
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:12.320]   why i got mine before you got yours i guess because they like me better but the the hyperdrive for
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.960]   anybody who doesn't know what it is it's just it's a hub or a dongle if depending on how you want to
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.680]   word it that comes with a couple of different little gadgets that that connect to your ipad
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:27.600]   pro which previously you couldn't do this kind of stuff and now that ipad pro has usb c there's a
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:34.240]   lot more things that you can connect to it than you used to be able to um it's got a hdmi um usb c
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:45.200]   micro micro SD and SD and uh 3.5 millimeter headphone jack na usb a one of the things believe it or
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:51.120]   not that i ended up liking the most about it was the headphone jack because i realized oh it has a
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:59.360]   headphone jack oh man yeah so it's a great little thing um i i've connected it to my television set
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:06.640]   i've connected it to my monitor using my ipad as you know as the the system that connects to these
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:11.520]   other things it's actually this little thing is pretty great it comes with a couple of different
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:18.960]   tools to help you use it in a different way if you wanted to connect it different i don't i'm not
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:25.680]   sure what the the final package will be when they sell it uh just regularly on their website but
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.240]   through the kickstarter it came with a couple little extras so that you could connect with a
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:36.880]   little bit of an extra leeway so that you don't have to if you're using um a stand or a case that
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.680]   makes it so that this doesn't fit properly you can kind of plug it in this way and connect it like
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:49.440]   that um and it has a different a little different um lever on it so if you're you don't have to use
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.840]   the i you don't have to plug it in one way you can flip it the other way and this little extra
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:59.840]   piece allows you to um decide which side that you want to keep it on depending on the k if you
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:04.800]   are using a case or not so it's a pretty versatile little thing and it has a lot of stuff going to
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:10.000]   it and my favorite is the way it just clicks into the side of your ipad instead of something that
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.880]   hangs off the side it just clicks right in there and acts as sort of a slight extension to your ipad
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.440]   you don't have to worry about it dangling or falling off or anything like that it just sits in right
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:29.200]   there so when did you get yours um it came about two weeks ago so i this is one of the reasons i
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:36.640]   hate kickstarter so i went and oh you didn't fill out the survey yet so uh i ordered two i have uh
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:43.760]   two coming in the early bird special and all that but um so we'll see
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:50.560]   just drives me crazy do i presume you just you know you just fill out the survey right
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:57.440]   well i mean that's nothing against you it's not your fault but and and it it's also very possible
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.480]   that it why yours didn't come in has nothing to do with when you filled up the survey it could be
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.360]   anything well i just filled it out now so it's gonna be oh wait you hadn't filled it out yet until
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.000]   just now no and then after i filled it out which is a dopey survey that's didn't ask for anything
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.520]   important then it said okay we'll let you we'll send you another survey when we're gonna when the
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:27.120]   thing ends i freaking hate kickstarter yeah i don't have the best results by the way you can't get it
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:33.520]   on kickstarter anymore but it is on indiegogo now i think that's because kickstarter once they
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:38.720]   start shipping it won't let them plug it do anymore yeah it's weird because san o i i
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.800]   i warned or in previous hyper drives they're a known company they make these and that they've
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.040]   just decided this is a better way for them to to sell a product is to do it through kickstarter
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.440]   then you just sell it on retail so yes highly recommended i have their other one and it's
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:58.240]   fantastic and i wish i had this one especially for the headphone jack rene richy pick of the week
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.040]   yes sir so mine is not a new pick i'm sure jason sennell is picked at half a dozen times on this
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.040]   very show at least but uh it's it's getting a little bit of attention again because they're
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:13.120]   doing a promotion and honor of captain marvel and it is marvel unlimited it is it's so trite to say
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.560]   the netflix of something but with this you pay a monthly subscription or i think like you get a
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:23.600]   discount if you play yearly and you get access to massive amounts of the marvel of the marvel
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.640]   not marvel marvel back catalog of titles right now they're showing off a lot of captain marvel stuff
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.880]   because of the movie and there's so many great things there like the crease scroll war all the
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:39.680]   avengers the warbird stuff the herald of galactus that there's just so so many great stories uh in
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.560]   that universe and they do a good job of sort of if you are primarily interested because of the movies
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.320]   they do a really good job of finding you the quintessential stories the ones that the scrup
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.000]   writers and the directors drew from but there's also just everything like all the x-men all the
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.840]   avengers all the fantastic for all the spider-man all the everything that marvel has been producing
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:06.160]   just back to the very very early stanley days and if you are a huge comics nerd the app just works
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:11.600]   great especially on an ipad it's just a phenomenal experience and it's it's so much easier than
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:17.280]   carrying 40 comic boxes around on your back here here here i i i think that i think the marvel has
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.480]   created a really amazing product because it's not just they the fact that they they have been
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:28.320]   assiduously filling in the back catalog every single year to the point where there's almost
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.120]   nothing that you won't hear about if someone on reddit in a comic book form mentions something
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:38.240]   that will a limited series from 1981 is probably on marvel comics unlimited even though it was such
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:43.360]   a bad seller that it's never made it to the trade paperback and the other great thing is that
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:50.720]   it really brought me kind of back around to marvel comics because uh a lot of the stuff that they
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:56.720]   i gotta i have to format this correctly a lot of the a lot of these things that they publish
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:02.320]   are absolutely unreadable because they they do their entire publishing schedule around these
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:08.400]   huge events and so you think that okay great so i'll do the i'll i'll so i'll read this uh 10 issue
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:15.040]   absolute power are uh mini series that the big event like oh well actually no this doesn't tell you
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:21.040]   how this event happened and doesn't end someone will just say wow i just watched this person die
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:25.680]   bummer huh let's move on to the next thing and he had to like buy this other comic and this other
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:31.840]   series to find out how this actually affected this character and it's just horrible but if you so
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:37.600]   it became so i after spending that that's the i'm so i'm so smart that it took me three times of
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:44.560]   spending 60 dollars to try to read one of these series that uh that i suddenly said no no more if
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:50.320]   there's any hint of a of an event i am not even remotely interested in it but with my marvel
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:55.280]   unlimited series i'm willing to wait a year for it to hit marvel unlimited and then i can just say
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:53:00.960]   wait yeah what what the what the hell is quasar talking about flip flip flip flip flip flip okay
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:05.840]   there's now i understand what quasar was talking about and i didn't have to spend four dollars
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.520]   four dollars extra to find that out so yes i just read the old stuff i read so before there
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:14.480]   was because i don't like the cross like the huge crossovers either i just read a lot of the classic
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:19.120]   like the george perez stuff and i'm very much artist driven the arthur adam stuff it and
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:24.720]   starland they're just the most amazing artist the clairmont bernier of bern of uh of x-man the
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:30.160]   bernier of fennard just there's so many pivotal stories in in that collection it's amazing huge
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:34.400]   value and you can download them to the to the ipad app so you don't have to you can still read
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:40.160]   them on the on the on the plane uh really especially for 60 bucks a year that is something that that
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:45.040]   we're talking about uh subscription plans earlier today if you are going to deliver me
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:50.880]   basically every marvel comic ever published with if only a few gaps that i'm willing to spend
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:54.080]   60 dollars a year for that is that that is a very good value proposition
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:54:00.800]   the space that you save alone makes it worth it oh god it's just everything comic solace
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:07.360]   i won't get this into a 30-minute tangent but it's uh if you told me like even when i was like
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:13.600]   25 years old that by the way you know how like you never travel with like comic books because
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:18.000]   you're not going to be able to keep them in good shape on this on this flight and on this flight
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.240]   from boston to san francisco and back again uh you're gonna lose some or you know so you're gonna
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.360]   look like a big frickin nerd like hold i'm in i'm in business class holding up a copy of
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:32.800]   peter parker this spectacular spider-man i don't think so and the ability to say no actually not only
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:38.480]   not only do you have comic books but you uh now have pretty much every comic book you're ever
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:44.720]   interested in ever rereading ever again right there on the device it's like oh i you know what i
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.040]   think i'm gonna start jogging and eating a little better because i want to live to be your age future
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:57.120]   andy speaking of future andy what's your pick of the week sir uh okay my my pick is also a kickstarter
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:04.800]   it doesn't ship until may however it is a vinyl lp with no sound recorded on it it is
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:12.080]   it is i'm not saying that it's a blank lp i mean literally what side one is they
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:17.840]   cut an lp with 20 minutes of silence then you flip it over and you also get another 20 minutes
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:24.400]   of silence it's called silent meditation so that it's like if you want silence to meditate to and i
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:30.640]   i was fully on board when when i read the description where it's half tongue-in-cheeked
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:35.600]   half-serious uh they're saying they're saying so it's this this will this will have the desired
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.240]   effect even if your gift recipient doesn't own an lp it works just as well whether it's playing or
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:48.160]   not playing uh but then i started thinking about how an lp is a record player is wonderful because
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:54.960]   it's not digital there's always going to be like little pops and crackles and i had to what got me
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:01.920]   to pay 20 bucks for this was no i didn't. You paid 20 bucks for this? Yes i did because i kind of
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:07.680]   want to occasionally put drop the needle down and just listen to 20 minutes of clicks pops and just
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:15.280]   that's what i need to clear my mind also i just like the idea of this and most most of
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:22.240]   i almost never buy tangible objects on Kickstarter it's almost always uh someone who wants to do a
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.040]   comic book or wants to write a novel or someone wants to do like a series of art prints that this
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:33.600]   idea is so creative and interesting that i just want to give you money for being that weird and
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:40.000]   that committed to waving your freak flag as high and proud as possible. Under their Q&A the
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.400]   question is are you planning on any future release and their answers there have been rumors about
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:54.000]   live album i want to buy this just for the joke this is such a funny thing oh my god you guys are
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:01.200]   suckers is that a Kickstarter brain chance it is a it is a kickstarter oh what a surprise don't
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.360]   you feel like kickstarter is in you as seen on tv they're like no wait there's more there's a
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:12.240]   second side of silence oh my god what is on the other side by the way another 20 seconds of silence
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.760]   they also say that if you if you don't have 20 if you don't have 20 minutes to meditate just set
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:23.760]   it to 45 rpm and you'll get 15 minutes of silence for meditation actually the the second side b is just
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:33.120]   five john cage songs actually that's a that's a hovered joke actually actually actually they were
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.760]   in the q&a some parts of this sound like john cage is four minutes 33 seconds is that intentional
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:43.920]   no but what a compliment this composition was music and he wanted to include all sounds of that
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.840]   definition this is not music nor were any musicians involved in this recording
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:55.680]   you guys this joke is great ah should i get this as a gift for someone absolutely we've
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:02.720]   been sure you had you put windows 95 on your Mac for free you like that fine this is an interesting
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:08.640]   project from phyllis reesburg it's on github it you can download it and run it i never did get it
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.400]   running on the Mac but i do have it running on windows i i think it was just something maybe a
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:19.280]   bad download but it includes mind sweeper uh Netscape navigator and a whole lot more i mean
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:24.800]   this thing is awesome it is uh let me let me run it again i seem to oh no i was working here we go
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:32.160]   ah there's mind sweeper it's just as slow as the original windows 95 as well um i think there
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:38.560]   there's also uh some of your favorite games like doom wolfenstein 3d should i try
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:44.480]   do you think it had run wolfenstein let's try it do it oh man this would be fun if it really works
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:52.160]   it is free um i don't know how to tell you how to get it but uh um it's on github if you search for
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:58.480]   phyllis windows 95 there's a linux version there's a windows version and there's a mac version
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:07.360]   and uh battery's not included it's based on electron so it would have crashed yeah uh rene when
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.800]   when you crashed uh chrome it's pretty wild because it has doom wolfenstein a 10
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:18.480]   tank killer and grand pre-circuit along with mind sweeper you can reset the machine it supports
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:26.320]   high dpi devices there's downloads for mac windows and linux uh i guess you know github.com/phyllis
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:31.120]   r-i-e-s-e-b-e-r-g
