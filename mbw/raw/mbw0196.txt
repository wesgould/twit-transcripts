[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Cupertino and environs.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   On the show with us today, we've got a big cast starting with Andy
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   and Ico from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Hello, Mr. Mutton Chops.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   You're looking particularly clear today.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Do we have a chance?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes, because I've switched to the Logitech something, something,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and editing you'll actually dub over the actual model.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   [ Music ]
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yes, it says Carl Zeiss and it says TSR2.com.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Exactly.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   So, yes, very nice camera that I've had in the office for about a year now,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   but I'm only now getting around to using it as my regular.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I'm giving one of those extreme home makeover guys are going over.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I lied my butt off so that I have three kids were dying of different things.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So, they're coming in and giving my office a sort of a mess.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Can I say?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Makeover.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's a bad time.

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The first thing that it was put that piece of black cardboard in the back.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That's the portal where all the others went.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Ah.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I thought it might be the iPhone 4G behind there.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I just, well, no, no, certainly not.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Certainly not.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And if we wouldn't be able to say so there he is.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Merlin Mann looking a little scary right now.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Good morning, Merlin.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Hi, I'm getting a little bit of asthma over here.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I need to hear a kind of like that.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Look at that.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Oh, he was.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   He and Dr. Everett Koop were the kings of the mutton shop.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Huh.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And who was the president at Haddam?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Was it a MacArthur?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Chester B. Arthur, I believe, is to develop until the month.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Chester B. Arthur.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And then there's Chester.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You should have killed that butterfly six million years ago,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   but you warned to stay on the Mars pad.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Also here with his...
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Hey, look at that.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Mr. Scott born in the pink from Gig Haba.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Haven't seen you in ages, Scott.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   How have you been?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Well, I've been busy, busy, busy, but wonderful to be back.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And back here in Gig Harbor for the summer.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And glad to see that all my friends are well.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Keep getting these emails from people saying,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   "Did I miss the screw you moment between you and Leo?"
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   How come it's on the show?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I hate to just break the news to everybody, but not everything has to end badly.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Am I not?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Am I, am I like considered to be the guy who like pisses an alienates people and pisses them off?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   No, it's me that they think is that.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Oh, you said screw you to me.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I get it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Okay.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   They wanted to know.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   They're very nice, Leo.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You have a reputation.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I got a couple of things going on.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I may not be able to be here every week.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I love having you.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And the Tommy Bahama looking very nice today.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Tommy Bahama thing.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But no Tommy Bahama hat because I can't make my creative live headset work with my hat yet.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Looks good.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Looking fine.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I am proud of the fact that I still have hair at my age, Leo.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We also want to welcome Mr. Adam Anxt of tidbits, the original, the one and only, the best Macintosh newsletter.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I've been reading it for more than 10 years, isn't it?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Oh, God.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   20 years as of April.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   What?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Wow.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I mean, you don't look at all that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.400]   I'm going to tell you, look at this back in 1990.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.680]   We were young and stupid and had no clue that we were going to be doing it 20 years later.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   That's a cat.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   It really is amazing.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   I was reading you an OS 7 on a reader.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   You had a special reader.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.400]   It would turn the mail list into a head and app.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.560]   Do you remember this?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.360]   Easy view is written by a guy named a Keith Tyler who was a computer scientist.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.200]   He still is a computer science professor in Turkey.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   And through Turkish connections, that was how I learned that the president of Turkey
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.000]   at one point was a tidbits reader.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Wow.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That's so cool.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's really neat.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Turkish Delight.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Well, you can subscribe, T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.080]   It's absolutely free.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.560]   How many millions of readers you must have had over the years?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   We have a, we're not huge that way.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.360]   We're probably in the 50,000 or so.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.720]   But I mean, you niques over 20 years.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.600]   The thing is, is that those are for the most part people who have been with us for a long,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   long time.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.040]   I mean, the big spike in our subscriptions came in '94, '93, '94 when my internet starter
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.640]   kit for Macintosh books were really buried.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.600]   And but people got on the internet then and they subscribed to T-bits because the book
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.000]   gave them instructions on that and they've been with us ever since.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And which is kind of scary sometimes because I occasionally get mail from relatives saying,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.400]   "Could you please remove so-and-so because he died?"
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.520]   And he's like, "Oh, oh, he's been with us for 20 years.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.680]   That's kind of sad."
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.840]   Wow.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.960]   And you're doing now, you're doing the Take Control books which are PDFs.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.800]   Those are awesome books.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   Yeah, awesome books.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   The Back to My Mac book is the single best resource I've ever seen for unraveling how
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   to do anything with Back to My Mac.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   It's really good.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   We had God knows we need-
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   We had God knows we need-
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   As in on the Glen Fleischman who was a wonderful guy for anything networking and airport,
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.520]   Wi-Fi, all that stuff.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   Glen knows it cold.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.840]   There's no one coming out next week.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.120]   Take Control of iPad networking and security which Glen has done and tons and tons of iPad
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   networking details.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.680]   You don't even think about iPad as having details because Apple tries to hide them.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.040]   Glen's ferreted them out.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   Awesome.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.200]   Tidbits.com, you got to read it.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   20 years.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.080]   You pretty much invented blogging, I think, with that.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   Yeah, when the whole blogging thing came along, we're like, "Well, so what's the point?"
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   We've been doing that.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   We do that.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.880]   So, WWDC is coming up.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.600]   Is it next Tuesday?
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   Is it a week from Tuesday?
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   It's a week from Monday.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   A week from Monday.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   Monday.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.160]   And Steve Jobs has announced you won't be disappointed.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   Really?
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   Once.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.480]   I've always- Once again, an email from the Steve.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.040]   He's just been on fire lately.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.920]   Somebody wrote to him after Google I/O which was last week, and Google, by the way, especially
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:02.880]   on the Thursday speech, "Vikkun Dotra" really was just shooting from the hip at Apple
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.680]   at every moment.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.160]   And said, "What do you think after Google's announcements?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.440]   Is Apple- Can Apple keep up with iPhone 4?"
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   And Steve says, "You won't be disappointed, which could mean anything.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.200]   I don't know what it means."
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   What does it mean?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.440]   What does it mean, Adam angst?
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:28.560]   Now Steve is the most interesting CEO around because you have to figure that Apple PR cringes
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   every time he sends email, but at the same time, he's the only voice that will actually
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.320]   respond reliably with an Apple.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.120]   But you can always- But does you think he made it that way?
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.360]   I mean, isn't it his creation?
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.320]   Yeah, but he didn't used to do it that much.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.600]   I mean, the whole one-line email thing has really picked up over the last couple of years.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   A couple of years, a couple of months?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   Well, a couple of months, even more so.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.800]   But there's an old guy who lives fairly near me and Lansing, about 10-15 miles away, who
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.920]   sent email to Steve a couple of years ago and got response back.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.280]   And man, he's on fire now.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.840]   He sends Steve mail probably once a week.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.720]   And I don't think he's ever heard back again.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.960]   But- You know, you'll need to get one answer.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.120]   See, I get all these emails from people saying, "Steve answers his email, "How come you don't?"
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.640]   Steve doesn't answer all his email.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.800]   I'm just saying that, right?
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   We answer all our email.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.400]   If I can answer one-
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   I'd stop.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.200]   130,000, I'd be happy with that.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.920]   Yeah, one line, it gets published.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.160]   So one email to Steve asked him what he thought of Gizmodo saying Google had leapfrogged
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   Apple with Android 2.2, Steve's response, three words, not a chance.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   Should have really done it this way.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   Not a chance.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.120]   And don't want those after it.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.040]   If I could do it with my head, I would.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.000]   Another emailer via MacRumors asked if Google was showing up Apple with its developer conference.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.840]   And if Apple had big announcements for WWDC, four words this time, you won't be disappointed.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:06.720]   But if you cut all these together into a virtual YouTube press conference, wouldn't
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.840]   it seem like the most reporters talking to the Soviet premier about how well the 1980
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Olympic Games are going to go?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   Premier, is it going to be full of excitement?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   You open, comrade?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.440]   And we're going to have a opportunity over our technology.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   Absolutely.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   You know what?
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.920]   It almost feels like a Turing test.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.560]   Like, is it really Steve?
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   Is it a robot?
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   Because it could be.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   Steve or Eliza?
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.280]   You know, of course, the Joy Attack comic, NitroZak and Snaggy made this great Steve Jobs
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.720]   email responder, which basically had all of those.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   Yep.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   Nope.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   They're going to have to add a few.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.720]   You won't be disappointed.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.200]   You feel when you say, "When is printing coming to the iPad?"
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.800]   I feel good.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.680]   So what do you think you won't be disappointed means, Andy?
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.600]   Do you have any insight into what we'll see at WWDC?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.440]   I can tell you that I don't have any specific insight information on what's going on at
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   WWDC.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.840]   I did not even know that for a fact there was going to be a Steve Jobs keynote on Monday.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.960]   I had to do one of those leap of faith bookings of airfare to get over to WWDC.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.040]   I do think that as soon as we weren't 10 minutes into that Google I/O keynote on day
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.520]   two, the first one was a real chance of--
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.520]   First one was a dud.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.520]   First one was a dud, the second one.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.200]   Oh, it was also Google saying, "Well, in the future, nobody will be using local apps.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.800]   We're all going to be using cloud-based apps because there's so much better than anything
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   else."
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   Very nice, very nice.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.160]   But yeah, we weren't 10 minutes into the day two conference when you know that a lot
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.840]   of whiteboards at Cupertino were at least partially or completely erasing, "Okay, where's what
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.480]   the keynote now has to be about at WWDC?"
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.400]   It really has to be about not directly responding to the points that they were making, but
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.880]   at least to make sure that there is at least a nod towards it.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.760]   And then anybody who is examining this keynote to get the answer that everything that Google
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.680]   said was rubbish is going to find those answers in that keynote.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.320]   That'll be a direct response, you think.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.960]   Well, the thing is, is this the key job really far from those keynotes for a long time.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.160]   But at the same time, there's always a spot at the start, which is more or less open for
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.960]   ad hoc comments that need to be relevant.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.840]   But most of that stuff, he's been just going over and over and over again for probably,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.600]   you know, two weeks or a month already.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.280]   I was told that a lot of changes in the last minute.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.200]   I was told that the way it works is all the product managers are supposed to come up with,
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.360]   "This is what we want you to do at the keynote."
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.080]   And they line up and Steve sits down and says, "Yes, no, yes, no, yes, yes, no."
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.560]   And if you've got to have a complete demo and he figures out which ones now, presumably
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.760]   that's already happened.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.360]   Or you think Andy, it hasn't, that they're doing that now?
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.880]   No, I think I definitely think it's happened.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.320]   But I do know that the roadmap for the keynote is a little bit, is certainly fluid enough
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.640]   that if a week beforehand they decide that they need to make a substitution or change
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.760]   the tone of the intro or make sure that a certain point that it needs to be made, they're
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   going to make it.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.960]   You know, Steve says that even if it's 12 hours before the keynote, people jump.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.200]   I mean, that's absolutely true.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.800]   I mean, I have heard rumors about the changes, major changes happening as close as 48 hours
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   before the end.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.120]   We have seen, I mean, we have seen it, maybe it's us looking too hard, but it really, I've
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.800]   seen several keynotes where it looked like there was clearly a chunk here that was taken
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.480]   out or there was a chunk here that was put in.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.080]   It's just clear that the flow, okay, move on.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.040]   So I would guess that they have a pretty solid roadmap at this point, but anything could
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   change, of course.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   Right.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.640]   But I also think they're not going to make the mistake that Google made.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.280]   Google made a real, that was a real punk ass move that diminishes their strength and
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.560]   their influence, or at least their own public perception of it because I'm sorry, the move
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.080]   of just hammering at Apple so relentlessly.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.680]   The way that you do this is that you do it carefully.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.520]   You make sure that you inside that conference room on the whiteboard, you have that list
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.000]   of ways in which Google wants to say that Apple's phone sucks, and you could make sure
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.200]   you get through that bold list one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.040]   ten, and you make sure that you do not ever directly say Apple's phone sucks.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.800]   You want to make sure that those 5,000 people in the room and countless hundreds of thousands
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.140]   of people who are watching that by streaming will get that on their own.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.120]   When you make that argument and push that button so relentlessly though, you're sending
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.080]   the message that we agree that no one thinks that we're as good as Apple.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   It's a sign of it.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   That's where we're going.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   We're going to tell it.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   It's a sign of weakness.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   And I think so.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   You have a great phone.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.440]   If you're going to give your competitor that much airtime, it's always a dicey deal.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:38.000]   I remember back in the day when Mamiya ran an ad against Hasselblad.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.680]   It said Hasselblad hasn't changed in years or something like that.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.520]   The Hasselblad execs were so excited to be mentioned so prominently in the ad that they
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.240]   actually called the magazines and said if Mamiya stops running that ad, we'll pay to
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   rerun.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   We'd like to keep running.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.320]   Well, now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they actually said the word Apple
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320]   very often.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.800]   It was mostly people watching going, "Well, that's that's the game."
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.280]   Well, every time they wanted to talk about the performance, they're like, "And now here's
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.960]   that they ran like the the the the the the browser browser war was against the the browser
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.160]   in 2.1 and also an iPad that was that was running it.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.400]   They're also talking about really cool features like being able to share your your your 3G
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.040]   internet connection and say, "Oh, come on.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040]   Come on.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.880]   How come you can't tell there like that?"
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.840]   And it's and then say, "You and you have to agree because I know you have 2.2 on your
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   Nexus one.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   I I mean, it's free."
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.920]   Yes, it's see and it's painful because I haven't unlocked Nexus Nexus one.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   And so I just I took the SIM card out of this and I put the SIM card into this.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.760]   And then like about five minutes later, I was getting like Wi-Fi internet sharing off
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.600]   of my I've had everything else.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.840]   It does it doesn't work quite as cleanly as an as a Wi-Fi, but I just had to say that
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   really stings.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   That's bad.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.960]   I think you know, I think that last week and I agree and I think part of this is that
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:06.520]   Vic is not as polished to presenter as as Steve Jobs and and Google is oddly enough,
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.000]   not as strategic and didn't think I think they didn't think ahead and say, "Oh, this
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   would look bad.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.800]   I think that they this was this was just them gone.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   See, we got you.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   We got you."
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.560]   But I do have to say at Google I/O, I felt like Android.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.240]   It came of age and it it really I have to say I'm now saying, you know what might be
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   a very strong contender for the iPad is a Android device with the same form factor.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.720]   That's that's one of the questions that I raised.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.360]   I did a 30 day follow up on my iPad review saying that the next the next real big test
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:44.880]   for the iPad is when these Tegra 2 processors running Android 2.2 tablets start coming out.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.000]   And finally only then will we get the answer to the question how much of the iPad success
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   we all like it.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.240]   How much of that is because it's simply a very fast, sprightly, multi touch based computer
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.600]   in a slim tablet form factor that runs forever on battery and how much of that is directly
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.800]   due to the fact that it's an Apple design product with all the stuff that they do with
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   the software and all the human interface.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.920]   So not until we get that first $499 32 gig tablet, we're going to find out that, well, actually
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.680]   no, any tablet of this form factor at that price for that runs a really good web browser
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.280]   is as at least 90% as good as an iPad.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.280]   The iPad.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   But they're going to be an Apple battle.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.480]   We'll hold on to Apple's sold already.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   Right.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.480]   Go ahead, Scott.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.960]   The Apple people are hoping that Google will decide to sell their iPad competitor direct
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.880]   just like they did their phone.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.680]   That was a question.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   Sure.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   Sure.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.440]   This a lot of this conversation is pops and buzzes from where I am.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.200]   But the question I have.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.320]   Do you mean technically from Skype or you haven't trouble with Skype or is it?
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.000]   No, no, no, I just don't follow this stuff.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.920]   The question is from a business standpoint, but you got to assume that, well, I'll tell
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.160]   you why I don't follow this stuff.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.760]   It's a soap opera from where I stand.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   Yeah, but that's the fun.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   There's a word choice.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.800]   I know, I'm just explaining to where my question is coming from.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   Like I don't care.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   I've got a phone.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   It's fine.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   I like it.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   I do stuff with it.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   That's what interests me.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:09.480]   But I'm just a criticism, but my question is like we read this as this epic mythical story
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.560]   between giants.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.720]   And so obviously it's a very interesting story, but we pose it that way.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.960]   My question is if we take it as red that Steve Jobs, again, Steve Jobs, we do this metonymy
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.120]   thing where we have one person represent the company, but Google's a smart company,
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   right?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   It's done a lot of good stuff.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.280]   From your point of view, this is not a cynical question.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.920]   When somebody gets up there and makes what sounds like such a, not even defensive, but
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.280]   just confident people don't talk like that.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   Confident people, if you know Taikwondo, you never have to show it unless you just beat
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.600]   somebody's ass in two seconds.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.960]   You know, if you're confident, you don't talk like that.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.080]   From a business standpoint and a strategy standpoint, what is the primary reason?
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.840]   Who are you persuading, you hope when you talk like that?
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.200]   Are you trying to talk people out of buying iPhones in the interim?
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.120]   Or like what is the doubt, the fud you're trying to create when you give a crazy talk?
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   Let's point out, and I think this is really important, that Google I/O is a developer
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   conference.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.800]   It is, even though Apple uses WWDC in willing two weeks as a public platform, Google historically
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   does not.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.760]   It's not a good thing to do this week, but I really think that the audience for this
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.600]   moment was developers.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.800]   You have to think, with 200,000 applications in the iPhone App Store, you really are talking
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.160]   developers and saying you want to develop for Android.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160]   That is a very big message.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   Huge.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Huge.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.720]   It sounds like a lot of these things, like WWDC, you think what Steve Jobs were implying right
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.200]   here, that whatever Steve Jobs or whoever says there is going to have a reach way beyond
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.160]   a bunch of guys in panic shirts.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.200]   It does, and I think Google will know this from now on.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.000]   It sounded a lot to me like Microsoft circa 2005.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.600]   It's funny because Groober pointed out what Groober said about this was it's now Apple
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.640]   and Google and Microsoft is out of the game.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:58.680]   It's the way they sound when they were stuck between fear of antitrust and pants-crapping
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.280]   terror over Google.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.440]   They were really had forgotten, like I said, numerous times.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.360]   They'd forgotten that they're the Empire.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.280]   They're the ones that they forgot how to win.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.240]   It's just interesting because obviously this is a huge company.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.320]   I'm asking an honest question though.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.200]   Do you really think that was just for developers or how would they know that a talk like that
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.320]   went well to use my parlance?
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.200]   They're talking people, they're creating fear uncertainty and doubt about Apple or they're
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.320]   trying to basically talk you out of investing or do you really think it was just for developers?
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.760]   No, I think it's partly for developers because they know that the weakness of Android right
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.200]   now is in the software library.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.400]   If you try to look for the same quality, breadth and caliber of applications that you find
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.880]   on the iPhone in the Android marketplace, it's just not there.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   Every time I find an app for Android that I really, really like, it turns out that it
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.040]   is just a port of an iPhone, an iPhone app.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.680]   But Google has a different business than Apple does.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.240]   Apple sells phones directly to people.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.240]   They sell through AT&T, but chiefly they want the point of contact to be the Apple store.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.480]   Google's strength is the fact that all they have to do is get every single one of these
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.200]   characters to start getting Android devices and sell them that way.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.880]   They don't care about selling directly.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.600]   They don't care about the hearts and minds arguments.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   They care about all the clicks and all the data and all the other personal information
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.320]   that they're going to get just by simple fact that they're going to be controlling a point
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.360]   to point from the person standing in the street to the store that gets that click to the transaction
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.120]   that's made inside the store that they'll get all that information.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.920]   The leading information and money.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.120]   You say they're bleeding both information and money when Apple wins.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.880]   And also, I mean, they've got a hell of a great new operating system.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.840]   It's about time that they start, they need to start positioning the Android not as the
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.320]   alternative phone, but as a consumer device, just like the iPhone is a consumer device.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.840]   They're not quite there yet, but maybe by 2.4 they'll definitely have a very good consumer
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   grade phone.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.400]   I'll be honest, I think Apple really doesn't need to care about, I mean, Google doesn't
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.040]   need to care whether Apple wins.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.880]   Google said many times and I believe it's true that all they want is for you to use the
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.080]   Internet more.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.640]   They make money when you use the Internet.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.040]   They make money off the iPad.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.360]   They make money off the iPhone.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:06.440]   However, I think what happened is that you, what you're hearing there is the enthusiasm
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.280]   internally at Google for open versus closed.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.840]   And I think that this is the religious war.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   That's marketing.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   You think that's marketing?
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:22.040]   That's marketing because I hate to quote myself here, but last week I was thinking,
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.640]   I mean, it's easier to do it than I thought of the show.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.880]   No, in last week's column I was talking about the keynote and saying that, okay, that's
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.520]   a valid point that Apple is not behind a completely open experience.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:42.040]   I think the really great takeaway line from the Google keynote was that we don't care.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.880]   We think we have the fastest browser, but what we really want is to have the most inclusive
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   browser.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.160]   But what you can do if you really wanted to take that same sort of mechanism, take the
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.600]   exact, take all the data that you got out of the Google keynote and run it through the
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.280]   exact same machine that Google ran Apple's announcements and Apple's ideas from to get
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.640]   the exact same sort of results, which is Google wants you not to use applications that are
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.680]   native to your device because if it doesn't go through the Internet, they can't track
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.680]   it.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.760]   They don't want you, they want you, they help on us Google TV.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.880]   They want you to make sure that you watch your TV through one of their operating systems
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.320]   and devices because if you don't, they can't figure out what you watch when you watch it,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.440]   when you pause, when you fast forward it, what commercials you went to, what you wanted
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.000]   to look up on the Internet after you watched it, point after point after point after point.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.200]   If you want to interpret Apple's motives as we don't want open systems, we want to control
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.920]   the user experience, you can do that.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.200]   If you also want to interpret Google's keynote as we hate it when we use this do something
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.680]   that we cannot observe and monetize, you can interpret it that way.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.760]   That's why I see this as marketing, marketing, marketing instead of a feature feature feature.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.240]   Adam, you were going to say something.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.720]   I was going to say, I'm not sure I disagree with you on the feature feature feature Andy,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:58.480]   but I do think that one of the only real chinks in the iPhone ecosystem is the App Store approval
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.120]   policies and that's one place where Google's openness will take anything is really helping
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.120]   them.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:12.320]   Not that it's likely to attract all developers away from the iPhone, but if they can present
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.600]   an alternative platform where developers don't have to put up with a BS that they go through
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.960]   with Apple sometimes, then that's a place where they can compete where they're having
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.480]   more trouble competing on the technical aspects and because these phones really do more or
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.680]   less the same things.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.800]   For normal users, it's 6.0, 1/2 dozen of another.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.960]   What they really need to do is go for the developers such that at some point someone
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.520]   will come up with that killer app that is not the same on the iPhone.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.680]   Apple has the better counter argument, which is that we don't care about what our users
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.920]   do.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.480]   Our job is not to trick you the developer into making our phones more useful.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.760]   Our job is to help you to make some money here.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.280]   That's the argument that Apple consistently makes that you can put things under the Android
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.760]   marketplace and they'll be somewhat successful, but the next Beatles, the next Rolling Stones
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.360]   of developers will not come through the Android story, will definitely come through the iTunes
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   store.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.920]   That's the point that they really want to control.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.200]   True, all those developers aren't making squats.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.520]   TechCrunch article that showed the actual numbers, it's clear that it's not a business
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.160]   for the vast majority of the developers.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.640]   I want to talk a little bit, hold that thought if you don't mind, Scott and Merlin.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.160]   I want to talk a little bit about Google going after Apple's hobby.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.520]   Maybe it's not such a hobby anymore in just a second I do, but we have a brand new sponsor.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:42.640]   I want to welcome to the show and I'm actually very glad to welcome to the show because for
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:52.440]   a long time, many of our competitors have done ads for a domain registrar that I'm not
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   fond of.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.840]   How can I phrase this without giving them a free plug?
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.560]   You know who I'm talking about.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:04.680]   I have to say, for a long time, I've known the guys at Took House and think the world
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   of them.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.000]   They are a great registrar.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.920]   We have moved all of our domains.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.160]   We're in the process of moving all our domains to their new hover.com.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.720]   I want to encourage all of our listeners to take a look at hover.com.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:27.160]   Hover is a domain name registration system, but it also has very great management tools.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.560]   You'll get 10% off your new domain right now.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:39.280]   If you go to twit.hover, H-O-V-E-R dot com, just the cleanliness, the simplicity of this
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   site compared to...
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   The cleanliness.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.120]   Well, yeah, go to the other sites and I'm not just saying one, but they're all starting
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.680]   to look like this.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.120]   You register domain and there's 12 pages of things you want to say, "I don't want that.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.960]   No, I don't want that.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   No, I don't want that."
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.560]   It takes 50 clicks to buy a domain these days.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   It does.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560]   Go to Hover.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.280]   I just bought oldguysnostuff.com, by the way.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   This is my...
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   Do me a favor.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.640]   Do me a favor, Scott.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.960]   The next domain, just try twit.hover.com.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   I'm there right now.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   I'm buying something.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.120]   I'm picking up a good name.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.240]   It's so simple, so clean.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.880]   You may remember them as domains direct.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.720]   They've been doing this since 1997.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.960]   They are, of course, an ICANN registered registrar.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.720]   Domain forwarding, $15 starts at $15.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.480]   You want to add an email box, $35, $60.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.960]   That's a year, and you get 10% off.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.120]   Do they have pictures of good looking female race drivers?
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   No.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.960]   If you're looking for that, you're going to have to go somewhere else.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.880]   This is long as I didn't have the belly fat ads.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.120]   No belly fat ads.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.880]   I'm telling you, this is finally, okay?
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.640]   I want you to go to twit.hover.com.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.840]   They have a new no hold policy for customer service calls Monday through Friday 9 to 8
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.840]   PM Eastern.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.240]   You're going to get somebody right away.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   That's ambitious.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.120]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   I have to say, there's one of the registrars that I've gone through a number.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.920]   The one that I used for the big domain, for twit.tv, and we're moving everything over
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.480]   to Hover Now, has a really nasty thing that they do.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:19.360]   They basically make your password stop working after five weeks or months or something.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.560]   Every time I log in, my password, they say, "Oh, your account's been locked," so that you
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.480]   have to call a sales rep.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   That sucks.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.520]   It's like that was it.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.520]   That was the last straw.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.280]   This does look like a very nice clean site, you know?
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   Twit.hover.com.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.040]   I'm really thrilled to get them on.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.080]   We've been saying- Now, do I get to discount if I log into that site or do I have to type
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.800]   in something extra?
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   You know, that's a good question.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.440]   Yeah, you use the code TWIT.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   Okay.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   Check out.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   So you don't have to go to twit.hover.com.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.080]   You just go to hover.com if you want.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   Use the code TWIT.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.360]   They do domain name registration, but they also have domain forwarding and a lot of other
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.600]   nice features.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   I always tell people, this is an example of what I'm talking about when I say control
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.000]   your name on the internet.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.800]   Get your domain and own it, and you don't have to host a site or anything.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.280]   Just get your name.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.000]   You've got scottborn.com.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.400]   I don't have leoletport.com, but I've got for my kids, I've got Abiloport and Henryletport.com.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.760]   And then you control it.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   That's what people are going to find.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.760]   That's what you need to do.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   Somebody else have leoletport.com?
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   I waited two hours.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   Some of the bastards.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   That's all right.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.080]   I got leoville, and that's what I've used since 1985, something like that.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.440]   I'm not going to go on and on.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   twit.hover.com.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.400]   Save 10% registered your domain name.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.160]   I have a quick question and comment though.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   Doesn't everybody agree?
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.400]   This is what I think happens.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.320]   When I go to the place with the race car girl and try to register as domain, I swear
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.400]   to God, there's some little gremlin that as soon as I search for that name goes, oh, that
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.960]   name's available, but it's $2,000.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.760]   No, that's known.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.760]   Yeah, that's known.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.480]   As soon as you look for a name, they will basically reserve it.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.240]   So don't go looking for names at these other guys because they will reserve that name and
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.720]   you won't be able to get it.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.840]   If you're going to use the other guys, register that name, do not go look for it.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.280]   This is known, not at Huffle's com.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.280]   It happened to me.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   I swear the other guys.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.520]   It drives me crazy.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.280]   I was like, I checked who is and there was nothing there.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.680]   So then I went over to the race car place and checked it and all of a sudden it was $2,000.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680]   Yep.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.640]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.760]   This is a scam or a Roni if I've ever seen more.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.960]   I don't know how that happens, but I'm just saying it won't happen at Huffle.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.160]   Twit.hover.hovr.com.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.440]   We're really glad to welcome them to the show.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.000]   I've been looking for somebody that I could feel comfortable doing ads for.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   We've actually turned down the other guys.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.720]   Cleanliness is next to godliness.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.320]   A number of times.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.640]   I don't take ads from people I don't trust in use.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.360]   So here's an interesting counter to the argument that we've been having.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.920]   I agree with you, Andy.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.280]   It looked like Google was oversensitive and that was a sign of weakness.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:04.240]   Now Steve Jobs is responding to Google's VP8 codec web M saying, no, that's no good.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.440]   It's going to be encumbered.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.360]   We're sticking with H.264.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.440]   You don't think that's the same kind of over sensitivity?
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   Not really.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.240]   I mean, the VP8 was just not a very useful codec for anything that Apple's doing.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.080]   The big advantage to it is simply that Google has supposed claims that they've bought all
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.480]   the patents and that they can release it license free.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.880]   So if I wanted to do my own video streaming app and I did not want to work, not only
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:33.200]   pay the license fees for 264, but also hopefully not worry that I'm going to get sued three
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.440]   years from now from a patent shark, that would be an interesting technology for me to adopt.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.720]   There's already questions though as to whether or not Google actually owns all that stuff
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.320]   free and clear when they bought the company that put together that codec.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   I mean, it's okay for web stream.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.400]   That's about it.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:54.940]   Those questions were raised by MPEG-LA and Apple, not by anybody else.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.640]   That seems to me a very clear example of FUD.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.760]   MPEG-LA says, "Woo, those may be encumbered."
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.960]   I think Google was very clear.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.000]   We did the due diligence.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.160]   We do not believe that VP8 is encumbered.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.920]   We believe that we can make this royalty free arrangement for all of you.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.240]   They did this because Mozilla was not going to pick H.264 for HTML5 and it doesn't support
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240]   it.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.600]   I think that this is FUD coming from El Pagle-LA saying, "Well, it might be encumbered."
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.640]   I think it's, "Well, if you read the license though, what's the license?
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   You've read the license Scott?
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   Of course you have.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   I've read the license.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   I'm the guy that reads all these licenses.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   Of course you have.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.720]   If you sell 200 videos, here's what you owe.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   Are you ready?
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   Two bucks.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   For MPEG-LA.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   Right now.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   Yeah, but I can't.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   The point is they own it.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.120]   It's two bucks now.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.400]   It's not two bucks 10 years from now.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   They could pull it later on.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   At any time.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.560]   If they want to get a new standard going, they want to get it for a gift.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   No.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.400]   You can't and that's why Ping came along.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.560]   This is the whole point.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.520]   Nobody wants to, well not nobody.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.920]   Mozilla does not want to.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.440]   Look, Microsoft can afford the $15 million license fee.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   Apple can afford a $15 million license fee.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   By the way, that's what they pay.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.680]   I believe that's the amount they pay for the H.264 license.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.440]   If you buy a video camera, it says in the license, you may not use this for commercial
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:17.840]   purposes because MPEG-LA says you have, yes, MPEG-LA says you have to license it for commercial
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   use.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   Wow.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.000]   So the point is not that it's only two bucks right now, Scott.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.360]   It is encumbered.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.040]   It's owned by somebody and there's no guarantee that it's going to stay that way.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.480]   What we need is an unencumbered codec.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.640]   Now, I'm not as, I'm sorry.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   I'm just, I'm not as worried about stuff like this.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   It's cheap now.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.880]   They've made it clear if you look at the discussions from lawyers on this, the intent of these
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.320]   folks wasn't to go after me and you for selling 200 videos, Leo.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:50.760]   And I just think it's, I think the fun is is that this open source religion that everybody's
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.840]   got is, I just don't believe it.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.840]   That's not fair.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.840]   That's like, no, no.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   That's a different issue.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.160]   It would be like saying, I'm going to donate this book to the library and then the fifth
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.440]   person that takes it out the size that from now on, they get to charge when people take
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   it out.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   It has to stay free.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.520]   What you're saying, you're saying what it could happen, Merlin.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   I understand that.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.640]   No, I'm describing to you because I think you misunderstand what open source means.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.440]   I understand you don't like it, but you're not, but you're not particularly fairly
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   bad.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   It's not that I don't like it.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.920]   It's just that I don't see that there needs to be a religion about it.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.360]   I mean, it's not a religion, Scott.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   It's a problem.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.160]   The problem is that open source, depending on what flavor of this you're doing, the
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.680]   commonality that all of them has is we don't introduce anything to this that will keep anybody
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.000]   in the future from keeping it free.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.880]   And I don't, it doesn't matter whether you agree or not.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.200]   I mean, it's just not fair to say that they're, they're blocking because of, you know, they're
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   blocking because, well, you know, in the past, that's been the third rail.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.400]   And if you discover something and that cascades down to everybody who's relied on that being
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   free, especially if it's-
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.600]   Well, I get your point and I mean, maybe I misspoke, but the, the, my concern is is
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:57.000]   that, you know, we, at least in America, we believe in free markets and I do think free
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.800]   markets can control this.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   I really do.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   I mean, they can control-
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.120]   I mean, that's like saying you can use apples to start a car.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.800]   I mean, it's an interesting idea, but it's not the truth.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.000]   The truth that, yeah, capital, they're completely different things.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.480]   People use open-store source software inside of commercial stuff all the time.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.120]   You just have to do it in a way that honors the license.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   The same way that you-
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.560]   Always 10 is a good example of that.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.280]   Scott, I mean, Scott, I mean, you seem like somebody who strikes me as, as you like
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.240]   A, having control over what is yours and B, that if somebody, if you, if you decided
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.520]   that somebody can use it, like me, you want people to honor what you said is okay to do
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   with it.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.520]   And I think that's, that's the issue.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.080]   I don't want to go down a rat hole on open source or free software or whatever, but that's,
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.840]   that's the thing because I mean, that, that poisons the well for everything that happens
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.840]   down the road.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.840]   Look at Lynxis.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.000]   I mean, Lynxis really took it up the behind because of not acknowledging that there was,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.480]   I think it was, what's the one, what's the Stalin one?
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.480]   What's that license called?
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   Free software foundation that you can do.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.480]   What's the one?
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   What's the, what's the new?
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.480]   Yeah, good news.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   Good news are pretty tough license.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.240]   I mean, you, you notice when you, when you use anything that uses, I'm going to talk
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.720]   out of my butt a little bit.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.520]   You know, FFmpeg, fantastic, crazy, complicated thing that you can use for doing pretty much
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.680]   anything to video.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.920]   You'll notice that when you install most OS 10 apps, they'll say, okay, do you want to
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.160]   install the rest of the components that you need for this?
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.800]   Because they can't touch each other is my understanding.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:21.200]   So, so like, Gino in particular says if anything touches this in a certain way, it, it's, you
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.120]   agreed when you put this together to that license.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.560]   And as somebody who reads licenses, you would understand that Scott.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.040]   So, so it's just a matter of, I think, I think maybe I, maybe I said something you don't
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.400]   understand or I said it wrong.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.360]   And if I did, I apologize, no, when I, when I'm trying to get at is, I don't think that
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.840]   it's a bad business model to not have something be open source.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.040]   I, that's all I'm saying.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.160]   No, no, it's a good business model for the people on the license.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.760]   Nobody doubts that Scott.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.000]   My fear is, and, and my point is, is that if you, if you like a product that's not open
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.240]   source better than one that's is, and you're willing to pay the penny.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   You're right.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   And you should use it.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.280]   And if the marketplace, if the marketplace decides it likes H.264 better, even if there's
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.160]   a free open source product out there, then H.264 will win.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.440]   Here's the issue for me, Scott.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.000]   I'll be, I'll give you the, because I do have a dog in this hunt.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.760]   We stream a lot of video.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.920]   It's currently encoded H.264.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.480]   Our partners pay those license fees.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.120]   I don't have to pay any license fees.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.840]   If those license fees went up steeply, I could be out of business.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   Now, you're, you're saying there's no reason for MPEG-LA to do that.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.360]   And you're probably right because they, they prefer to collect a penny from me, the, you
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.000]   know, forever than a dollar once.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.560]   And the way free markets work is that where they to dramatically raise the price, this
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.120]   would cause other developers to come in and offer alternative.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   That's what's happening.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.640]   Well, and if that's the case, then I'm going to see how it all plays out.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.840]   That's exactly what's happening.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.920]   Google is saying, and this is, this is by the way, and Cara Schwisher in the, in all things
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.600]   digital, kind of called him out on this.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.000]   But one of the things Vic said, which was the most dramatic part of the Google I/O speech
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.840]   is if Google did not act, we faced a draconian future in which one man, one company, one
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.000]   device, one carrier would be our only choice.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.280]   We don't want a future like that.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.080]   Now that's, it's them that's ruling.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.560]   Well, and it might be my privilege.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.600]   And it might be that that's what they're saying.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.640]   However, I think that that's the market coming out now with saying Google's saying, no, we
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.240]   don't like the idea that, uh, and peg LA is has like, it's the same thing happened.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.440]   Remember Scott with the, the GIF format and you remember, I remember very much because,
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.160]   you know, we were all using GIF.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.680]   We were all using GIFs and there was this threat.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.040]   We're going to pull just from comp you serve and yada, yada.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.380]   And, and then what ended up happening was the JPEG standards group ramped up what they
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.560]   were doing and ping and ping and a bunch of our.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   So I'm, I'm happy for the open source solutions.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.800]   I use some of them, but I don't think that making for the
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.560]   every day, I mean, I don't know what your Mac is.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.560]   I understand that.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.740]   And I couldn't run if it didn't have the SD right, but my, but my point is Merlin making
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.560]   something evil because it's not open source is an oversimplification.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.520]   I don't think I don't think I don't think we're saying that nobody's saying that.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.800]   I'm not saying Merlin said that I'm just saying in general, people may say that in general,
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.960]   I see these arguments about the open source.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.880]   Ed Bon has a really good article, which I did not put in the rundown, but somebody in
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.520]   the chatroom just put in our show notes from ZD net, H.264 patents.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.160]   How much do they really cost?
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:36.720]   He says that there is a cap in place that guarantees rates won't go up more than 10%
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.080]   in the future.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.440]   And this all expires in 2020.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.080]   So maybe you're right, Scott, that there isn't, that it is a, that it is a moot point
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   that there isn't going to be.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.880]   I guarantee you it's a moot point.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.920]   It's just, it's made, it's made, it's become a political tool that people who have other
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.120]   agendas can use to advance those agenda costs.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.640]   And the cost, by the way, not 15 million, but 5 million for Microsoft and Apple and other
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.360]   enterprises, that's the maximum annual royalty.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:09.120]   More, more, more concerning to me are the taxes that, that national governments put on these
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:15.360]   things, which is why you have these ridiculous time limits in the video camera recording,
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.400]   because you have to pay a certain tax in Europe if you go over six minutes.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.600]   These are the things where you want to talk about losing control.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:28.360]   You want to talk about losing control when the guys with guns put the rules out there.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.840]   That's a little bit different.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.960]   Let me, let's change subjects and talk about Apple TV.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.120]   I'm sorry, Google TV.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.400]   I mean, I mean, I don't think Apple TV can be mentioned in the same sentence as Google
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.200]   TV because Google TV is actually an interesting, useful product.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.680]   Apple TV, Steve Jobs has always said is a hobby, but I bet you every one of us has an Apple
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.480]   TV and frankly, everybody has.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   You got rid of it.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.960]   You used to like that, didn't you?
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.960]   I love it.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   Yeah, I liked it.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.240]   I liked it until, I mean, yeah, I mean, I liked it.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.360]   I liked it like if I had gotten the child's toolbox with a plastic screwdriver, I think
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.000]   it was pretty cool, but then if somebody handed me an actual, like an entire set of screwdrivers
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   that actually did things.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.520]   What do you use now?
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   Mac Mini.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.320]   Yeah, so you made your own home theater PC, basically.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.840]   And you run, what do you run?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.840]   XBMC, Plex, what do you run on top of that?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.040]   I have a Mac Mini.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:24.480]   We have an Apple TV, but we actually leave it unplugged because we don't use it.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.960]   So we just, we just watch everything on a MacBook Pro.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   You're right.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   Exactly.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   No, it's not enough said.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   It's not me.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   It's awesome.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   It was plugged into my, it was plugged into my home theater system for like a long, long
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.440]   time, I think, and without really being used after applying OS updates, I unplugged it
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.240]   so I could take it along with me to give a talk and use it as a prop.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.360]   And I just never bothered to plug it back in.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   You know what it was for me?
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.320]   99 dollar Roku box does so much more.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.840]   I use it as so much more relevant to how I watch television and how I do video and even
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.800]   audio than the Apple TV.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   This is the, I totally agree with you.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.640]   I don't know that box in particular, but I'll tell you this.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.880]   We say, you want, didn't we send you one?
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880]   Me?
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   A Roku box?
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   No, no, I'll take it.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   Oh, we said everybody else one will send you one.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   Okay.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   I, um, no, but the thing was, here's, here's, this is a, I think.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   Cause we're on Roku.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   Just so you know.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.000]   I think this is an instance of one of the things Apple's usually a lot, lot, lot better
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.280]   at and I couldn't begin to explain why this is, but you know, Apple wants to be the one
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.560]   that you use last, right?
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.120]   Apple wants you to go out and go, gosh, a phone will never be good.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.920]   Whoa, I really like this iPhone.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.080]   They want you to go out and go, God, this creative jukebox was 40 pounds.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.080]   Whoa.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   My iPod's cool.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.720]   I want you to go, hmm, this Apple TV stuff introduces me to stuff that would be really
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.200]   neat if it worked.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.080]   And even, so basically I, super quickly, the stock, you know, basically Apple TV in my
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.520]   opinion is a device for buying things on iTunes.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.600]   That's what they should just call it.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.960]   I mean, the thing is I ran ATV, the ATV stick to basically get lots of cool stuff on there.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.920]   And at one point I was using, I forget what chap it was, but there's an app I was using
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.820]   that, um, was the first app I had used where you could throw any kind of media, well,
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:11.360]   VP4s, after you'd spent hours encoding them on your Mac, uh, only MP4s, I believe, for
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.980]   movies and it would pull down all the metadata.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.380]   It was super cool, but that broke in one release.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.380]   And you know what I did?
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:21.300]   I discovered at that point, I discovered XBMC and then I discovered Boxy.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:26.940]   Boxy, I still love, but it runs super hot on my machine, which is a crappy Mac mini.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.100]   And so I discovered things like, I think it's called VLC.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.100]   Yeah, VLC.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.500]   I've been using movement.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   Is it?
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.500]   Movedist.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.220]   VLC was crashing our MacBook Pro hard for a while.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.220]   Really?
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.220]   So, uh, we just switched to Movedist.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.700]   I'm still discovering what VLC does.
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.700]   I had no idea.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.700]   You can watch YouTube videos on VLC.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.980]   I mean, if you go to the VLC wiki, it's crazy what you can do.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.700]   You can watch anything with VLC.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.900]   You can actually watch us with VLC.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.100]   You can do it, but no, this is, this is, this is, well, I'm sorry to, to the DRAM.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.100]   MOV IST.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.660]   I just want to, I'm curious now.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.900]   But this is one good example of where open source is clearly the winner because people
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.020]   are contributing stuff to this modules, to this, the de-muxing stuff for this that just
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.620]   takes it to another level to where you can point something at a stream and it'll turn
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.540]   it into like the TS folders of it.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.780]   I mean, you could, if you go through that wizard, a lot of people just use it like they
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.780]   use iTunes.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:21.140]   If you go to that wizard and if you go in and look at the advanced options in VLC, it'll
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.580]   curl your hair, man.
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.580]   It's crazy.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.340]   We use it to convert video formats.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.340]   Right.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.780]   I still miss, I wish I squint or similar would be updated, but I love not having, I love
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.180]   and I haven't to convert movies.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.180]   It was crazy.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.500]   You should, you should look at this movie because it's based on quick time and FFmpeg.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.940]   It's on code.google.com/p/movies.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:42.940]   This is interesting Adam.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.380]   I hadn't, I wasn't, I should be reading tidbits more assiduously, obviously.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:50.180]   Very interesting and it's, it's free.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.180]   It's open source.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.180]   It's GPL.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.180]   Very nice little app.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.180]   Is it a player?
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.780]   It's mostly a player.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:04.660]   And basically, you know, as if we are not the TV involved people and so we watch pretty
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.980]   much everything ripped from DVD.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   And you know, all these other things have interfaces.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.740]   Fact of the matter is I'm a Mac guy.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.980]   I want to double click a file in the Finder and look file.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   It opens the movies.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.060]   And it might say like this guy, Leo.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.060]   I like this guy.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.900]   When I'm done and I want to hit command delete and have it go away.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.900]   Mr. double hit.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.900]   This is what a Mac guy could do by learning just a little bit more.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.500]   You still do, you still do a lot of clicking, but you know it's really amazing.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.260]   If you set up the right stuff, you don't even have to click.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.500]   No, it just plays.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.500]   It knows what you want and it just plays it.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.100]   I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm just saying it's like there's solutions
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   out there.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.260]   And when I talk to my clients about how the toothpaste is out of the tube.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.740]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:49.740]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.620]   I mean, that's, I'm not, now I'm not talking about Torrance.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.100]   You're not talking about Torrance, but something similar.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.100]   I wouldn't know.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.100]   I know it's at Merle's.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.100]   I have a Mac.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.100]   Any and I love my family.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.340]   Merle's desktop is completely blank and yet he still manages to make things happen.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.460]   I know it's amazing.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.460]   He doesn't double click.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.460]   He just I bought it.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.460]   I do.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.460]   It's true.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.460]   I don't have to click.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   It's all command line foo for who.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.260]   Accent now.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.340]   So you think so.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.540]   We didn't really talk about Google TV.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:22.300]   Is this, you know, initially the way we first heard the leaks were it was Google search
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.300]   using a dish box.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.700]   Now we know it's going to be Sony TVs in the fall.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.500]   Logitech's going to make a box.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.300]   I mean, as usual, they're open source.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.340]   They're open sourcing all the additions they've done for Google TV back into the Android
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.340]   project.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.580]   So anybody can port this anything that they want.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.780]   It is going, it's essentially a sort of thing where you press a button and you can either
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.420]   do Google search based on all TV listings, everything that's on your DVR.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.740]   It will even extend to things that are on streaming sites so that if you do a search
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.100]   for house, it will show you the current episode that's airing right now.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.660]   Push this to watch it right now or the episode that's going to be airing on the USA Network
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.660]   on Friday.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.380]   Push this to set the DVR to record it.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:03.980]   Or here's an episode on Fox.com and here's an episode you can buy as a digital download.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.980]   Like a TV.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.980]   Like a TV.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   I just finds it for you.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.140]   Well, well, but it finds it anywhere, which is what's cool.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.140]   That's so cool.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.700]   You don't have to go like, oh, seven o'clock on Friday or whatever.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.700]   It'll find you.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.140]   But the example they use on stage was you type house and not only finds it on the cable,
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.780]   but it also finds it on Hulu.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.900]   And frankly, I don't see any reason why I couldn't also find it on BitTorrent at some
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.700]   point because it's extensive.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.900]   It's a committee of the art of being open when there's only one plugin.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.900]   Also it has a full Chrome browser.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.580]   So anything you want to do to search, you can do it.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.820]   It'll do picture and picture.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:35.980]   They're also releasing some hooks.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:42.420]   So the API is so that if like a MLB or the NFL dot com site wants to interact with your
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.900]   TV in a meaningful way, like not only show you here the net here, the Red Sox is next
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.220]   to 10 games, but oh, well, here's what times they're airing.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.900]   Click on these things to automatically set your DVR to program them.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.900]   They can do that.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.740]   Also you can have third party apps.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.420]   You can have the Netflix app running on it.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.060]   Also it runs every existing Android marketplace app.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.180]   So they just simply downloaded the issue of Pandora, which was amazing.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.260]   existing Pandora app.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.460]   So and it'll either be hardwired into your Blu-ray player, your TV set, or you can buy
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.220]   a set top box to get it going.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.620]   And it talks to your Android handset or if you had a tablet.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.340]   I mean, this is this is going to be a killer.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.940]   They already have you already have an Android app for it that will let you control it, you
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.060]   know, with any with any Android device.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.260]   Google told me that night that they're also going to be releasing an iPhone edition of
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.260]   that same app.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.340]   But again, all this is an API so that if you wanted to write your own iPad app for Google
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.500]   TV, you could certainly do it.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.540]   The only thing you really can't do.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   Go ahead.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.100]   Well, it takes four minutes to start up like my Android phone.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.300]   Hopefully, hopefully not.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.740]   It was actually very sprightly in the demo.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.340]   I haven't seen it actually in live deployment yet, but it's actually very sprightly.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:49.980]   I mean, I think that this is sort of though the quintessential really cool Google release
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.100]   like Google Wave where it's a great demo and it gets you all excited.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.100]   And wow, that's great.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.100]   It's all open so anybody can incorporate this really cool idea.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.660]   And then two years ago, two years later, when I write about it, I have to start off by reminding
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.060]   people what Google Air is before telling them that, oh, they've actually opened it wide.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.580]   It looks like the sort of thing where if it's one of those features that they don't even
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:15.260]   have to promote as being part of the Sony TV or part of the Toshiba whatever, it's just
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:20.340]   something that, oh, by the way, there's also Google TV wired in, then they can have some
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.340]   success with it.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.500]   But I'm not sure if they're going to succeed in getting millions of consumers to be excited
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.140]   about paying a little bit extra for it.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.140]   I tried to get pricing.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.300]   They haven't announced pricing either Sony or Logitech on how much these are going to
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.300]   be.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:36.220]   Google told me that they anticipate that's going to be a, this is something that's going
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.900]   to be wired into the premium devices in a product lineup.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.340]   So it's not as though the $120 Blu-ray player that you buy came art is going to have this
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:50.340]   but the $230 model might have it built in just like the $230 model has says Netflix.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.140]   As long as you don't have to wear goggles to use it.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.140]   Yeah, please.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.140]   I'm not wearing no goggles.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   You just keep on.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.140]   You just keep on goggles.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.460]   I only wear them because it makes me look awesome.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:06.060]   My reaction to this was it's just yet another and I was kind of underwhelmed but I'll
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.060]   wait and see and of course I'll be very interested to see what they do with it.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.740]   But you know, you could do some of the same things with Tivo right now, Boxy and the Boxy
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.740]   Box will be out soon.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:14.740]   People, it's not all of that.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.740]   That's why I watch your show.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   This thing.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.740]   Yeah, but the interface.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.740]   Sorry.
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:19.740]   Exactly.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:23.100]   Google TV doesn't cost you 12 bucks a month forever.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.580]   Well, we don't know that yet.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.580]   Yeah, we don't know that.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.780]   Well, no, well, the Google Google says that that's not a pay service.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.260]   Release this will be told me.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.980]   But, but the, but the thing is Google is probably not doing anything.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.740]   They're offering this code to companies who will then make something which may be paid
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.740]   service.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.740]   We don't know what Sony's going to do.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.740]   We don't know what Logitech's going to do.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.940]   Is Google the back end?
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.740]   It's well, no, all they all it is is software with all it is.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.500]   It's an Android inside the box.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.900]   Essentially, the box is just a Google compute, an Android based computer with an atom processor
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.380]   that has a small amount of flash storage built into it, has wifi built into it and has an
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.380]   ethernet.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.860]   So it's as far it's talking web.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.860]   Exactly.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.580]   As far as I understand the architecture, and again, I only had about 20 to 30 minute conversation
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.380]   with Google Thursday night, like the day after the keynote, as far as to understand, it is
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:13.780]   essentially just an invisible little computer that doesn't need to call into the mothership
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.900]   in order to set up an account or get you going.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.580]   It is an independent computer that simply works.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:23.700]   So I don't know if Sony would even have the ability to say to turn on your Google feature.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.740]   It only costs $30 for the additional dish package.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.340]   Although that is sort of interesting.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.020]   They have a very close relationship with the dish network.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.820]   But that's not a case of a value added service.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.820]   One of the other things, open things they did to sort of get Google TV pushed forward
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   was to create an open IP standard so that if a Google TV box wants to communicate with
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.580]   a DVR or any other piece of hardware, here is a protocol for doing that.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:53.740]   So if Motorola or anybody wanted to develop a cable box that could be controlled by the
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:58.540]   Google TV, by that I mean set a DVR recording, change channels, that sort of thing.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.900]   Supposedly they could just simply support this open standard because everything is being
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:02.900]   open source.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.100]   But let's tune back in a year from now to find out if anything, any part of this works.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.500]   I want to take a break.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.820]   I want to come back and talk about a number of other stories.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.220]   We'll do our lightning round where we give you a bunch of stories and ask the panel's
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.220]   reaction to it.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:20.100]   Andy Anaco is with us from the Chicago Sun Times from 43folders.com.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.340]   Merlin Mann from scottborn.com.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.340]   The great scottborn.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.260]   Back with us again in the pink.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.420]   Looking good.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:33.020]   And Adam Anks of the 20 year old tidbits, T-I-D-B-I-T-S dot com.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.020]   Wow.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.020]   Congratulations there.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.020]   Back when the Beatles were still together.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.020]   That's how old these were.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   You know what else is?
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.020]   You know what?
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.020]   I thought it was blonde.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.020]   Okay.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   You know what else?
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.020]   Oh, sorry.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   You know.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.020]   That's the eyesight.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.020]   You look blonde.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.020]   You look blonde.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.020]   You know what else is exactly 20 years old.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.020]   Your anniversary was last month.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.720]   This month is Windows 3.0.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.140]   So you're a little older than Windows 3.0.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.100]   And it's still 18% of the Windows market.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:01.260]   I remember talking to Steve Jobs and he said that's when Microsoft started to lap us.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.620]   We had a 10 year advance.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.500]   And you know, we came out in '84.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:13.300]   But by '94, we were in trouble because Windows 3.0 started to lap us.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.980]   So we'll see.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.980]   We'll see.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.980]   Maybe you'll start lapping.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.060]   Who could you lap?
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.580]   The main people who are older, actually the only people I know who are older than we are
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.100]   is the Irish immigrant news.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.340]   You're lapping the Irish immigrant news.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.340]   Congratulations.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.340]   They just keep going.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.460]   I mean, they keep putting out all that news from Ireland.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.260]   They're like nine months or a year older than us.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.540]   And you know, I mean, I don't wish them any ill, but gee, it'd be nice to stop being
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.860]   second oldest.
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   The second oldest net newsletter.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.860]   All right.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:46.860]   We're going to take a break.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.860]   Come back and talk more with our great panel.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.500]   But I want to tell you about Gazelle.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.500]   Don't sell it.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.500]   Gazelle it.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.500]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:58.380]   I'm going to tell you there's new hardware coming out all the time like a new iPhone.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:03.420]   I just want you, you may not, you know, you may be thinking, can I afford this new iPhone?
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.220]   And let me just tell you what happened last time.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.220]   The 3GS came out.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.580]   A lot of people said, I've got to have the 3GS.
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.540]   They put their old iPhone, the 3G on Gazelle.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.540]   They sent it to Gazelle.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.060]   Got their 200 bucks.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.180]   And it was a push.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.300]   They were able to upgrade for nothing.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.100]   We'll see what happens when the 3GS comes out.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.340]   If your gear is in good shape, you're going to get the best price at Gazelle.com.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:32.180]   Go right now to Gazelle.com and just type in an object, something you're ready to sell,
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.340]   something you don't need anymore, you know?
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.820]   Leo, I've got an iPhone vest.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.820]   I wonder if they will.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.140]   Your vest might be very valuable to them.
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.420]   They'll tell you the price.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:44.140]   You tell them the condition, what you've got, they'll tell you the price.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:50.540]   They send you the box, in most cases postage paid, and then you send it into them.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.540]   You actually should fill the box with a bunch of junk.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.540]   Most of us have a bunch of junk.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.100]   And once you get, Gazelle gets your gadget, you get paid.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.820]   If you don't like the price, they'll send it back to you at their cost.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.860]   And by the way, you could select the payment method you want, payment PayPal, check, or
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:10.300]   an Amazon or Walmart gift card, and you get a 5% bonus with the Amazon gift card.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.420]   Or and I really like this, you can donate the value of your gadget to charity.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.700]   In fact, Gazelle has great charity pages too.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.420]   If you've got an event coming up, don't have a bake sale.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.420]   Have a Gazelle sale.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:26.820]   Just ask the parents of the soccer team or the club members to go to Gazelle.com, your
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:32.980]   special page on there, and donate their old used gadgets to the group.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.260]   The prices are kind of interesting.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.060]   Kindles and nooks, about $100.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.460]   Great way to get a new iPad, right?
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.140]   iPhones, about $400.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.860]   In some cases, if they're in good shape.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.860]   MacBooks, $600.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:43.860]   Check out the rates yourself.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.860]   Quotes vary by model.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.780]   So make sure you put the right model in there.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.500]   And to get full value, you want to send in the battery and the power cord if you have
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   them.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.420]   You don't have much choice in the iPod and the iPhone.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:58.100]   And if you tell them the condition, they'll give you an accurate quote.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.100]   It's a great idea.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.100]   Isn't it a great idea?
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.100]   I love this site.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.860]   Go to Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:08.820]   By the way, if it is something that they cannot resell, if it's something that's so old,
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.780]   don't hesitate to even do that stuff in the box because they do responsible recycling.
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.620]   They use green recyclers.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.820]   They don't ship it to China where some poor kid has to put up with the environmental nightmare.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:25.620]   They have a no export policy, a no landfill policy.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:31.700]   Their recycling partners are recognized by the EPA, have a documented environmental management
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.060]   system or independently audited.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:39.500]   Right now they use Cloud Blue as their primary recycling partner.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.740]   Really, this is a great company.
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.700]   They've been around since 2006.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.020]   They have a gadget lab team that hand inspects every device.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.820]   By the way, if you're sending them a netbook or device with a hard drive, they wipe the
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:53.420]   personal data before it's reused, resold or recycled.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   This is a great...
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.420]   What are they reselling to?
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.980]   A lot of it they do on eBay.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.180]   They're an eBay, big power seller on eBay.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.060]   A lot of it is through eBay.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.380]   Other sources as well, and they recycle.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.460]   They're a really neat group.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.500]   You could do it yourself on eBay if you want to put up with a hassle.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.580]   But this isn't going to get you.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.820]   They're the same amount of money with a lot less hassle.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.060]   They're really a great group.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.460]   We've sold a lot of stuff through them now.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.500]   I can tell you, I've been very happy with the results.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.540]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.540]   Don't sell it.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.820]   Gazelle it.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.820]   Have fun too.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.500]   It's fun site to go and put in stuff and see how much it's worth.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.580]   They can send a freight truck to my office.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.340]   You're a perfect Gazelle customer, Scottborn.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.940]   I'm going to use this.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:42.260]   This has been the most profitable Mac break weekly I've ever been on.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:49.060]   I have 16 8GB 2G iPhones from the old days in the office to get rid of it.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.780]   I'll tell you, I was talking to the founder of Gazelle.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:55.660]   Actually, it was their CTO the other day we went to dinner or lunch.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:57:02.100]   He said, when the iPhones come out usually in June, very busy because a lot of iPhone
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.260]   users want the new iPhone.
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:07.060]   And generally you're going to get the money that you're going to pay for the new iPhone
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.580]   back if not more.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.580]   If it's in good condition.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.820]   You haven't broken my son's not going to get any money for his iPhone.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.180]   Screen is all shattered and everything.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.980]   So it's a great way to upgrade your gadgets.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.460]   A couple of very, now we'll go through some very quick ones.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.820]   Market cap apple is now within striking this distance of Microsoft.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.660]   It's market cap has been going up and up.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.940]   Scottborn, you're our market analyst.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.340]   You got out of apple because you had to.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.700]   Are you sad now?
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.180]   You're 50 bucks now.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:48.940]   I was pretty happy to sell it 200, which was at that time that you predicted 200.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:49.940]   I predicted 200.
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:51.020]   I sold it 200.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.100]   I made a bunch of money.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.340]   Now it's 250.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.860]   And if you look at, you know, I'm a simple guy.
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:00.140]   Let me look at the P&E ratio and let me look at the cash on hand.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:05.460]   And I can tell you a lot about company and looking at 100 companies, the P&E ratio and
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:10.740]   the cash on hand for apple is about as good as it gets, baby.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:14.660]   When apple passed Dell a few months ago in market cap, Steve Jobs said an email to employees
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.060]   says, "Team, turned out Michael Dell wasn't perfect to predict in the future."
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:23.620]   Remember Michael Dell said, "I can't remember what the stock price was, but he said everybody
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.700]   should just sell apple off for parts."
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:30.100]   Based on today's stock market, close Steve says apple is worth more than Dell.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.940]   Stocks go up and down and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.940]   of reflection today.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.940]   They could buy Dell with cash.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.980]   They could, couldn't they?
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.780]   Market cap approaching $2 trillion.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:48.180]   I think that's right, $227.46 billion.
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:49.180]   And what's very significant is...
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:50.180]   No, no, it's not $2 trillion.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.340]   It's $227.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:56.100]   The number of mobile devices to max that create that number.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.460]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:01.060]   Exxon is number one, $264 billion.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:05.700]   Microsoft, $232 billion, Apple currently at around $227 billion market cap.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.140]   Then Walmart and Google.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.940]   Google by the way is only $154.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.500]   Look at the cash on hand now for those companies.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.220]   What is Apple's cash on hand?
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.060]   It says over $30 billion.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   It's a bunch.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.060]   It's a bunch.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.060]   It's a bunch.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.060]   Over $40 now?
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:23.660]   That changes the dynamic significantly.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.580]   Then look at their price earnings ratio.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:30.180]   I mean, this is a very healthy company with plenty of room to grow.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:35.220]   I wouldn't be shocked if we saw a $300 or a split.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:41.460]   Somebody in the chat room said Apple just popped a market cap and got the butt.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.460]   $97.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:45.940]   You can buy a 3GS at Walmart now.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.940]   That's incredible.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   Well, because you know why...
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.740]   It says $2 is $2 less than what it's expected to be other where other places are.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:52.740]   Right.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.460]   It'll be $100 bucks next month after the 4G, whatever it's going to be called.
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:56.460]   I thought that sounded pretty amazing too.
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:59.460]   And then I heard, well, it's just two buys less than it'll be.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   It's cheap now.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460]   It worked.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.460]   It worked though, Merle.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.460]   And it got me to think it was cheap.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460]   It's cheap now because...
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460]   Totally.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   I think it's fantastic.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.980]   I mean, is this the 3GS?
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   3GS.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980]   That's what I got.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.980]   It's a hell of a phone.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.980]   I got...
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:12.980]   Is it 32 gig?
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.980]   Is there something?
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.980]   Is that right?
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980]   Probably not.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.220]   I paid too much for this phone, Leo, the port.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.860]   Will you buy a 4G?
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.860]   Who's going to...
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.380]   You're all going to buy a 4G, of course.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.380]   She's Louise.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.380]   What am I even asking?
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:27.060]   Of course, Andy, you've already got yours.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.060]   He's got his.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.060]   We know that.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.060]   He's got a thunderous hat.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060]   That's what's behind the black curtain.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.060]   Uh-oh.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:36.100]   He's showing a Nexus one.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.300]   Did you switch off the iPhone to a Google phone, Andy?
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.500]   Oh, look, he's got the Apple logo on it.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.140]   I saw it earlier and wondered what the heck is that.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.340]   Andy, we can't hear your voice.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.100]   I don't know if it's because you're doing that thing that you do where you pretend.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:55.180]   The Google logo kind of pained me after I got that my phone sharing card on.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.020]   Andy, for those of you at home, Andy is holding up a Google phone with a big ass
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.020]   Apple logo.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.500]   Where we'd normally say Google, what else have you done?
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.740]   How else have you customized it?
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740]   Do you have Apple wallpaper?
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   Uh-oh.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.740]   What I've done is...
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.700]   Hang on, let me dip back.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:15.820]   I've taken the step of changing the home screen so it has the exact same layout of applications
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.020]   as what I'm used to on my iPhone.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.380]   So the camera app is where I expect it to be, the browser, the movie player, everything
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.700]   is where I expect them to be.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   You don't use widgets then.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.500]   Oh, yeah, you've got a widget on there.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:31.940]   I use... see, this is the limitation of Google.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.340]   They have really good ideas for widgets and things like that, but they should do is...
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.580]   The last thing they do, they should do before any company releases a Google phone or they
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.780]   release a gold master of the operating system is to simply give it to a room full of no
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:51.220]   more than three Google employees whose job it is to take this phone, set it up the way
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:55.100]   that they themselves would agree a human would like to use it, and then simply lock
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.260]   it down saying when you install this operating system, this is what the app...
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.780]   This is the layout of the applications.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.260]   This is when you go like this.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.060]   Here are the three widgets that are going to be on that one page.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.380]   We'll give a search page, we'll have a map page, we'll have a messaging widget all on
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.380]   the same page.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.340]   It really does take a couple of weeks before you feel as though you're really moved into
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.340]   an Android phone.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.340]   This is...
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.420]   I'm sorry, but that's Stockholm syndrome, Andy.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.060]   You've been in the Apple world so long.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.940]   You want Google to tell you how to lay your phone out.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.940]   Oh, no, no.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.940]   I just...
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.860]   It's like when you pick up your new car at the dealership, you drive it off a lot and
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.340]   it's the seats are adjusted perfectly and there are things programmed to the radio stations.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.860]   But when it comes to the dealer lot, it's wrapped in plastic and there are things all
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.100]   over the seats and the seats are like down at the lack position.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:45.540]   This is the difference between a company that understands that they are not shipping a product,
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.500]   they're actually delivering a product to actual users.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500]   And so if...
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.140]   My layout looks different from your layout and I'm sure it looks different from everybody
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.140]   else.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.140]   Oh, so your layout sucks.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.140]   Okay.
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.940]   By the way, by the way, I can't wait.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:02.260]   I'm going to get the HTC Evo sometime in the next couple of weeks and I think that is
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.540]   going to even be more amazing.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.020]   And they do, by the way, Andy, that...
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.060]   This is the Google experience which you get on a Droid or a Nexus One.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.980]   But if you get the HTC Evo or a number of other HTC handsets, HTC does exactly what
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980]   you're talking about.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.620]   They have kind of a set up, a default set up and it's very beautiful and very nice.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.420]   I have my review to plug the SunTime site again.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.500]   I did the print version of my HTC Incredible review last week.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.900]   That's the short 600 word or the longer version is hitting the SunTime site this week.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:37.460]   And really half of it is the difference between what Google thinks users want a phone to be
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.940]   and what HTC thinks.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.940]   Right.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.020]   Because they package this new UI package called Sense that keeps getting better and better
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.980]   and more and more impressive with each iteration.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:51.180]   I think it's almost as if a stock Google phone and an HTC phone with a Sense UI, it's almost
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.100]   like they're two completely different products.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.740]   I like the choice though.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.740]   Exactly.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.180]   I like the choice but I mean it really does elevate it to a new level.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:04.180]   If you've not used an Android phone since the G1, if someone shows you an HTC phone
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:07.620]   with Sense, you're like, "Oh, I didn't realize it was this good."
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.940]   No, I haven't used an iPhone since I got the Nexus One.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.940]   I've been very, very happy.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940]   Really?
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940]   Wow.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.660]   I have an iPad so I have the iPhone experience.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.780]   But do you find that it doesn't drive you crazy that you turn it on and you have to wait
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   and wait?
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.540]   I don't shut my phone off that off.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.540]   Okay.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.540]   You shut it off every night.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.220]   Yeah, I shut mine off and it takes forever.
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.300]   Actually, you actually power it off.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.340]   Apparently, it powers it off.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.820]   That's an alien experience to me, friend.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.820]   And?
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:37.820]   And?
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.180]   It is my backup phone.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.660]   I have to tell it to turn off three times.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.660]   I turn it off and it says, "Do you want to turn it off?"
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.660]   I hit it, "Yes.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.660]   I don't want to turn it off."
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   I hit, "Yes."
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.660]   I hit, "You know, it's a handstand off."
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.660]   Leave it on.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.660]   I can feel my mind going.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:53.660]   My name is Alex.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.660]   I'm trying to put a Facebook account on it.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.660]   Actually, be more absurd.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.660]   What do you think?
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:06.580]   I don't know if I haven't covered this story because I don't know if there's anything to
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.540]   say, but I'm going to bring it up.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.380]   We've got a really esteemed panel here.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.220]   Foxconn and the suicides there.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.460]   Is there a story there?
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.460]   What is...
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.460]   Oh, it's...
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.460]   Foxconn has...
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.700]   How many hundreds of thousands of people work at Foxconn?
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:23.700]   There are nine deaths in the last six months, which is a great jump from last year.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.700]   Okay.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:28.460]   But the question is that if we have a business, isn't it something like a half a million people
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.460]   who work there?
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.460]   It's huge.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.460]   It's huge.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.460]   Okay.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.460]   So if you have any...
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.460]   That's an entire industry of employees.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:35.460]   We look at the auto industry.
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:40.180]   If we look at the drug industry, if we look at the Martha Stewart living manufacturing industry,
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.580]   how many suicides are there every year?
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.300]   I'm guessing Martha Stewart's people killed themselves a lot more...
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.580]   A lot faster than both of them.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580]   There are eight...
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.580]   I like this.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.580]   I like this.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.580]   Eight hundred thousand employees.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:56.780]   So if you say there were 11 suicides in San Francisco in the last nine months, which
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.580]   is the same size, nobody would say...
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.620]   So it's the size of a city.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.020]   It's a medium-sized city.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.020]   However...
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.420]   You can talk about the Golden Gate Bridge than that.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.580]   No, in fact, that's true.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.580]   It's more than one of them.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   I think it's one of them.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580]   One of them.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580]   So it's 12 a year.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580]   So that's more than...
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580]   Well, what's the trend line?
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.580]   What's the trend line now?
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580]   I mean, it is going up.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:21.460]   And I think that there's some thought that maybe it's a very stressful place to work.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.260]   Does Apple have some responsibility for that?
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.260]   I don't know.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.260]   Well, I think we...
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.900]   Ever since they took the pepperoni pizza out of the cafeteria, things have gone down.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.900]   Let me ask you, Mr. Capitalist Scott Borne.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.900]   I'll ask you.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.900]   Too soon.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   I'll ask you.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.020]   Let me ask you, Scott Borne, Mr. Capitalist, do we as consumers have any...
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.380]   Bear any responsibility for the fact that we demand cheaper and cheaper products and as
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:47.820]   a result, we are pushing manufacture offshore to places where there are fewer labor laws
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.820]   and prices.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.260]   Our cost of labor is way lower.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.700]   Don't want bear some of that responsibility?
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.660]   We do share that responsibility as consumers.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.660]   I think it's horrible.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.420]   The markets always deal with these issues themselves.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.300]   Again, I trust markets.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.780]   And here's why.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.860]   Because there are people like...
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.260]   There's a grocery store in Gig Harbor that's not affiliated with national chains.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.500]   It's not even a whole foods, but it's whole foods like.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.100]   And everything's local produce.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.100]   It's grown by farmers.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:22.060]   And I pay like four bucks for a carton of eggs, but they're really good eggs and there's nothing
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.900]   injected into them.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.220]   And so there's a bounce back in the market with me rebelling against the mass-produced
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.380]   stuff for cheap.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.580]   And there are always people that are going to rather pay for quality.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.860]   And if enough of that happens, then things change.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:39.660]   But look at the airline industry where we see that people don't care about quality.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.620]   They just want the cheapest airline seat they can get.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.420]   And if the plane crashes every once in a while, they'll live with it.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.500]   I mean, you're right.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.060]   We do bear responsibility.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.060]   Hopefully markets will sort it out.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:56.220]   The least what economists would say is that when you push a jobs offshore that they may
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.540]   not have the same level of working conditions and environmental regulations and whatnot,
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:04.620]   but that it's better than what those people would have been doing otherwise.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.940]   And that people in those countries want those jobs because they are a step up from what
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.940]   they would have had previously.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:15.460]   I mean, I do think that there are plenty of room for problems there.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:21.300]   And Apple actually has a really fairly detailed document about what they expect from their
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:26.580]   suppliers and audit trails of what they go in and check to see what their suppliers
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.580]   are doing.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.460]   So, you know, maybe other companies have that too.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.300]   But I certainly haven't seen it publicized widely from other companies.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.540]   Or as Apple makes that stuff relatively public.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.020]   All right.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.820]   Lightning round, we're going to continue on.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:43.740]   Apple's selling more iPads than Max, at least according to RBC Capital Markets Analyst,
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.740]   Mike Abramsky, who upgraded his predictions from five million in the first year to eight
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.740]   million iPads.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:53.180]   He says, Apple's selling more than 200,000 iPads a week.
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:57.420]   That means they're outpass pacing the sales of Max in the United States, closing in on
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.580]   iPhone sales.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.580]   No question.
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.340]   The iPad's a huge success.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.420]   3G still sold out, isn't it?
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   In many stores.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:13.340]   A week-long wait in three cities we contacted this week, Detroit, Seattle, and I believe
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.500]   it was Miami.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.700]   I do have to say though that I think Andy, what you said at the beginning of the show
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.780]   is frankly the case, which is it's the form factor that wins.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:29.260]   I think you're to see success with Windows or Linux.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:35.100]   But I think you put another mobile operating system on a device of this caliber.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.340]   It's going to sell well too.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   Yes.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.460]   I think that Apple's biggest problem over the next six months is going to make sure that
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:45.860]   there are enough applications in the App Store right now that emphatically make the case
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:51.100]   that the iPad apps are superior in every way to any Android tablet apps that come across.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.100]   They have to.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:58.460]   Yeah, because otherwise, again, the iPad hasn't really won yet.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.820]   It's the only game in town for this sort of device.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.340]   Just like there was a time where there was no other music player on the market.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.460]   There was no other smartphone like the iPhone on the market.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.460]   Is it the form factor?
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.460]   Is it the shape?
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.460]   Is it the price?
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.980]   Or is it the fact that Apple has done something special with these ingredients and done them
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.980]   in a special way?
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.180]   We don't know that yet.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:21.260]   The law prohibits members of Congress from bringing an iPad onto the house floor.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.620]   However, that's for safety reasons, right?
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.700]   No tweeting allowed.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.500]   I don't know.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.420]   I've kind of torn about that.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:34.460]   On the one hand, there's a real value to having all the documents put you have your staffers,
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.980]   put everything on here instead of the big piles of books they're carrying.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:43.580]   But I also don't want my member of Congress playing Wii rule while there's something important
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.580]   going on.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:49.580]   You never know if you want the discussion porn and you know it.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:54.620]   In any event, a number of members of Congress, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Cliff Steams,
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:59.380]   I'm sorry, Stearns of Florida, Jeff Flake of Arizona, all have iPads.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:06.500]   They're proudly showing off Daryl Isa, Stephen, who's from California, Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts,
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.300]   replaced their orders.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.580]   And I'm surprised, Zollofgren, who is the member of Congress for the District of Apple,
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.300]   does not have one yet.
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.940]   They have their own district or something.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.140]   District of Apple, the district of Apple.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.140]   That's the...
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:24.460]   I think this sounds like the same kind of thing as like, you know, this, you know, you
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.660]   get to a certain age and you read enough and you start seeing patterns everywhere.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.460]   And this is the same thing that happens all the time with any new technology.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.260]   These two think pregnant ladies should ride on trains.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.860]   Well, it's true.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.700]   If the swing goes over the top, you'll turn inside out.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:44.740]   I thought it was interesting to be, it seems to be an automatic reaction to any kind of
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.380]   new technology.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.380]   Must be dangerous.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.380]   No, don't allow that on the house.
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:51.100]   Well, you can't bring any, you can't bring a computer on the house for you.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.100]   You can bring an iPhone on the house floor.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.100]   Well, then you should bring an iPad.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.100]   Yeah, come on.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:00.260]   See, this is just, you know, this is security theater.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:03.020]   You know, it's like, it's a...
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.260]   I mean, I'm serious, it's security theater.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:12.040]   I remember, you know, back in the day, I was coming out of the mess hall there at Fort
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.300]   Knox and they were searching everybody to make sure they didn't bring food back to the
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:17.540]   barracks.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.300]   So what they did was to...
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.300]   Made up the door.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.620]   The DI absolutely hated my guts.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.540]   So what they would do is have me wear an overstuffed coat.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.740]   I would walk out of the mess hall.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.340]   They would immediately search me.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:36.380]   And then the guys that were smuggling burritos back to our barracks were getting a free
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.860]   pass and then I got half the cut for being a draw.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.180]   And that's where your troubles began, Scott.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:43.180]   That's it.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:46.380]   So what I'm saying here is that this stuff never works.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:51.060]   I mean, if there's a security problem or a problem related to the iPad, it's just...
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.060]   It's all security theater.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.660]   They're finding some other way to do it.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.660]   One of our...
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   Totally, it's trying to like solve...
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:00.540]   I think you're trying to preserve the collegial environment where people talk eye to eye and
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.540]   face to face.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.500]   You're trying to solve the problem that they see and not the real problem.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.740]   I mean, the problem, as I tell my clients, the real problem behind every problem is
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.860]   try and make people be a great human being.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.580]   And anytime, and they can't do that, you can't make laws about that.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.780]   And so you end up doing all these squirrely things to try and make people behave differently
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:22.140]   by basically, you come up with these contrivances that any junior high school kid could route
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.540]   around, and I don't know.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.340]   The other thing, Scott, is I recently joined a men's choir called the Burrito Smugglers.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:31.580]   I don't know if that's the same kind of thing.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.580]   I saw the ad for that on the...
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.580]   That's right.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.020]   We're doing what we're going to do mostly Mozart.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.340]   And we're doing the LaSondheim review.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:44.140]   Listen, I came to one of your performances in the past.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.140]   Oh, thank you.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.620]   If you do another one, I'll be there.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:47.620]   All right.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:52.620]   ♪ Count me on a Sunday, please ♪
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.900]   Apple Relentzen now allows cash for iPads.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.140]   We had a story last week that a lady tried to buy an iPad with a WADA cash and was turned
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.140]   down.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:02.860]   They said, "You have to use a credit card."
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.380]   Now they say, "No, you could pay for cash, but you will have to set up a traceable Apple
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.380]   account so that we know who you are."
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:15.460]   Well, I was talking to a guy at the Syracuse Max Apple Store, a local music user group meeting.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:20.260]   And he said they were doing it purely because they had people coming up from New York City
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.940]   who were just buying them out.
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:22.940]   A city slickers.
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.940]   They're coming in there buying them out.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.740]   Well, they'd come up and they'd buy them out.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.700]   They'd come and go home and then they'd shift them overseas where you couldn't get them
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.700]   yet.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:31.700]   And so basically we would have...
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700]   We think they're giving them the aliens.
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.700]   Yes.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.700]   Worse.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.820]   They were trying to lock it down a little so they actually had something stuck for the
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   real customers.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.820]   Right.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.820]   No, I think it's the same thing with the iPhone.
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:43.820]   Where you had to buy in cash.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.820]   Pay cash.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.980]   I tune share of the US music market swells.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.540]   I don't like that.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.540]   Thank you.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:54.540]   The unofficial Apple web blog really knows how to write a headline.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.180]   Swells.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.180]   It's turgid to 20...
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.180]   Big burrito.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.180]   Since 26.7%.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.180]   That is now...
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.180]   Re-existing the show for new demographic.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.180]   I think so.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.180]   It's the midnight show Andy.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   It's the burrito smugglers.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:13.660]   It's the section the city to is coming out this week.
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:15.340]   You got to go with the ad dollars.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.020]   I perfectly am on board with this.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:18.100]   I'm taking that night off.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.700]   My wife has got a group of ladies.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.860]   They're all going to see the midnight show.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.580]   The hotel room right away.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.580]   Oh dear.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.180]   I don't want to be home.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.180]   Apple.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.180]   A lot of airbrushing.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.020]   There's a lot of airbrushing on that poster.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.020]   No.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.620]   You transition from airbrushing into CGI.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.620]   That was...
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:38.620]   It's true.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.220]   If those women were at that photo shoot, they were wearing those body suits with a ping
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.220]   pong ball so they could remap.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:50.380]   Kim Kitral is deep in the uncanny valley.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.980]   The ILM budget for this movie topped $1 billion.
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   That's what I heard.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.580]   You look more human when she played a Vulcan.
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.580]   Hey!
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:58.580]   Hey!
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   She's fighting Yoda with a lightsaber.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.580]   AT&T.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.260]   This should have led with this story.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:09.580]   AT&T wants to raise the early termination fee for the iPhone and other smartphones.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.380]   This $175.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.660]   You get out of your contract before the two years are up.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:21.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, when you buy your new 4G, you'll be paying $325.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.700]   Because AT&T loves you.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.700]   Sons of beaches.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:29.300]   You know, I want to have a business where you're compelled to buy from me.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.300]   That is beautiful.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.300]   I often said that.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.420]   What if the dry cleaner in the corner said, "Oh, you're moved to another dry cleaner?
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.060]   That'll be $150."
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.700]   Early termination fee.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.700]   We gave you a plastic bag.
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:41.700]   You owe us.
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:45.580]   That's a lot of buttons to push on the console to terminate the contract.
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.300]   We need to contact them and find out how much does it really cost.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.740]   There could be a lot of charges that they're eating.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.380]   Okay, Leo, they're eating these costs.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.180]   Oh, tapping the button 11 times to say, "No, he's no longer a subscriber."
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180]   Okay?
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.220]   Where is the FCC in all of this?
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.620]   That's what I want to know.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.700]   That is something to bring up.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.100]   I mean, this could be regulated if there are enough complaints.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.740]   Well, the FCC supposedly was investigating this a year ago.
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.780]   The Congress was made a big deal about it a year ago.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.780]   I don't know.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:13.780]   Apparently nothing's happened.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:20.820]   AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de La Vega said, "His company does not expect many iPhone customers
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.620]   to jump ship once AT&T loses exclusivity."
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:28.260]   No, at $325, I expect you're right.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.780]   Do you think that's what this is all about?
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.340]   They're taking the Facebook approach.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.900]   You don't have to buy an iPhone.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.060]   You don't have to buy from us.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:37.780]   Well, if you look at the press release, it's actually really funny because they say, "Some
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.460]   prices will be lower."
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.620]   And then a few paragraphs down, "Oh, the smartphone prices?
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620]   325."
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.580]   You've got to be able to come out and use a phrase for this, Adam.
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.580]   What's the phrase?
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:48.580]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.980]   I learned the phrase for this.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:51.980]   It's called a feature phone.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:52.980]   That's the new joke.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   It's a feature phone.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   Isn't that funny?
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   It's because it is a client.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   It's a feature.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   They were talking about blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.980]   I was talking about the feature phones.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:17:59.980]   I was like, "I know what a smartphone is.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:00.980]   What's a feature phone?"
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.060]   I was like, "Ah, phone's a nobody uses anything else."
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.060]   But the smart phone.
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.060]   The teenage girlfriend.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:12.780]   I think some of this came from a place that is actually, if not fair and logical, is at
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.780]   least sensible.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.260]   So you look at places like what?
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.900]   Again, I'm going to pull this out of my ass.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.780]   But things like MCI Sprint, you look at cable companies.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.620]   These people spent a lot on infrastructure in the '70s and '80s.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.020]   They put a lot of cable in the ground.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:29.860]   And then suddenly they woke up one morning and it wasn't as valuable as it used to be.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.020]   You think about all the money that went into long distance companies and stuff like that.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.580]   And so I think the idea is that people said, "No more."
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:39.020]   It isn't just you're going to be able to get away from this so quick.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.540]   We need to amortize the investment we put into this.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.540]   And I think at first probably I'm guessing people felt like they were entitled by saying,
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.900]   "Hey, look, you're a customer that enjoys that here in the pin drop.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.900]   You got to stay with us."
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:50.900]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:56.340]   It's just that now the trouble is with stuff like cable and AT&T in particular Comcast and
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.780]   AT&T, sorry, two companies I've got to bring up is that it's not like the providing great
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.780]   service.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:09.220]   It's that lock-in is so galling because to quote my friend Marco, they clearly despise
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.220]   their own customers.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.220]   Right.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.420]   It's not AT&T really does have a good customer service model.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.460]   We're not happy till you're not happy.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.500]   They're self-loathing monopolists and I feel for them.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   It's not easy.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500]   It is weird though.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.340]   I mean, again, I'm reaching a point in life where I'm trying not to overdramatize and
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:30.140]   trying to over-mythologize things.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:35.060]   It is, you see certain, you run into people like the woman I ran into at the copy center
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.980]   at the office depot on the corner of Six in Washington in Portland, Oregon.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.980]   I will never forget you.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   You run into these people where you're like, "You're just a sad tomato."
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   Right?
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.700]   You're just like, "Why are you in a business where you're trying to help people with a
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.500]   thing when you clearly hate life?"
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.820]   And with AT&T, it really sometimes feels like, "Wow, you got, you haven't got the world
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:54.980]   on a string.
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.620]   You could build a relationship where nobody would want to get away from you.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:03.020]   Instead, you got this totally crap service with the greatest phone in the world.
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:07.220]   And then if we try to do anything with you, it costs money and you treat us like a red
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.220]   head stepchild.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.860]   I guess what I'm getting at is like, it just seems like there's such a pattern for trying
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:14.940]   not to do that deliberately.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.100]   It's almost like a dare.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.940]   It's like a dare to go try and find someplace else.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.940]   And I've done it.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.100]   I bought my way out of sprint happily.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:23.060]   I was like, I've been with them for 10 years.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.060]   I've never been treated so badly.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.060]   No, I think they're all stuck though.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:27.780]   I mean, Verizon, by the way, early termination is the same.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.780]   They raise their months ago.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:29.780]   They all suck.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:30.780]   That's an important point.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.220]   They do it because it works.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:37.780]   If I want to withdraw 20 bucks for an ATM, why is the other bank's ATM charging me 12%
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.780]   big on the money I'm withdrawing?
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:44.060]   Not because they're evil, but because, hey, if we have that rate, most people will not
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:49.900]   bother to walk three blocks away to find a bank of America or a TSI ATM in order to get
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.900]   that done.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:51.900]   So this is how we'll say that.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.260]   We give AT&T a bad rap.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:56.100]   But some cases, they're not that terrible.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.100]   I mean, look at the iPad rates, Sam.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.580]   There's a new commercial I can see it now.
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:02.660]   In some cases, we're not that terrible.
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.660]   They're iPad rated with the-
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:04.660]   They're iPad rated with the-
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.660]   They're iPad rated with the-
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.420]   One time so low because you can't use it on anything but an iPad, right?
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:11.860]   Well, but you look at the iPad rates anywhere else in the world, they're way higher.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.660]   You look at the roaming rates from just about anyone else, they're higher in the world.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:19.980]   AT&T, whether or not they want to do it, whether or not Apple just put the screws to
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.460]   them and said you're going to charge a reasonable rate.
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.420]   Who knows why, but that's not terrible.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.060]   Adam, you know why?
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.700]   To use an old phrase, that's how they get you.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.700]   That is-
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.940]   I mean, I think that's part of the thin end of the wedge.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:35.740]   Yeah, you can cancel, but now you're on the books.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:39.580]   Like you are an AT&T customer and I just have to guess that they're smart enough to
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:43.260]   know that you can escalate a relationship, a step at a time.
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.420]   If you love that iPad, your dance are going to pick up an iPhone.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.420]   I have a feeling.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:50.900]   I'll tell you what, I think that AT&T did that kicking and screaming.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:55.060]   My feeling is that Apple had him over a barrel, said you want to keep the iPhone, you're
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:01.700]   going to give us a good price on the iPad because we want you to be happy.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.060]   I don't think that they had much of a choice.
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:07.940]   That's why we still, by the way, have to buy an iPhone from AT&T.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.220]   That's exactly why.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.740]   That's unfortunate.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:11.740]   The minute.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.300]   No, let me rephrase that.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:18.340]   The nanosecond, that I can get my iPhone to work on Verizon, I'm going to say audio is
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:23.620]   to AT&T and if I have to pay $3,750 to do it, I will happily do it.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.980]   I'm not an AT&T customer.
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:29.620]   I'm a T-Mobile customer with my Nexus One and I expect to be a Sprint customer as soon as
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.620]   that Evo comes because I just got to ask him.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   That's a question.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:33.620]   That's a good question.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.620]   Am I going to regret that I got this Verizon MyFi?
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.620]   So far, I am so digging it.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.620]   Oh, no, it's great.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.620]   It's great.
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.620]   I love it.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.620]   What's the bandwidth on it?
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:43.620]   What's the limit on it?
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.620]   It's going to vary.
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.820]   I'm getting five gigs of months.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.540]   Oh, no way.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.540]   That's awesome.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:51.540]   Okay, great.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.540]   I have been loving this thing.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.540]   You can exceed it once.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.860]   I mean, I've never been cut off.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.220]   I have gigs, my God.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:01.340]   I just took it on the road for the first time and it never felt so good to not have to
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.820]   hit that radio button for 9 minutes.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.620]   That's what it's kind of cool to have a 3G iPad.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:05.620]   I mean, that's what I got.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:06.620]   That's what I got.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:07.620]   I got that.
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.620]   You got that, so am I.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620]   My Fi.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620]   I apologize.
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:11.620]   Go ahead.
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.180]   No, I'm just talking along next to you.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.500]   We're driving parallel down the highway.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.700]   I got dropped a lot, Leo.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.020]   I don't think right.
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.020]   Sorry.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.340]   That's why one side of your head is a little flat.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.340]   I noticed that.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.340]   Shut up.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.540]   You're a friend with Mr. Hodgman.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:31.100]   Has he shed a tear over the end of the I'm a Mac ads?
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.100]   We're trying to get him on.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.100]   I'd like to get him on.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.820]   In fact, I'd like to get him adjusted on.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   That's wonderful.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.820]   Maybe next week if John if you're...
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.820]   They know their pal so he could probably...
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.820]   Well, Justin Long says so many good things about John Hodgman.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.740]   I mean, he really looked up to him.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:50.580]   Here from the One More Thing podcast is a tribute to the I'm a Mac as I haven't previewed
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:51.580]   this.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.820]   He'll give me if it's profane or anything.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:56.980]   Did I press the wrong button?
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.980]   What the hell?
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   I got Nevada.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.500]   What the hell happened there?
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.620]   Leo, could you forget your medicine?
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.620]   I got dropped on my head.
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:05.620]   Where the stage is...
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:06.620]   How did I get this?
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.620]   I don't want Nevada.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.420]   I think you got a bad bit.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.420]   I'm going to guess.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   Thank God.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:12.420]   It's a man.
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:16.020]   I like Nevada as much as the next guy, but I'm not...
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.500]   You're hoping pay for the Internet.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.500]   Congratulations.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.620]   Nevada, we'll let you gamble.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:23.620]   There's the tribute right there.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.860]   I hope you enjoyed that tribute.
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:25.860]   What the hell is this?
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:26.860]   Oh, I...
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.860]   It's a retrospective.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.860]   I've seen this.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.860]   It's lovely.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.100]   This is from the One More Thing.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.100]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.100]   And I'm a PC.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.100]   Hey, Mac, did you hear the goodness?
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.100]   PC Choice Chad.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.100]   PC Choice Chad.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.100]   Sorry, I didn't hear you there.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.100]   What'd you say?
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.100]   This...
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.900]   PC number two.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.500]   Allow me to introduce the top of the line, PC.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.500]   Hey, oh wow.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.500]   Hey.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.500]   Okay.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.500]   Thanks.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.500]   Oh, man.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.220]   Well, I'll go on, rip it in half nonsense.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.220]   It's beautiful.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:58.140]   Dad, he needs an upgrade.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.860]   And I'm having a very difficult time finding pictures of my friend.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:04.860]   I couldn't hear you through my virus-proof mask.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.860]   So, Bonjourno.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.860]   Hello.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]   That's good of commercial.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   I love John Hydman.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:17.540]   Let's go to another commercial.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.540]   Your first class all the way.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540]   PC.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.540]   I banish you.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.540]   You're banished.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.020]   Oh, I have to go listen to some emo.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.780]   Cheers to innovation.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:33.980]   Where am I supposed to go?
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:34.980]   Oops.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   How did that happen?
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:37.980]   I'm a PC too.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   And I...
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:39.980]   What?
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:40.980]   I'm so proud of you for doing this, pal.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:41.980]   This is great.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:45.620]   PCs are now 100% trouble free.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:46.620]   Whoa.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.700]   Keep an eye on it.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.220]   What be for the whole entire world?
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.780]   Advertising, advertising, advertising.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:54.780]   Exfistent.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.780]   Look at PC.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780]   What are you talking about?
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:59.300]   I think I got a crash.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.300]   If you feel it.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.580]   Operators, a standing bot.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   I want to buy a computer.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.580]   Now what?
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:06.140]   Why are you talking like that?
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.380]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.380]   Yeah, dude.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.020]   PC is definitely faster.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:12.020]   It's Max Vault.
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.980]   You're doing a good job, Mac.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:14.980]   Nice.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:15.980]   Hey.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.340]   Oh, that kind of better.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:20.380]   It's not going to have any of the problems windows do have.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.380]   Trust me.
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.460]   Yeah, I think we're going to take the search.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.460]   Hi.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.860]   I'm a Mac home movie.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:27.860]   What's up?
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.860]   PC Home Movie.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.740]   You know how it is.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.540]   PC, you are a wizard with numbers and you dress like a gentleman.
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.460]   You are coming to a sad realization.
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:38.460]   Cancel or allow?
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.460]   Shut this down.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.460]   What are you doing?
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.460]   Cut off the air.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.420]   So many users.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.380]   Leaving me.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:55.180]   And they ain't coming back.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.860]   This does got issues.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.380]   It's so glitchy.
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:02.940]   They're leaving me for Mac.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.980]   That's great, actually.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:08.540]   Problems to dark and many.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:13.460]   Crashes, not enough.
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.460]   Expensive upgrades.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:23.060]   Well, I need plenty just to get me up to snuff.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:27.860]   People who hate it when I crash and freeze.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:32.340]   Vistas got me out of sorts.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:42.660]   I'm often sick to some degree and I'm old with tax support.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:47.300]   After a year of fixes, well, I'm still blue.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:51.780]   The problems they repeat.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:56.620]   Now there's only one thing left to do.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.660]   Control, halt, delete.
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:02.900]   Isn't that great?
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.900]   Nice touch.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.580]   Is that your dog?
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.580]   No.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:13.740]   The problem is, though, for Brosman is that he, anytime he peers anywhere in just a sensible
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.540]   suit, they'll think he's a pretty, really big delivery day.
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:20.260]   It's like foul Kilmer appearing at the mall like in his Batman costume.
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.260]   Yep.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.020]   John will always be 007 to us.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:24.020]   Yes.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.020]   You'll never live the down.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:28.020]   One of the great ad campaigns of all time for the last three years, I'm surprised they're
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:32.060]   killing it, but I guess they're working on a new ad campaign.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:37.620]   We're seeing on Twitter people auditioning for the next Apple ad campaign.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.380]   148 characters at a time.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:43.100]   Twitter auditions.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:44.100]   We shall see what those are.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:48.540]   And thanks again to the One More Thing podcast for that great edit.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.740]   A tribute to Get A Mac.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:54.620]   We're going to have our picks of the week coming up in just a little bit.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.900]   But before we do, I do want to pick a great book for you from audible.com.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.660]   Audible is the place to go for your audio books.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.780]   75,000 strong.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:07.660]   I'm a very happy audible platinum subscriber, two books a month.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:09.140]   Actually, I'm grandfather then.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:12.220]   I have something even older called a light listener plan.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:15.020]   It's the same thing, two books, two books a month.
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.460]   But we're going to sign you up for the gold account.
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.460]   That's a book a month.
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.460]   It's a good way to start.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.180]   You'll probably want to ramp up in time, but the first one is free.
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.180]   See?
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.340]   That's how we get you.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:29.220]   And let me tell you, the only trouble you're going to have is picking that first book.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:32.380]   There are so many wonderful books on audible.com.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:36.260]   They do such a great job of making these books.
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:38.180]   Some of them, they record themselves.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:42.740]   Play on almost over 500 different devices, including all the Apple devices, including
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.660]   the iPad, the iPhone, the iPod.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:50.060]   But also, soon to come to the Android platform, they're in the beta right now.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.300]   I understand.
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.180]   And you're just going to love it.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.020]   Andy Inako always has something good for us to listen to.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.780]   You got to pick for us this week?
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:29:59.780]   Absolutely.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:04.460]   This is the 30th anniversary of the cinematic release of one of the most awesome or asked
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.100]   films of all time.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.100]   I know the rest of you can fill in the blanks here.
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:13.500]   It is the Empire Strikes Back by Mr. George Lucas and a cast of incredible awesome filmmakers.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.660]   That's a movie.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:16.660]   That is a movie.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:21.180]   But it was so successful that National Public Radio did a radio dramisation version of the
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:26.620]   entire movie, including many of the original cast, including Anthony Daniels and Mark Hamill.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:30.780]   You're not going to believe this, but they also managed to get Billy D Williams on board.
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.460]   So now who does John Lithgow's on this to?
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.460]   Is he Darth Vader?
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:36.900]   No, John Lithgow is Yoda.
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:42.620]   I think I've already sold this title for most of my friends right now.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:44.620]   It's great.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.700]   It's almost four and a half hours long.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:51.300]   You'll remember that the movie itself is only about two hours and 40 minutes long.
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:56.740]   So it works of all the dramisations that they did of the Star Wars series.
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:31:01.620]   This is absolutely the best one because there are little lines and little extra scenes that
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:05.940]   just add little bits of backstory, not the sort of nerdy backstory where...
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:09.820]   Yes, but what did Dak have to eat before he got into the snow speeder?
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:13.340]   I thought I saw a mustard stain on his left, the left side of his cheek.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:18.500]   It's just little more character moments that flesh it out a little bit better.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:23.620]   I have it on CD and I actually pulled it out a couple of weeks ago and re-rept him and
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:24.860]   was listened to in my car with past...
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.980]   I remember listening to this when it was on NPR, but I didn't know you could get it.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:28.980]   So that's fantastic.
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:29.980]   It is fantastic.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:30.980]   I had the Star Wars one.
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:31.980]   Yeah, the Star Wars one was excellent.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.300]   Here, you want to hear a little...
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.860]   This is Empire Strikes Back.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:37.820]   Keep in mind, it's not just a reading of the novelisation.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.020]   It is an actual radio play version of it.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.020]   Awesome.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:44.220]   Yes, Lieutenant.
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:48.460]   Sir, Imperial Headquarters reports that a rebel convoy has been completely destroyed
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:49.620]   near Dora IV.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:52.780]   At least someone is seeing a little action.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:56.900]   Let's hope that we do before the rebellion is completely obliterated.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.980]   What is the status of our probe droid operation?
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:31:59.980]   The probe droid we...
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.260]   No, I think any book where they could say what is the status of our probe droid operation?
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:05.260]   Straight face load.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.260]   Hello, Ringtone, yes.
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:11.100]   That's great stuff.
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:15.140]   Even if you know the movie inside and out as I do, it's still fresh and interesting.
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.140]   Wonderful recommendation.
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:19.740]   Star Wars Empire Strikes Back, but that's just one of 75,000 titles.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:25.460]   You can get your first book free at audible.com/macbreak.
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:26.460]   I'm an audible fanatic.
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.220]   I've been listening to Time Traveler's wife and I just...
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.140]   I can't get enough of it.
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.140]   I just love it.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:33.380]   I mean, I'll watch the movie and I loved the movie.
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:37.460]   By the way, it's a great movie, but the book has so much more detail and so much more going
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:38.460]   on.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.180]   I always like to listen to the book before I see the movie.
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:43.340]   So if you haven't seen the Empire Strikes Back...
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:45.140]   No, see the movie first.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140]   Okay, all right.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.020]   That's one exception.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.540]   Congratulations on your release from that murder of that moan.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.940]   I would have to be a multiple murder rapper here in jail for 30 years.
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:54.420]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:59.620]   Hey, Andy, let's get our pick of the week from Andy and Otko of the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.820]   This is a very simple tool, cheap tool.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:05.260]   It's from a company called JS8Media.com.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:08.820]   It's called Audio Refurb.
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:14.300]   It is a very, very simple audio reprocessor that does a lot of things that you can do in
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:15.300]   GarageBand.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.380]   You have a huge multi-band equalizer.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.660]   You have a big bank of effects.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.020]   Each of these pop-up effects.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.900]   If you want to add a little bit more to the bottom, if you want to add a tone down the
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.180]   reverb, if you want to do some flanging, I'm making up lots of turns because I'm not an
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.180]   audio engineer.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.540]   The point is that if you have an existing recording that you think is pretty good, but
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:35.140]   it's missing a little bit of something or you can just sort of sense that, "Ooh, there's
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.220]   just a lot in the middle that's just not there that needs to be gooseed up."
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:39.220]   I used to do this.
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:46.900]   There's something that I do a lot when I've ripped a DVD and there's a song on that DVD
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:51.540]   that is not available on CD because it's a 30-year-old movie or something.
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.740]   I want that as an MP3 just so I can listen to it.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:56.980]   It's in stereo, but the audio quality is a little bit off.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.220]   You can do these sort of things in GarageBand, but I find it's just so slow and it's just
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:02.420]   so cumbersome.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:05.980]   And oftentimes, I will only do this for songs that I'm really, really interested in.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:09.420]   An audio refurb, it's a simple $20 utility.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:12.900]   I think it's a full demo before you pay the money that will just let you get in and get
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.340]   out and process that file really, really quickly.
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.500]   I believe it'll also handle the conversion to MP3 without having to dump it over into
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.500]   iTunes.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:25.340]   So if you're a big fan of the right tool for the right job, as opposed to using one
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:28.900]   tool for just about everything you want to throw at it, it's an easy 20 bucks to spend.
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:32.860]   They have a couple other tools that I was neck and neck between audio refurb, which is
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:37.460]   a tool that I use once a week or so, and another thing they do called audio lobe that does
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:38.940]   nothing but control.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:43.660]   It will just re-burn a copy of this song that's been sped up or slowed down as you see fit.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:49.740]   So if you are as me, I've really kind of awesome, I just say awesome, I'm awful.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.260]   You collated with player.
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.260]   Awesome.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.500]   It will let you awesome at my awfulness.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.980]   I believe I'm unprecedented in the badness to which I'm capable of.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.620]   But if you want to learn a new song that you're a fan of, you can download a song, whatever
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:06.980]   reprocess it, an audio lobe to slow it way, way, way, way down so you can figure out
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.100]   where the chords are and how he's playing it.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:12.660]   And then now here's the big, here's the most important part where the $15 for audio lobe
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.660]   kicks in.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:23.100]   You then recorded in GarageBand at the same speed at which you rehearsed it half speed
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.340]   because that's all about only fast as you can play it.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.940]   Then you put it back into audio lobe and then amp it back up to its original speed.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.260]   So now it's like, my God, he's like Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:36.620]   Yes, if you let me, if you let, if I can play those chords at one 16 speed as Stevie Ray Vaughan
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:40.860]   and then just reprocess it, it's a good $15 if you want to create a false reputation for
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.500]   you being a skilled guitar player or keyboardist.
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.740]   Hey, I never stop Miley Cyrus.
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:46.740]   You just go for it.
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.780]   You just go for it, man.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.340]   Thank you, Andy Inato and Mr. Merlin, man.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:53.580]   Your pick of the week this week, sir.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.780]   I'm looking for the price on this.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:58.420]   I, excuse me.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.180]   I was listening outdoors.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:02.180]   At night.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.180]   And I don't know.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.180]   I'll get to you to a plug here for Max Funcon, which is the best thing ever.
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.180]   Something our friend, Jesse Thorn, put on.
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:09.180]   Jesse Thorn.
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:14.100]   He does the sound of young America, the wonderful ratio and podcast that everyone should donate.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.100]   Jesse puts on this thing called Max Funcon.
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   And it's an event that people like us and you look nice today and Mr. Hodgman and Mr.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:24.740]   Colton and, gosh, who else was there, Andrew WK and a bunch of people just going.
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.740]   It's just really awesome.
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:27.740]   So I'm going to go to the next one.
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.740]   This was Andrew WK and a bunch of people just going.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.740]   It's just really awesome.
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:34.740]   The celebration of awesomeness.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   Anyway, I was there outside and it was really dark.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.740]   It's at Lake Hair, Hairhead, California.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.300]   So it was very dark and you can see the stars.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:43.100]   And for some reason, I know where I thought, you know, I like astronomy, but I don't understand
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.100]   it.
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.460]   I like to know more.
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.500]   So I sat there and spent $40 on astronomy applications.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:53.500]   My phone before finding one that I think is pretty amazing and it's called Distant
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.500]   Sun.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:00.540]   And basically, Distant Sun lets you point your phone at the sky and it shows you everything
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:01.540]   that you're seeing.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.900]   You can't see it on camera right now, but I could point it up.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.660]   I'll show you the sun, the moon, whatever, any constellations.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.620]   And you can see that if you're on video.
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:12.420]   Sorry, I apparently don't know how mirrors work.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.540]   But you can see as it's sort of the equivalent of mouse is over a constellation, it fills
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.140]   in with a little drawing to like shade the constellation.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.500]   It's got tons of widgets.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:21.500]   There's a bunch of these.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:25.220]   This is actually a pretty interesting for how specific this audience is.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.540]   There's a bunch of neat apps, but I really like Distant Sun's.
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:32.220]   You can say, "Jomi Comets, show me things that are happening right now."
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:36.860]   It utilizes obviously the, you know, all the jazz that the phone has, the gloromer, stuff
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.860]   and all that.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:41.340]   And I just thought it was really neat for somebody like me who doesn't really understand.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.300]   I feel like one Stephen Hawking book and I have a phone.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.780]   So it was a perfect pairing.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.380]   Do they have an iPad version or it's just iPhone?
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:51.460]   You know, I'm not sure.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.460]   They may.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:54.940]   But there's a bunch of these.
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:55.940]   I bought several of these.
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:38:02.020]   I was sitting there with my very good friend Kevin Murphy because I'm a nerd.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:05.700]   And it was filled to be talking to somebody from that program.
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.940]   A P-universe is another one I got.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:10.860]   Panoscope, very cool.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:14.140]   But yeah, I'm going to go with Distant Sun's because I don't know.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.180]   It's something really interesting and humbling.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.220]   I'm thinking about our person, the universe.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:21.820]   And sometimes when you're smoking a Nicaraguan and staring at the sky, the phone can help
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:22.820]   you.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.820]   There's my daughter.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.820]   There she is.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:25.820]   Aww.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:26.820]   There's that.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:27.820]   There's Eleanor.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:28.820]   Hello.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.820]   Got you.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.820]   There.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:31.820]   Oh, there.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:32.820]   That's better.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:33.820]   Okay.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:34.820]   So yeah, Distant Sun's.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:35.820]   Very cool.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   Andy, Andy, a follow up on last week's.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.820]   Andy, I have that air sharing.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:38.820]   I still can't make it use Dropbox.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.820]   I think I'm crazy, but air sharing, I want it to follow up.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:40.820]   It's a great, great app.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.980]   It was a really good pick.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:42.980]   And I'm just loving it.
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:47.340]   I'm still using Good Reader more because I think it does more of what I immediately need.
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:51.500]   But the air sharing is so much prettier.
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.500]   Thank you, Merlin, man.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.220]   Distant Suns from Distant Suns.com.
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:59.660]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Scott Born of scottborn.com with his pick of the week.
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:03.780]   My pick of the week is something I'm about to review over at photofocus.com.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:06.460]   And it's a little less than an Alex if you're buying it new.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:09.060]   It's a lot less than an Alex if you're upgrading.
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.420]   And that would be Adobe Photoshop CS5.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:12.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:13.420]   All right.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:14.420]   I haven't played with it yet.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.420]   What do you think?
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:19.580]   Well, it is, if you're a photographer, it is the upgrade you need.
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:23.940]   I can't speak as to whether or not designers or illustrators, the other contingents that
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.260]   buy Photoshop will like it.
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:29.140]   But I can tell you, if you're a photographer at rock, a couple of important points.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:33.180]   Number one, it ships with built-in noise reduction that's better than any of the plugins you've
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.180]   been using.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.180]   Really?
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.260]   So you don't need things like noise ninja anymore.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:38.940]   It has great built-in noise reduction.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:44.540]   Number two, if you're into that crazy, crazy HDR tone mapping in who isn't, you no longer
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.300]   need Photomatics Pro.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:51.900]   You can just do all of your, the HDR has always been available in Photoshop since about CS3.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:55.020]   However, the thing is lacked is tone mapping.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.180]   So Adobe fixed that in CS5.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:01.380]   You can now tone map your HDR images, which is the crucial second step to make a photograph.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.380]   Look like a photograph.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:05.060]   You got that, the content aware fill.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.780]   Everybody's seen that demo online.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.660]   It's very amazing.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.620]   Edge refinement is superb.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.660]   It's just a very powerful program.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:18.700]   And if you have one of the newer computers with a nice GPU and lots of RAM, it's smooth
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.580]   as butter.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:23.300]   And it's 189 at Amazon to upgrade.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:25.860]   It's quite a bit more to buy it brand new.
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:26.860]   It's like six.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.860]   It's an Alex.
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:29.660]   I think the definition of an Alex is of course.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.340]   Hey, Scott, I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.340]   You may.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.660]   You said there were two things that helped something really look like a photo over the
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:35.660]   two.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.660]   Toning?
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:37.660]   Toning?
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:41.180]   Well, if you're going to do an HDR photograph in Photoshop before you could not do tone mapping
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.180]   now, you can.
[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:45.060]   And tone mapping is the second step.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:49.220]   And most professional photographers have used a piece of software called Photomatix Pro
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.180]   for a long time to make that happen.
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.700]   But you can save money.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:56.060]   You can justify the purchase of your Photoshop because you don't need noise ninja.
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.620]   You don't need Photomatix Pro.
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:01.260]   And you can do all of that natively in Photoshop.
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:03.540]   It's faster.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.540]   The interface is very, very consistent.
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:07.980]   Is it 64-bit for Mac now?
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.020]   If you have the right configuration on Snow Leopard and all that?
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.020]   Yeah, good.
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:16.220]   Now, they've convinced me because I've been sitting on CS4 for a while.
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:17.220]   You convinced me.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.220]   Well, there is one question.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.220]   Has it finished installing?
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:26.220]   By the way, you know what I'm saying?
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:30.020]   You really shouldn't accept the floppy option.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.020]   They're available on DVD now.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:36.300]   The other thing I want to warn you about, Leo, is if you've got a lot of plug-ins.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.300]   I do.
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.300]   CS4.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:40.300]   They will not work in CS5.
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.820]   Chopas and the Nick Collection.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.620]   You have to wait for them to be updated.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.980]   So that's kind of one of the bummers.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.180]   Maybe I'll wait.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.420]   But that's my pick.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.180]   CS5 Photoshop from Adobe.
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.260]   Now, Adam, I don't know if we warned you that we do this pick thing.
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:55.260]   Would you like to play?
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:56.260]   Let me go last.
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.100]   I gave you some time to think about it.
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:05.220]   Well, I mean, you review stuff in tidbits every week.
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:06.900]   So I know you got something in there.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.100]   There's lots of things.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.900]   But I'm also sort of trying to catch up on what you've already done.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:11.900]   Don't worry about that.
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.100]   You don't have to worry about that.
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.260]   You get to see it.
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:17.580]   Our guests get to pick anything they want regardless of...
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:22.180]   Well, I was going to say Good Readers definitely was on my list until Merlin's sort of implied
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.820]   that it was talked about last week.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:24.820]   I love it.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.820]   I love it.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.820]   I love it.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820]   We've published PDF books.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:29.820]   Good Reader is just the way to go.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.940]   But I wanted to actually change gears a little bit.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:36.620]   And since it is sort of in honor of our being here for 20 years, I wanted to talk about
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:40.660]   a program that's been on the Mac possibly longer than just about anything else in continuous
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.380]   development that I use regularly and really like.
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.900]   And it's unfortunate that it's not well better known.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:51.580]   Proview development's panorama database.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:58.180]   And it's been on the Mac since 1984, which is pretty darn cool to have a program that's
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.180]   actually still around in its...
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:02.740]   That's like before Helix.
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:03.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:04.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:05.740]   It's amazing.
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:10.220]   So the thing that Panorama is RAM based, which used to be a big deal because it made it faster
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.420]   than hard disk this.
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:16.700]   But what I really like about it is that I'm not really a database guy.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:21.220]   And so if you're a serious database guy, you put a lot of thought into your database
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.220]   ahead of time.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.220]   You set up your indexes.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:29.620]   You know what you want in and you want out and you get it all right to begin with.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:33.900]   But what I like about Panorama and the reason why I use it is that I can just do something
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:35.140]   really simple.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.900]   It uses a spreadsheet view as your sort of base view.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.780]   You can make all the fancy forms and whatnot you want.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:45.540]   But the spreadsheet view is a way that a lot of people think about data.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:48.340]   And it's a very easy way to get started.
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.380]   And then as you think about new things, you can add them in.
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:58.220]   And so I built a fairly complicated royalty management system for take control in Panorama
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:02.620]   starting from, okay, I get this text file from our shopping cart.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:05.900]   How am I going to figure out how much I owe each of my authors?
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.420]   And it's grown and grown.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:12.020]   And now it's like six interlinked databases and various different things.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:15.420]   And I didn't have to know what I wanted ahead of time.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:21.540]   I was able to evolve the database as I went, which is my understanding from working with
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.860]   other database systems, usually pretty hard in other database systems.
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:29.900]   It's usually a big refresh if you want to say, well, now I need to do this other completely
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.460]   different thing.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:35.060]   So that's been a real help for us and for our business.
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:37.660]   And it's just a fun little program.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:42.940]   And the guy who does it, Jim Ray is just the best guy ever writes his own documentation,
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.900]   thousands of pages, does his own support.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:46.820]   He's really on top on the ball.
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:50.020]   Yeah, I see Jim every year at Macworld.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.300]   It's a great company and a really neat guy.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.540]   And you're right.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.340]   We haven't picked him.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.140]   And I think it's good to highlight it.
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:02.700]   It's a really great tool that people probably knew about once and they've forgotten about,
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.700]   right?
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:04.700]   Are they still around?
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.700]   And they're up to version six now, which is great.
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.700]   Good kick out.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.260]   It's got plenty of new features.
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:13.020]   One of the features in version six actually that's really cool is it's what I call the
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.540]   Eudora feature.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:19.100]   You control click on any piece of data, like a date in a database.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:23.460]   And then you can say, show me more like this.
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:26.820]   So you just click on a control click on a piece of data and say, show me all the records
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:30.140]   from this date or after this date, things like that.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140]   It's just brilliant.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140]   Really cool.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.300]   Thank you for your pick.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.460]   And thank you for tidbits 20 years.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:37.860]   I'd like to say for the record, thank you also.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:42.700]   I mean, you've been around doing this for so long and in my early-ish days of taking
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:47.060]   the Mac seriously to bits was just it was the only thing of its kind.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.460]   And so other stuff came along and come and gone.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:53.620]   I just want to thanks for doing that because it was huge to a lot of us in the early days.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:54.620]   It still is.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:55.940]   I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.580]   I steal most of my stuff from my from tidbits.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:02.540]   It's a great resource.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.260]   Apple news for the rest of us.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:05.820]   T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:12.780]   And don't forget also the publishing arm of the tidbits folks because they've got the
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:13.780]   in control stuff.
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:18.860]   There's tons of it in every aspect of Macintosh and iPhone.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:21.060]   And it really is fantastic.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.340]   Adam, it's been great having you on.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.340]   Thank you for joining us this week.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.340]   Really appreciate it.
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:25.340]   Thanks for having us.
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.340]   Because we're so over time.
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:27.340]   I just was just...
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.340]   [laughter]
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:30.040]   But I do.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.040]   I will say this.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.040]   It is towel day.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.040]   And let's not forget that.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:39.140]   Of course, the day that Doug to commemorate Douglas Adams, the great author of The Hitchhiker's
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.940]   Guide to the Galaxy.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:50.460]   Towel day is kind of a harkens back to the important towel in the book.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:53.140]   And Douglas Adams passed away on May 25th.
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.340]   Gosh, how long has it been now?
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:56.340]   Ten years ago?
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.340]   2001, I think.
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:58.340]   Wow.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:46:59.340]   Almost ten years.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.340]   He passed away May 11th.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:02.660]   So towel day is May 25th of every year.
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.460]   Don't panic, my friends.
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:07.260]   But do carry your towel.
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.340]   And remember the great Doug with Adams.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.540]   Thank you everybody for being.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.540]   Don't panic.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:12.540]   Don't panic.
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:13.540]   Don't panic.
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:15.340]   Annie and I coz at the Chicago Sun times.
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:16.340]   Oops.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:19.180]   That's not him.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.180]   What is that iPad doing?
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:21.940]   He's been replaced by iPad.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:22.940]   Annie and I coz at the Chicago Sun.
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:23.940]   There's an app for that.
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.380]   There's an app for Andy.
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.340]   There is not Chicago Sun times.
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:32.300]   And don't forget his website www.cwob.com.
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:33.580]   That's where you'll find Andy's writings.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:37.540]   But I have to say this stuff you've been writing for the Sun times has been just fantastic
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:38.540]   lately.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:39.540]   Really enjoyed all of that.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:40.540]   Great, Mr. Ralton newspaper.
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:41.540]   Thanks for your advertising money.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.540]   Keep it going, folks.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:46.100]   Merlin Mann is at 43folders.com.
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:49.820]   You look nice today, which is still the funniest podcast on the internet.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:52.140]   You look nice today.com.
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:54.020]   He also does a number of other websites.
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:56.180]   But I think if you go to 43fold, did you probably find everything?
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.140]   If you've never listened to the show, our last episode is the first really good live
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.140]   show we've ever had.
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.620]   I'm actually pretty proud of it.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:08.940]   And if you like poop jokes and we're jokes, this is probably going to...
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:09.940]   This is our Magna Carta.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:12.980]   And this is going to start highest moment.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.660]   You will learn what it involved in making number three.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:16.900]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:21.620]   Lonely Sandwich and Scott Simpson from the paper company and Merlin Mann.
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:22.620]   So, must listen.
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.620]   You look nice today.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.620]   Nicely.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:25.620]   I appreciate it when you say that.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.620]   Thank you.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:27.620]   God, I love it.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:28.620]   It's hysterical.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:31.180]   Scott Borne, great to see you again.
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.340]   Please don't be a stranger.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:38.460]   We'll now that you've landed in Gig Haba for the winter or the summer or whatever season
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.460]   it is in Gig Haba these days, we'll get you on more often.
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:43.460]   ScottBorne.com.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:48.540]   He does so many other things, PhotoFocus.com and the iPad show with Andy and not Cohen and
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:49.540]   a lot more.
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:51.020]   But it's all at ScottBorne.com, right?
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:55.300]   You can find everything at ScottBorne.com, which is run thanks to Merlin Mann on Tumblr.
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:56.300]   Really?
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:57.300]   Cool, man.
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:58.300]   That's for you.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:48:59.300]   I didn't know that.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:02.060]   I'm going to have to follow you now.
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:07.460]   I took Merlin's advice to heart and I said, "Man, this is really a great idea and I've
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.020]   used it a long time and just love it."
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:10.020]   I'm following you there.
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:11.020]   I'm following you there.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.260]   I'm a lot of really nice people on Tumblr.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.260]   It's very cool.
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:15.260]   I love Tumblr.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.260]   I love it.
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.260]   Yep.
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:18.260]   In fact, that would be a good pick.
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:19.260]   Man, it is.
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.260]   It is a good pick.
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.700]   It is what I like about it is I could push all of my livestream to that right site.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:26.700]   It's all there.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:30.940]   So, Andy, I just wanted to point out in passing me NPR today is also the birthday of Frank
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:37.220]   Oz and I would say happy birthday for bringing me so much joy over the years.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.980]   I love that guy and I'm just very glad he was born today.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:41.900]   The voice of Yoda of Cookie Monster.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:42.900]   He's Cookie Monster.
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:43.900]   He's a piggy.
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:48.180]   I think in tribute, we should end this podcast by all demonstrating the difference between
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:55.180]   near and far.
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:59.980]   I, my problem is my kid, watch "Assessomie Street."
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:04.780]   Now, whenever you're Grover, all I hear is Yoda.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:07.580]   Yes, you will, Bill.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:08.780]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:09.780]   We'll see you next time.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:11.780]   Another Mac break is in the can.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:18.780]   There's something like that.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:22.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
