[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.360]   Highly we got flooded after Mac break weekly like so many people friended us that I think our system went down
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.920]   You said there was though. I never thought yeah, thanks everybody. I never you said there were max with 200 friends
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.640]   I thought yes, I'll never but I've got 200. I'm sorry. Yeah
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.760]   Thank you. They don't know that's the terrible thing is they don't know it just sounds like we're ignoring them
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.840]   Which I hate so we're not ignoring you. Yeah, we're just maxed
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.480]   Leo can I confess something it's 105 degrees and 60% humidity in Canada? Well in Montreal right now
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.560]   And I don't know what to do. I'm just sitting here melting. I don't get it. I don't get it
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.200]   It's either freezing and like you're snowed in
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.240]   You need to move somewhere more temperate. Yeah for imperialistic fans
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.320]   We're went from minus 30 to plus 30 in just like a month and a half
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   I don't get it
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.040]   Also with this Alex Lindsey who has moved somewhere more temperate here. Yes, although it looks like you got a little son
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.200]   My friend I've been taking advantage of the summer being nice. I vote yeah
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.960]   You should the Sun is good. It's just right here though. It's like the right farmer tan pale. Yeah. Yeah farmer tan
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.560]   Just my head just your head is to the window. I said by the window. Yeah, exactly
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.920]   Also with us from the New England area mr. Andy and not code I in
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.320]   n at co
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.960]   Correcting you 86 degrees. So so we're we're the we're the our frigid neighbors to the south
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.800]   For for my mom who's just up the road a piece from you said I can't FaceTime today. It's so hot
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.480]   I'm melting. That's true. Yeah, the devices get so hot
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920]   This is this is this is the first day that I have the the the
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.440]   Vornado like floor upwards upwards fan going because no, but I would I would not be glowing
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.160]   I would be perspiring and dripping under the keyboard causing all kind of distress. So just in case you're wondering
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.320]   It's a near-perfect 67 degrees here. I know it's right. Yeah
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.280]   It's tomorrow's Independence Day in the United States. Happy Canada Day by the way. Oh, thank you Sunday was
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.120]   Thank you today. Yeah, and then we follow with Independence Day on the fourth happy Independence Day July 1st
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.600]   For Rwanda and then we're on that they're celebrating also on Canada Day. It was the only month warm enough for all of us
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   I guess so
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.540]   What are you doing for Independence Day? We got some friends coming over. I'm just gonna sit around get a blow stuff up
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.720]   Because I I have heard your people like to blow things up. I don't I don't blow anything up anymore uncle uncle four finger Freddy
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.920]   Yeah, yeah, you know, it's illegal to have fireworks in Marin County. Oh, yeah, we can have a beer those signs everywhere like
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.160]   Every place they can put a sign that says oh and there's a huge area of dry grass right below my house
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.720]   I couldn't have a worse place to have no fire. What about Skywalker or rent? Don't they have lasers and blasters and lasers are okay?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.640]   Yeah, they only leave little marks though. Yeah, that's the whole thing. Yeah, Andy. What are you doing for the Independence Day for the fourth?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.840]   Uh, that was there's fireworks tonight. So I'm gonna be out there shooting that
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.760]   Uh, and then probably a diner breakfast tomorrow followed by
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.040]   Remembering a of a happier day in America. That's all a diner breakfast is a happy day anytime. Oh, yeah
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.600]   What does a diner breakfast include? I'm just starving. I'm designing
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.960]   Uh, there's there's a there's a special up the street that they it's pancakes with whipped cream. See got your with a strawberry
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.560]   So you got your red blueberries. So you got your blue and whipped cream. So you get your white
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.160]   So I'm gonna do so and be and because it's about an 8,000 calorie load
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.240]   On one deal that's the meal very very much god bless their independent cakes
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.960]   Freedom cakes
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.240]   Freedom red white and blue. Wow. That's awesome
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.280]   And probably once four hours after that once I've had my nap a trip to the beach because
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.240]   It's gonna be a good beach day. We're going
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.040]   Put it to be slippery. It is gonna be a good beach day. It's not too bad here, but we're it's even cooler where we're going up the coast of Mendocino
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.880]   It's gonna be like 59 degrees tomorrow. Where in Mendocino? Um
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.600]   The town
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.960]   Mendocino, okay. Okay. I think yeah, I'll tell I think it's a big place. Yeah, you're right. There's a big county
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.840]   Yeah
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.160]   Uh, but I'm gonna stay away from the marijuana forests and just stay in town
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.480]   Probably and I think
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.960]   I love for brag. Yeah, that's yeah
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   I used to be like we're carlady and I used to go over
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.200]   And this is just a little tiny town
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.080]   We're a stay in town. Yeah, it's gonna be fun. And hula la
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   He'll drive through.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   Wallala.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   Wallala.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   Wallala.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   Wallala.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.120]   Well, oh, la la it's got a G in it somewhere.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   But you don't say it.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.120]   It goes.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.000]   It's a Lake Okaboji like Okaboji Apple, according to Matthew
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.700]   Pandarino this felt a little bit like I'm gonna confess PR.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.320]   Play here.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.340]   Second big exclusive for Panzarino in a row Mac pro, and now maps yet way to go matte.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.960]   Yeah, he got invited among others to that special.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   We apologize.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Last time you were invited.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   You got invited.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   The update for the Mac Pro was just him.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.960]   Oh, the update was just him.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.560]   He wrote the article about how we brought in people, experts and creative types and they're
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   gonna be.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.960]   Now he's talking about rebuilding maps.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.600]   But I would say you want to be a little careful at this point, Matthew, because you're
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.960]   becoming a publicity flack for Apple.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   But it's weird because the verge, like in Dieterbone, get all the Google, like all the Android
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.980]   stuff the day before and CNET has some companies that always give it seems like it's breaking
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.660]   up until it's little.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.420]   Feef to little lifetimes.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.420]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.700]   However, lots of interesting information here.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.340]   Eddie Cue brought them up to the campus and they talked about what's gonna happen in
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.340]   maps.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.700]   And you know, not surprising that Apple has decided that they don't want to rely on Tom
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.140]   Tom and open map, open whatever is is maps.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.140]   Open street map.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.180]   Open street map to get their data data.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.760]   So they're collecting and have been collecting their own data.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.340]   Now they had a, they have to explain and they do in great detail here how they're getting
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.480]   data from you and where you go, but they're not getting data from your whole trip.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.960]   Just not, they're leaving out the beginning and the end.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.680]   And there's a little graphic.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.960]   And they take random segments from the, from the middle that are de-identified.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.200]   What they, what this graphic does not tell you is how big these segments are, but okay.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.560]   But Apple saying is we're trying to anonymize this data and yet still get the thing that
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.680]   Google has, which is so valuable, which is direct data from people driving the route.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.840]   The ways model.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.320]   But that, that's an interesting omission too, because one of the most valuable piece of
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.240]   information is where are the entrances and exits to a place.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.920]   So that could be a piece of data that they're missing depending on how they chant, they,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.560]   they anonymize or interpret.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.760]   We're not going to pay attention to the beginning or the end of your trip.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   That's actually an important point.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.240]   If you wanted to come to Twit, there's really only one place that makes any sense in this
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.000]   big, long building, because anywhere else you're going to go somewhere else.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And so.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.320]   They did address that though.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.440]   So the, they're, they're only using the segments as probe data for traffic flow, construction,
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.800]   accident, stuff like that.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.000]   All they want to know there is are you going on a roadway they don't currently have in
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   the system?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And are you having the detour for the, for what they're calling access points, they're
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.520]   using both the satellite imagery, but they're using those Apple Maps vans, which are making
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.440]   those super high def panoramas.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.320]   And then they're employing hundreds of human editors to go in there and look at them and
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.880]   find the act because there was like, like sometimes it's around the street, a panzerino
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.680]   was on the talk show with Gruber a couple of days ago as well.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.080]   And they expounded on a lot of this, but they're saying like sometimes the address is a glamour
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.120]   address because that's the street you want, but there's no door there.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.960]   And the actual address is around the corner and 500 feet down.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.480]   And they're using a combination of the vans, the high definition satellite imagery, the
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.640]   point clouds and then human editors to try to make sure that every one of those actual
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.400]   points of access are correct.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   And you'll be happy to know that would be fans use Apple gear.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.120]   He says, there's a surprising lack of bulky equipment inside.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.240]   Instead, a Mac Pro bolted to the floor.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.480]   That's where they went.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.280]   That's where they are.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.720]   Attached to an array of solid state drives, a single USB cable goes up to the dashboard
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.760]   where the actual mapping capture software runs on a iPad.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.160]   Wow.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   I wouldn't.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160]   It's a picture of it too.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   It looked pretty dope.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.480]   It'd be hard to have a press tour if you had Linux boxes running in there.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.360]   Here's the iPad with the mapping data and the single USB cable.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.120]   I think that one of the things that we've been talking a lot about is the fact that
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.800]   when we talk about net neutrality and so on and so forth, one of the things that's
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.920]   going to be really important is location services.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.840]   And Apple and Google are pretty much closing that up.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.320]   There's not going to be one of the things that I think that cities need to start thinking
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.400]   about is that something that they should be gathering, that data, and then licensing
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.560]   back to developers so that you can have an enormous amount of data as a developer that
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.920]   isn't Apple or Google.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.720]   I have qualms about this.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.800]   Cities do this right now with mass transit, right?
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.360]   And they try to make money on it.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.680]   In fact, they sometimes don't give it to third parties but still try to sell their own mass
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.080]   transit apps.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.280]   And I feel like that's the city.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   It's terrible, usually.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   Which are terrible.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.680]   I feel like that should be if anything is open source data.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.320]   Yes, the city should gather.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.480]   The promise is that it's extremely expensive to gather it.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   It's expensive to gather.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   They should maintain it.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.960]   So you're monetized, obviously.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.720]   I think that they shouldn't try to build their own apps.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   I think that what they need to do is build a common framework that allows other people
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.240]   to use them at a relatively inexpensive, and that relatively inexpensive could be differing.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.480]   For instance, if you did something, let's say, at the Muscogee Center and you, say,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.800]   mapped out the entire thing with all the data that you needed, you could probably charge
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.640]   every company that comes in there $25,000 for the license for this year to use it.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.400]   Because the amount I would save them would be, they can't do it.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.240]   It's like it would be impossible for them to execute.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.120]   Because the hardest part about this is not only gathering that data but maintaining it.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.520]   And so you do want to pay for it.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.400]   You need to figure out what the reasonable number is.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.440]   But you don't want it to be another government service that doesn't have a fiscal, you know,
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   connection.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.440]   I guess that's true.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   Otherwise, you're going to pay for it in taxes.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   I guess that's true.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   You want it.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   We're already paying for it if you ask me in taxes.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   Well, not a few.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.840]   I mean, there are definitely parts of cities that are not being paid for by the taxpayers.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   They're being paid for.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.200]   Like when you talk about zoning and talk about a lot of those things, those departments are
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   being paid for by your fees.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   You know, like if you're doing that.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   And that's the way it should be.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.960]   Well, that's a fee is a tax.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   Well, it is.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   But I mean, it's a fee.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.440]   But it's not a general tax point across everything.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.720]   It is for the people who are using it.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.160]   And if the city is doing road work, they have that information.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   They're collecting that information.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.360]   Well, they're collecting an enormous amount of information.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.400]   You know, super interesting to me in all this is that Google, there used to be two mapping
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   companies.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.080]   There was Navtech and there was Tella Atlas.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.440]   Tella Atlas became Tom Tom and Navtech was Nokia here.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.360]   And then it got sold to a bunch of car companies.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.840]   But Google used to license their data.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.240]   Then they redrove the world and made a better Google Maps.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.120]   And Apple used to license their data.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.320]   And now they're redriving the world trying to make a better mapping solution for them
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.160]   better means more private.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.400]   Amazon, no doubt, maps a lot of stuff.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.800]   Facebook hired the guy who used to run Apple Maps years ago.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.720]   And they have so much user location information.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.640]   And we still haven't seen any products from them.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   Right.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.520]   Well, just to point out how long and arduous this process is, Apple will put this information
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.000]   into maps starting in the fall with iOS 12.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   And it will cover all of San Francisco and the Bay Area.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   It started today.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.760]   It started rolling on San Francisco this morning.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.080]   I know they're on the Bay of California by fall.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.600]   So at that rate, it's going to take them a little while to get the world.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.720]   All of the US in within one year they said.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   Which is still a simple place.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.840]   But that also points out the global problem of this.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:27.680]   There are a lot of cities and even countries where you just can't, the roads aren't necessarily
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   drivable.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.000]   The government is not necessarily keeping a database of their own.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.040]   And so you really do have to algorithmically figure out by flow of people, by satellite
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.960]   imagery, by 3D imagery, calculate where streets actually are.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.440]   So that's why you, that's, that's the difference between the big two or even the big one, let's
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.520]   say Google Maps and the other ones are trying to catch up when you go to these very, very
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.120]   rural areas where every single tiny 800 year old, 500 year old, 400 year old street is actually
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.520]   mapped out versus a bit being a complete dead zone.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.240]   All you see is the street that was, that was actually paved 30 years ago on other map systems.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.880]   So it's, it's a non trivial problem.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.520]   When, whenever I see a lot of people writing about how, how like Google or other companies
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.720]   should be broken up and they should be able to share maps, there's a, there's a, there's
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.880]   a problem where Google and these, and another company might have the, the majority of all
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.280]   the, of all the map services.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.720]   Well, that's because mapping is really, really hard and really, really expensive as going
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   to take you a decade.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   You, you have to start like the best time to start a mapping service is about 15 years
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   ago.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.240]   And if you haven't, well, there's not much you can do.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.160]   And, and in a lot of the countries, especially in smaller cities, it is a, I was talking to
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.880]   someone who actually contracts some of this and it's a boom for the people who got into
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   it.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   Like Eastern Europe, these guys are, you know, they, they have little location data and,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.960]   and so on and so forth.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.720]   And, um, you know, these guys are making, you suddenly were, they were doing like little
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.440]   bits and bobs and Eastern Europe and suddenly they're making millions.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.840]   Cause, you know, cause someone, you know, be, some of these big companies, not necessarily
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.360]   Apple and Google, but other companies that all want mapping data and they sell it to
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.200]   each one of them at a, at, you know, it's the same data that they just keep on parsley
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   now and selling to different people.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.640]   It's not a, it's a lifetime commitment because, uh, it's like painting the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   You never done it.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   Yep.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   You gotta keep doing it.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.880]   So Apple's essentially saying this is a high priority for them.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.960]   There's another piece to this puzzle.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.120]   If you're going to do anything with self-driving cars, you have to have good maps, right?
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.640]   And augmented reality and what they're doing that's so interesting is they're not just
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.120]   making panoramas because everybody says we want street view and they are doing the panoramas
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.440]   for street view, but they're taking point clouds, which are three dimensional measurements
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.160]   of everything in the surrounding 360 degrees and up.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.240]   Um, and that means you could build an autonomous technology because it would have, it's like
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   pre-fetching data.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.000]   You don't want to, you, you fizzled, you cannot, at least with our current computing capacity,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.280]   you cannot do everything live and everything in real time.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.520]   You have to have a huge amount of pre-fetch data, but also if you want to start layering
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   augmentation and enhancements on the real world, you need to know as much about that
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.760]   world as possible.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.080]   And a huge part of AR is ingesting the world around you and they're, they're loading all
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.160]   this up that goes into those max, goes into the SDs, goes to the server center.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   They de-anonymize it.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.440]   So they anonymize it so there's no faces or licenses and then they start building these
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.600]   models for everything.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.080]   Well, and that, and they're using, um, typically they're using flash, uh, LiDAR for a lot of
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   that.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.880]   They look like little circles that are on the corners and that's a, those are Velodyne is
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.960]   probably the company that suddenly made a lot of money doing this for the car, both
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.480]   the cars and the gathering.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.320]   Um, that data, you know, what, a lot of what they're doing there is also like really making
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.640]   sure they know exactly where you are.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.280]   So the, the GPS gets you plus or minus 10 meters or, or, you know, it can get a little
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.480]   bit better than that, but what, you know, and a lot of other things will help you tighten
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   it.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.920]   But what, by then using basically a hash diversion of the image recognition of the 3D information,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.960]   they're not using all the information because that'd be too heavy, but a hashed version
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.840]   of it, they can quickly figure out precisely down to the, you know, millimeters of where,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.560]   where your vehicle is, which is obviously important for them to figure it out.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.960]   People will argue that you don't necessarily to drive, you don't necessarily need, um,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.720]   that data, that AR data, um, because it, it's just reacting to what's around it, but to
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.520]   know where it's going or nowhere to go, you know, to know where to go next.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.600]   It needs to have, um, you know, all that data, but it's the, the actual driving component
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.360]   is partially connected to what it thinks should happen, but it's also very connected to it
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.160]   responding or not responding in the case of Arizona case, um, to the, uh, to the data
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160]   that's coming, coming to it.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.040]   Renee, how would you know if your maps were updated?
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:33.280]   I mean, I, I'm opening my, I'm using iOS 12, by the way, and we'll get to this in a second.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.080]   Uh, I want, I want to put a kind of a stop sign on people who are starting to install
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.640]   the public beta and we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.680]   Uh, of either iOS, 12 or Mojave, but how would I know if I have iOS 12?
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.800]   I'm in the Bay Area.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.080]   How would I know that now it's using its own data?
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:56.360]   It still says Tom, Tom, and other data providers, uh, in the copyright information.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.120]   We lost Renee briefly.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.200]   There's a, there's a, it's going to continue to as well.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.960]   I mean, it's, it's not going to, uh, it's not going to go away.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.280]   Oh, no, no, they're going to continue to license all of this.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.280]   They're going to continue.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   I don't think any, but they're not even, I don't think they're even licensed in any
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.400]   less than anyone else.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.840]   They're simply adding all of these other services on top of, of what they, uh,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   Reno says something.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.280]   I'm not sure is quite true.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.840]   He says that the only company that owns the entire map stack is Google.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.080]   Apple wants to be the other one is really, is it only Google that owns the map stack
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   from the ground up?
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.480]   Aren't other companies, isn't, uh, isn't, isn't Mercedes Benz and, and Audi and the,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.680]   you're not, not that they're not doing this kind of mapping.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.560]   Not at the level of detail that we're talking about where you know everything about what's
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   there.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:46.120]   I mean, for the driving, for the cars, they, again, they, they need their, it's, they
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   are very dependent on the moment, you know, being able to scan the moment and understand
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.640]   what's going on in that moment.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.560]   They need some of the map data to get around, but it's not a, um, uh, so that, that's where
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.000]   a lot of cars have cars driving around that they could presumably get map data from.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.640]   Well, theoretically, if you had enough cars using enough self-driving cars, you'll, your
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.400]   maps will get better over time.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   Right.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.320]   You know, so that all those cars, you know, a Google process of this will be that when
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.520]   Waymo has, you know, 50,000 cars out there, they're going to not only be driving around,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.720]   but they're going to be continually mapping and remapping and resolu-
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.360]   Yeah, I wonder if you're just doing that.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.920]   I'm sure that a lot of them are thinking about it.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.000]   I don't know if they're, you know, it's, but, but I, but a lot of them are going to
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.080]   continue to use the LiDAR data that they're using to drive to continue to resolve the,
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.400]   the areas that we were driving in.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.240]   It's, but, and they'll, you can't do that until they're out there.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   Right.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.320]   So there's a hell of a lot of data in all the captures they're doing.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.360]   Google is making sure that they're capturing also street signs so that they know what the
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   traffic laws are.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   They're capturing where the public utility services are.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.840]   They're, they are, as far as I know, as of a couple of years ago, they're capturing
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.360]   that data to actually derive a point cloud from where they're going from the areas they're
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.840]   going through, which is one of the reasons why when you go to 3D view and maps, it's
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.360]   just such a detailed, detailed thing because they've been collecting that forever and
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   ever and ever.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.640]   So it's, it's, like I said, it's a hard, hard thing to do.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:15.280]   There was, I was, I still remember talking to, talking to one, one provider that said
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.840]   that we have to, we have to send cars to every single hospital so that we know exactly where
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.800]   the emergency remittances as opposed to where the parking structure is because we have to
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   understand the context of why are they asking us, whereas the, whereas the nearest hospital,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.880]   if they're saying, if they're saying, if they're essentially saying we're visiting a friend,
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.640]   we need to make sure we guide them to the parking structure, but if there's an emergency,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.280]   we have to make sure we get them exactly to the emergency remittances.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.280]   So that's why we have to do it.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   So that's why we have to do it.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   Data, data, data, data.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.720]   There are a few, few companies that have the scope to do this properly and Google started
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   doing this 10 years ago.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.080]   And I think that we're fortunate that Apple decided to get into the, into the mix because
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.920]   Google, Google's been doing a great job.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.760]   But the arms raised between them is going to forever.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   I agree with you.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   100%.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.960]   We know if they're going to use the duplex technology for like traffic yelling.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   You can't walk here.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   That's awesome.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   That'd be fantastic.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   And Alex is right.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   Cause it's not just Apple and Google competing to get the click the best data, but the companies
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   that created, create the LiDARs and create those sensors.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.560]   Now there are multiple, multiple multiple people who are buying this, that equipment
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.040]   that is also spurring them to have the best, the most accurate detail, the highest refresh
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:33.320]   rate, the lowest profile on the vehicle to such an extent where at some point, you could,
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.240]   you could actually foresee a future in which there, you know, how, how recently they've
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.400]   they've legislated that every new car has to have a backup camera now.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.360]   We would have been a most ridiculous and wonderful, wonderful feature for luxury cars
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   five or 10 years ago.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.840]   Now it's going to stick to be a standard feature.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:56.360]   They could get the LiDAR so small that essentially every car traveling is also remapping its
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.200]   environment and contributing that to a public database.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.960]   That could happen in the next five or 10 years because of how the, there's no longer the,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.800]   there's no longer, you know, a station wagon with essentially the robot from lost in space
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.360]   bolted to the top of it.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.560]   Now it's actually maybe you think that this person has a roof rack for a kayak, but no
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.520]   kayak on it, but actually it's a very, very sophisticated data collection device.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.280]   That's how Apple said they wanted to remove cognitive load by doing all this because they
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   wanted to make sure it's absolutely, you never have to worry which lane to be in.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.680]   They want it, they're doing things like matching the typography and design of the street signs
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.240]   on a city by city basis.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.040]   You'll just recognize your local street signs and not like everything they possibly can
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.120]   do to make the driving experience the least stressful possible.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.920]   That's where Apple really excels, right?
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.720]   So I was asking Renee before we lost you, how do you do the new Skype?
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.000]   Well, you're like, as I was talking, it shut down and updated to the new Skype.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.920]   Oh, don't get me started on Skype.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.560]   One of the things you'll note in the new Skype is they apparently have taken out game control
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.560]   of any kind.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.600]   Yeah, I believe it's an electron app.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   Let's Skype to it.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.000]   Yeah, it is an electron app.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.440]   Yeah, among other problems.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.320]   So I was asking how you said you have the new map data in the beta, the iOS beta, how
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   do you know that?
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   I don't see it anywhere.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.680]   So, well, I was looking at Reddit and they started getting really excited as it started
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.080]   rolling out in San Francisco.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.400]   So it was with everything in San Francisco and check red.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.040]   And now I like it.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.400]   We'll see and it should reach the Bay Area within this week.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.520]   This is one of the things I love about Reddit is there's always somebody who's like,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.120]   the most avid fanatic of all who can figure this out.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.320]   It's crowd sourcing and the ultimate.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.440]   All right, so that's good to know.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.840]   But again, it's going to take a while before it comes to a city near you.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.640]   I mean, the demo pictures that Panzer had were all four bags.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.360]   Maybe you'll see them over the early fourth.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.720]   That's where I'm going for the fourth.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   I didn't notice that.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.280]   There's one in Cupertino.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   Cupertino demo.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.040]   Let's scroll up here.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.080]   And that's that's the old map.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.280]   That's the old stuff.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   A little bit further down.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.280]   Yeah, I see.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.000]   And it should be a side by side comparison as well.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.200]   Okay, that's Cupertino also.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.760]   Oh, here you go.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.920]   And Fort Bragg.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   Fort Bragg.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.440]   Well, that's where I'm going to see the fireworks right there.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   And the dog.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.280]   And Google has always had all these trails and all these the forest and everything that
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   and Apple hasn't.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.360]   So now Apple's finally getting all that stuff integrated.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.760]   We're going to if you want to come visit, we're going to be a glass beach for the fireworks.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.920]   Look for look, we got a tent.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   Oh, cool.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.880]   That's really cool.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.080]   So yeah, you know, I think Alex made the exactly right point, which is we should encourage
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.480]   this because the competition is good for everybody.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   We'll get better maps.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   We'll get better choices.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.480]   I use Apple maps.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   It's good options.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.080]   Yeah, because like some people don't like ways because they don't like the idea of sharing
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   their location.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.720]   And if they have an alternative and maybe it's not as good as ways, but maybe it's private
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.040]   and that means more to them than the, you know, it's nice to have different options
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.200]   and different business models and different providers and all the different things that
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   go into it.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.120]   Is it always going to, I think it is always going to be the case that private means a
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.240]   little bit less complete?
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.320]   Well, I think the question is, when does it get to a point where the difference is minute?
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.000]   I mean, Apple has the money to spend where they can get to the point where, you know,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.400]   is 95 or 90% as good, good enough to make it to a point where you're just getting your
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   privacy in the back.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.800]   It's less, but it's longer.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.400]   Also, we don't, we don't want to get lulled into the thing.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.800]   We're just culturally, we simply accept that the only way to get the best possible results
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.120]   is to give up some of our privacy.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.480]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   That's a danger.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.640]   We have to make sure that we always have the ability to, when you borrow someone's iPhone,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.960]   you realize, "Oh, well, actually, this navigation app got me there just fine."
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.240]   And didn't they keep hammering on at Apple about how they're not putting any personal
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   data?
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   Oh, you know, it's less convenient.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.800]   That also puts, that also puts pressure on Google and other makers to put the accent
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.200]   on privacy whenever they can.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   And it's less convenient to get into your house when there's a lock, but it's still
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   useful.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.240]   I don't know if you saw the email story yesterday about the companies that were just reading
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.280]   people's emails who signed up for their services.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   But you've already talked about that kind of stuff.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   We talked about that.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.640]   I have to say that is a very typical Wall Street Journal hit piece.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.560]   Wall Street Journal has, there's no love lost for Google at all.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.440]   And they, they, they, well, that wasn't Google though.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.120]   That was the Yahoo and it was any, any free mail account that you signed up.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.800]   Yeah, but it was like a bogus piece to me because if you sign up for something to read
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.520]   your email, you can't really be surprised that it's reading your email.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   I think so.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.160]   I agree with you completely, but I think there's always a difference.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.720]   It's like when we found out that Uber was like monitoring celebrities or that the NSA
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.160]   was like, look, like trying to stalk their ex-girlfriends.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.920]   It's like do your job, but don't ever go beyond this copier job.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.040]   Well, I don't, I think despite all of this, it, you know, it would attempt to with, you
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.640]   know, scary hackers in dark closets looking at your email.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.400]   That's not what they're asserting.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   They're just saying, look at these programs.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.500]   If you, you know, if you have, look, okay, maybe, okay, little, little alert to everybody.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.520]   If you have an anti spam feature, it has to look at your email.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.320]   If you have a suggested reply, it has to look at your email.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.840]   Google in June of last year said we're not going to look at email for ads anymore, but
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.360]   they still look at your email.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:12.680]   If you sign up for a service that looks for receipts to see if you overpaid for something,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.480]   it's reading your email.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480]   Obviously right now.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   But you've only got a little trouble.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:22.000]   Yeah, I mean, and I think that Google is policing this and has absolutely, and needs
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.760]   to continue to police it to make sure that companies don't overstep their bounds.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.000]   But you're basically giving permission to read all of your email.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.480]   Why would you be surprised that it's reading all of your email?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.880]   Because we're expecting that it's going to read our email within the limits of features
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.720]   that are going to help us personally that this is, we feel as though this is the deal
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.280]   that we signed when we click through that agreement that we never actually read.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.720]   It's when we find out that actually you're letting your letting every person who uses
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.240]   this API also get a list of my friends and then use that for any purpose that they want,
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.480]   that we feel as though we should have been informed about this.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.320]   We feel like we're being kind of roped.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.640]   And if this happens too much with a certain company, we start to feel as though Facebook,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.400]   oh wait, did I say a specific name?
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.360]   Oh, wait, that was too old to say.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.480]   Maybe this company really doesn't care about this and maybe I should start to limit my
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.080]   associations with this company.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   Right.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.600]   Yeah, it's when it's programmatic, it's not a problem.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.880]   When people can just randomly do it for jokes and chuckles, I think we can accept.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.560]   Well, and that's the other, I mean they kind of imply that that's what's happening.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   But in the two cases that they refer to, human teams were hired to train the computers because
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.680]   the computers weren't doing a very good job of determining what was personal and what was
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   not.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.480]   I don't find that problematic either.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.960]   Yeah, I guess you should.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.360]   I mean, it's worth alerting people, but I feel like this was the Wall Street Journal
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.760]   saying, I mean, what was the headline?
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.480]   It was something really incendiary.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.440]   I don't have it in front of me, but it just, I feel like this is the journal and perhaps
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   overblown.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.440]   It's the same thing with security.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.160]   This is the inform, but don't be, don't be, don't have your attention stolen through
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   sensationalism.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.080]   But this, but this is also something that is part of the education process that we need
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.800]   to take part in, particularly with machine learning, machine learning a component of
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.000]   it is, is learning.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.280]   You have to keep exposing this, this system to data, data, data, data, and part of the
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.520]   learning process is every time that the machine learning model screws up, it usually gets kicked
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.840]   back to a human being who looks at that data and points out, okay, this is right.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   This is wrong.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.520]   A, to give the result that the user wants, but also to teach the model that this was,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.280]   this is what you should have done in this situation.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:31.920]   I would be less bothered by this if it wasn't a continued problem with Wall Street Journal
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.720]   stories about Google Parallax text, dirty secrets, the app developers sifting through
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.920]   your Gmail software developers scan hundreds of millions of emails of users who sign up
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.440]   for email based services.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.920]   Well, I was just shocked they didn't get Apple in the title, frankly.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:55.120]   I mean, you know, the headlines like this are what keep Renee and I understand.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.720]   The internet, but the internet giant Google continues to let hundreds of outside software
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.200]   developers scan the inboxes of millions of Gmail users who signed up for email based
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   services.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   No, I'm dumb, dumb.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   Okay.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   I just be informed.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   I'm just being informed.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:23.360]   But like, yeah, it doesn't mean you have to read in great detail the privacy agreement.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.920]   It wouldn't be a bad thing, but you don't have to.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.040]   If you if you sign up for something that says we're going to look at your email, like
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   I use trip it.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.520]   Everything I use for this is trip it because a trip and actually I stopped using Gmail
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.720]   as my main email for other other reasons.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.040]   So trip it.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.320]   Now I actually have to explicitly email stuff to them if I want them to travel plans.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.720]   And so I know, you know, that's fine.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.920]   I immediately as soon as I read about unroll me, signing reading other stuff and sending
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:56.440]   it to to Uber, I agree that was that was over overstating, you know, over over.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.800]   I was doing a bad thing.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's like un unenrolled and roll me.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.120]   But you know, it's like we've been swept with like we've said often.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.680]   It's all about the transaction.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.200]   I feel like I've I've always understood what the transaction is.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.640]   For instance, with Gmail, which is why that I use it.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.360]   I have Gmail addresses for certain very functional practices.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.720]   But when it comes to my actual work, things that are personal, things that are work related,
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.880]   things that are real for black, a better word, I don't use Gmail for that.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.400]   I never have and never would.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.360]   So it's a server that actually controlled that I can trust a little bit better.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   Right.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:38.320]   And if you any, you know, Microsoft used to do those ads with Gmail man, a human reading
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.640]   your email, which was I found very offensive.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.160]   And they, but of course they have to do the same thing because any company that offers
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.800]   any spam protection in an email service is reading your email.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.520]   All right, let's talk about the betas because I know a lot of people are probably very tempted
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.240]   by the public betas of iOS 12 and Mojave and TVOS.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:07.360]   I tried to put Mojave on my iMac Pro and the install for whatever reason, froze, giving
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.960]   no forcing me to reinstall high Sierra on my iMac Pro.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.400]   I learned my lesson.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.800]   I don't think that's why I don't think that's why it's spread, but it's just that's that's
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.480]   what we keep saying is that you shouldn't do this on a production machine.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:28.760]   iOS 12 is one of the problems I've had with iOS 12 is that feature that keeps an eye on
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.640]   how, you know, your screen time.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.640]   Yes.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   I had screen time turned on.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.440]   Not that it not not the downtime is what I'm talking about.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.680]   I had downtime turned on set a schedule for time away from the screen during downtime.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.160]   Only apps you choose to allow and phone calls will be available.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.720]   And I found there was a significant delay when I was turn it when downtime was being
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:55.000]   turned off programmatically at 9 a.m. that my whole iPhone was unusable for about 30 seconds
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   or minute.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.680]   I had a different problem in that I couldn't turn it off.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.000]   It was just always on and it turns out that because I set the password on my iPad, even
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.480]   though it made it look like I could turn it off on other devices, I could.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.000]   I had to remember to go back to my iPad and turn it off.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.440]   So these will all be ironed out, of course, by the time they release this in the fall,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.960]   but just it's a word of warning.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.760]   By the time 12.4 comes out, Leo, it'll be so smooth.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.600]   But if you're in the public beta, you don't get all of those updates, right?
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   Well, you'll get it.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.360]   It's usually a couple of days later in the week and it'll be called public beta three
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.560]   because they're generally a beta behind the developers.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.120]   It doesn't say when I'm looking at software updates, it doesn't say anything but iOS 12.0.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.800]   Yeah, if you look at your about, it'll give you the build.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   So I'm running.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   Oh, ah, there you go.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.440]   Go to the about.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   About general.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   Sorry, general about.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.160]   Then I am running with.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.480]   I'm running beta three, the one from today.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.120]   And at 16 a 5318 D.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.040]   Oh, where would I find that?
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   There's a problem version.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.080]   16 a five, three five, three, three, oh, a is that the same one?
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.000]   That's a you know, the public beta or the developer beta?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.800]   I'm on the public beta five, three, eight, five, three, zero, eight, E.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.880]   Different one.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.880]   OK.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.040]   I'm on one eight.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   One eight.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.800]   Ten, you're ten later.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.960]   Did you notice they changed all the code names this year?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   Oh.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.800]   They used to follow patterns like iOS was always ski hills and watch OS was beaches
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.040]   and Mac OS was apples for the last few years before that it was wines.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.800]   And now iOS is peace.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.640]   Mac OS is Liberty.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.080]   Watch OS is glory and TVOS is hope.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.080]   Very patriotic.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   Making a go under three years.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.560]   Apple is great again.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560]   Apple is great.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.760]   God help us if next year the code names are make America great and again.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.400]   I think I wonder if there's a little bit too close to my house.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.440]   Instead of themes for every OS, I wonder if they're doing themes for every year now.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.160]   Oh, interesting, interesting.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.040]   Paul, you have a good article on the public beta at imore.com on Mojave.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.520]   Is it fairly?
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   Is it was my experience?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.520]   Lori Gil wrote it.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.760]   Is it my experience unusual or?
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.400]   Yeah, I've put it on three machines and it was fine on all of them.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.800]   I put it on the iMac Pro and I put it on a MacBook Pro and a MacBook and it's working.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   I wonder.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.880]   I have a lot of drives hanging off of the iMac Pro, including a Drobo.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   I wonder if some of that.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.120]   I know when I do updates, I disconnect everything.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.440]   I should disconnect all the USB stuff.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.480]   I think that's probably that's my gut feeling about that.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.120]   I had a scare with watch OS.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.000]   I never finished installing and then I rebooted it and it's been fine.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   So I'm just.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   How did you get?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Oh, you're a developer.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Developers can you watch OS?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.800]   Yeah, I'm excited about watch OS.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.160]   Is Waki Talkie on your watch now?
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.440]   Yes, yes.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.760]   I was Waki talking with Shenerty Caldwell the other day.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.240]   Oh, how does it work?
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   It's very sweet.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   It's like push to talk.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.720]   You press the button, you say what you're going to say and then they get it and then
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.560]   they push the button and say what they want to say.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.240]   It's like Waki Talkie or that Sprint Next Tell stuff they used to do on TV.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   Right, right.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.440]   Is it live or is it sending a file?
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.560]   It's basically uses FaceTime.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.680]   So basically as you speak, it opens up a FaceTime session between you, encrypts the audio, sends
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.520]   it to the source, de-incrypts it, plays it and then you can respond or.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   Oh, interesting.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   Breaking on.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   Oh, interesting.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   All right.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.280]   So you're in the world.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.760]   As far as long as you're both connected to the internet, it should work anywhere.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   And it's not but it's not like a party line.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   It's just point to point, right?
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   Yeah, point one.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.200]   Can you only have one person or can you have other people?
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   It's only one to one.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.560]   You can have as many people as you want, but going to talk to one to one at a time.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.760]   You can't use it for like Disney family trips yet.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.760]   Right.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:46.440]   But if you walkie-talkie serenity, could you then walkie-talkie somebody else?
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   Not at the same time.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   I could do it serially, but not.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.040]   No, I know it wouldn't be simultaneous, but could you then say, "Okay, now walkie-talkie
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.040]   Leo."
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.280]   I flip to a new car, walkie-talkie Leo, flip back to Srenity, walkie-talkie-spenity.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   Okay, that's good.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.040]   Then Leo will be asking questions for Srenity and you'll be like, "Wait, wait."
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   Might be confusing.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.040]   And then you go back and ask, "Is Srenity out?"
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.000]   A bunch of asynchronous conversations.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   How does it...
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.800]   Do you just hear the voice just comes in without you asking for it or...
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   You set yourself on.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   You have to set your status to available and then you can receive these things and it'll
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.080]   say Srenity is connecting and you can say, "Always or this time."
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   Does it do...
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   Before it starts talking and...
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   Now it turned off.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.440]   Well, I don't know if it does or not.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   I have to find out.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.480]   That was the most annoying thing about the next Delphon.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   It's next Delphon.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.280]   And you'd hear people like, you know, a block away.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   That was the worst part of the event.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.520]   We'd work at events, big events at large conference centers and they would just hand
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.200]   out hundreds of these things.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.800]   And I have to apologize to everybody listening to the show.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.040]   I just ruined your day.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   So, that's the best.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.560]   Well, the first time I was not timid about explaining it in no indirect terms to somebody
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.960]   what the quiet car on Amtrak is for.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.640]   You can't use your cell phone.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.920]   You gosh darn cannot use a push to talk that keeps making burping noises.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.400]   I could see using this with Lisa, my wife.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.520]   But of course she doesn't wear an Apple watch, so I won't.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   Kind of when we talk about augmented...
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   Not yet.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.160]   I was really thinking about it after the last show.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.480]   I was really thinking about the fact that when we think about augmented reality, the
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.680]   thing that's probably going to get augmented faster is going to be our ears.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.680]   Yes.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   Yep.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   You know, where we're going to be...
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.720]   I think we're not very far away with some of us starting to have putting basically hearing
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.280]   aids "into our ears and leaving them there all day."
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.000]   And really, something loud comes by, it blocks it.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   If we want to hear a little bit more, it'll extenuate it.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.160]   But also, it's just like a general...
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.040]   We're in communication with whoever we want to be in communication with.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040]   We're getting information.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   We're getting...
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040]   You have that...
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.040]   Your assistant is in your ears like we look at her.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.640]   No, when you think about it with augmented reality, when your pop pops up and it goes,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.840]   "When you look at this person," it goes, "That's Sam."
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   Hi, Sam.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   He's got three kids.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.040]   He wants to eat her like a little extra.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.720]   Alex, why are you reading my fake Facebook profile to me?
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   Oh, no reason.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.960]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.040]   Since we've seen a couple of different companies that are like...
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:19.520]   They're in Google I/O, one of the most interesting parts of the accessibility talk that they
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.520]   gave...
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.520]   I think it was on Thursday or something.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.680]   Just the idea of here is just a landier case to wear around your neck so that the phone
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.120]   camera...
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.880]   You're wearing your phone around your neck and the camera's side is out.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.720]   It's really giving you descriptive text to what is actually around you based on what
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.120]   it's seeing through the camera lens.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.360]   If you combine this with, let's say, a camera with the name of the product, but Motorola
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.880]   had a really good single Bluetooth earpiece that was almost...
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:56.320]   It wasn't like a hearing aid, but it was almost invisible and it also had a tap portion to
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   it.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.160]   You can actually just tap and then talk to Google Assistant to get answers and make
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.520]   things happen and would actually, of course, give you things inside your ear.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.280]   Imagine those two connected to each other and being able to say that the camera identifies
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.120]   a person ahead of you and then the earpiece simply whispers that name in your ear or you're
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.000]   walking along and you don't necessarily have to be holding up a phone to get the augmented
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.800]   reality, but because the data is coming in from the camera, your earpiece can say, "Turn
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   left."
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.000]   You see a Starbucks up ahead?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.200]   Well, the street is right past that Starbucks on the left.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.760]   Also, it is kind of comfortable.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:36.040]   I watch how comfortable my kids are with Alexa.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.320]   The thing that's interesting is that they're constantly just asking questions.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.040]   They'll always say, "If something comes up and they're talking about something like,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.720]   how far is this?" they'll just say the word and ask the question and move forward.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.120]   I think that that's just a, they're so comfortable with it.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   I can imagine, again, just having this all the time, but what's the temperature outside
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.680]   or is it going to rain today?
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.640]   Just having this kind of, rather than this lift my watch or go to my phone or whatever,
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   you're just constantly in this kind of conversation.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.720]   One of the next generation of Echo/Series/Google Assistant.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.200]   One of the cool things with the AirPods, they now support, I think with the beta, they now
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.720]   support Yoshlomo without you having to touch them first.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.280]   You can just talk to them.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.720]   There was this awesome app at WWDC.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   I'm blanking on the name.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   The guy made an app.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.440]   Originally, it was just for a guided running, but it's been used by the accessibility community
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.440]   now.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.640]   People who haven't been able to jog or to walk outside in years are now putting in AirPods,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   firing up this S app.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   I think it runs on the watch.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.320]   You don't have to have a phone with you.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   It just tells them, "Turn left here.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   Turn right here.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   Go down here.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Go there."
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.040]   They're out running and walking and having a blast.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.440]   That's an entirely an augmented reality experience.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.360]   I have and I haven't done the review yet.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:48.560]   These things called IQBuds, which is a new kind of earbud, but designed really to replace
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.520]   hearing aids.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:55.040]   You put it in your ear and it does an audiometric hearing assessment, calibrates it to your hearing
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.360]   profile.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.480]   Then it has an iPhone app.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   Then you can wear it.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:07.120]   You can hear better, but you can also, it has Siri and Google Assistant built in.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.960]   It's very, we're getting very close.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:18.940]   I have from Jabra, they make some Jabra Elite Sportbuds that have VO2 Max, they have heart
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:19.940]   rate.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.680]   I can't remember if they have blood pressure, but they have a lot of metrics that they get.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.880]   What we're not seeing is one device that does that all, but at some point we're going
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   to see that.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.200]   If you look at the patents at Apple's, I mean, Apple's looking about it pretty hard.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:39.120]   My glasses the ear, the watch, the AirBuds or AirPods have transformed my workout because
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.560]   somewhere in my garage is my phone.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.400]   I just think somewhere there and you're just wandering around and working out and it's
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:52.800]   just this, that disconnection of it and that whole process.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.520]   That's the only place I have a good preview of it because the only place I have my headphones
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.360]   on all the time except when I'm, that's the only time I'm really listening to them.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.760]   These new buds, by the way, which is interesting claim a 20 hour battery life.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.720]   Well, that's the big thing that has to change.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.920]   That's the thing that's going to make the difference is when you can leave them in.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   That's all day.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.000]   Of course, we're going to find out that they cause cancer and cancer.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.560]   Cancer schmancer, at least I'll be able to hear what's going on.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.000]   It's not any worse than the, than the corn.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.680]   They also claim high fidelity audio.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.880]   So that's one thing you don't get with hearing aids.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.360]   Hearing aids amplify the human voice, but they don't improve your hearing of anything
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   outside of that.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360]   Well, it's funny.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.960]   They amplify certain people's hearing.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.400]   You know, like I, I, I, I have a screechy voice, man.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   It's loud.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.880]   Well, when my grandmother, when my grandmother was 94, she had her hearing aids.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880]   She could hear me perfectly.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880]   Like I just have a conversation.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.880]   Everyone's like, oh, you got to really speak up.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.240]   And I was like, I don't know what you're talking about, but it just turned out my voice
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.040]   happens to be my frequency was like what it picked up.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   So she could hear me perfectly.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.520]   And then my, my, my sister would come in and she couldn't understand anything.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   It was like this.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:59.000]   One of the, one of the funnest and freakiest nights I've ever had was, remember, remember
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.760]   Studs Circle, the wonderful, like, oh, he's lighter studs.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.760]   Circle.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   Okay.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.400]   So, so, so, um, I just always have a cigar in his mouth and he'd drop my neck.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   Exactly.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   And it was, you know, he just, I'll ask, as you should say, I'm just deaf as a post.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.160]   And so he, he was interviewed on stage in Chicago by Roger Ebert.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.660]   And so like there's not, everyone was like sort of milling about in the lobby and it
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.540]   studs was hanging out in the Holy Court.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:29.500]   And for some reason, uh, I, I let just like Alex said, like my voice was like exactly
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.980]   the right tone and timbre for him to hear.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.180]   He's, I, I, I'm deaf as a post.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.740]   If you could just stick nearby and just be thanks to me.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.940]   And so the, I would have done that in a heartbeat.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.820]   And so A was wonderful to stand there for an hour and a half.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.820]   Now studs now, I, you're not going to remember, but you interviewed my mother.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:53.460]   And then for the, and then for this, I imagine for this person and then hearing this, this
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.700]   person, they have no idea that's like, you know, 33 year old that studs.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.700]   You probably don't remember.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.820]   She says you probably don't remember, but yeah, but you interviewed her brother.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.820]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.020]   Your mother was Gloria and she was like, was I like the Sven golly like influence?
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.500]   It was like simultaneously translating.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   I love that.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.500]   Oh man.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.780]   Well, that's what these things would do, right?
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.500]   These things, uh, will be, will tune themselves to your hearing.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.700]   You'll be able to hear the world better.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.700]   I, I have them.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.620]   I haven't yet played with them, but I will have a review for you by next week.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:28.140]   So, you know, I really, I really do like this idea of how, what are, what is human society
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.940]   going to prefer to, prefer to integrate the idea of having an earbud that you really have
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.460]   to look in order to see that someone is getting some sort of assistance.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.820]   Or are they going to prefer this idea where we're going to integrate actually looking at
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.300]   a screen so that yes, I'm looking for information, but there's part of the, part of the social
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.660]   language that we're using is that I am lifting up my watch to look at something or I am lifting
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.340]   up my phone to look at something.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.380]   It's, or it's more explicit with a rather have that seamless experience or would they
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:01.140]   rather have again, part of that sort of language that I'm looking up something right now, but
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.060]   I'm not trying to hide or trying to, you don't have to, you don't have to wonder whether,
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.540]   uh, this is actual recall or whether this is information is coming by.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.620]   I, I already have a, I'm already having a problem getting social cues from people who
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.860]   are using suggested replies or using replies from an Apple watch where I'm getting, I'm
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.660]   asking sort of a complicated question.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.900]   I might be saying something nice.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.420]   Oh, I'm really, really, really sorry.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:29.060]   But I thought that I thought that I was on X-Treat, but I'm on that street and then I'll,
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.620]   I'll, I'll be about 20 minutes late.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.620]   Is that okay?
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:36.620]   When I simply get a, yep, like, okay, is that person, did that person type in a phone?
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.900]   He's really, really pissed off, but he's kind of, he's sort of bottling it in or did he
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.620]   let's just get a notification on his wrist and a button, the tap that says simply, yup.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:50.220]   But don't you notice, Andy, that we're adjusting to that, that we're getting better, exactly,
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:55.980]   including in how we say yup, like the people understand that there's nuance in the communication.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.420]   And if you type you up now, it's with the consciousness of how that might communicate.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.700]   And I think we're getting used to the idea that somebody has in their pocket at all
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:09.340]   times, a fully connected internet device that always knows how old any movie star is.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.260]   And, you know, who's married to whom this year?
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.620]   And so there's no mysteries anymore.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.980]   So having it, I think initially it'll be weird.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.220]   Well, I think that eventually we'll expect people to have this instant, there's, there's
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.300]   also this constant, this constant transitions.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.180]   Yeah, there's, there's constant transition that we move away from, you know, we used
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.020]   to be able to make fires and now we don't know how to do that anymore with, then it was
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.660]   a match, then it was like, well, why would you make a fire?
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.260]   And, and, uh, you know, and I think that we're getting in this situation, I know with my
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:39.140]   calendar, I got really good at using I-Cal, like I will not, I don't remember anything.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.100]   I don't remember anything at all in the calendar.
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.260]   If I want to buy things as I think about them, put them into a, into a shopping list.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.540]   And I, you know, and then I, and then I, um, and when I want to, you know, so when I go
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.140]   to Whole Foods, it's like, that's how I used to rafts.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.020]   I have a, as a complication of my watch.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.060]   And anytime I agree to do something or want something, I just do it there.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.260]   And at the end of the day, I can absorb it.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.900]   It literally is, um, bionics that's not implanted inside us.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.220]   It's bionic that we're wearing now.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.540]   But eventually it's going to be, yeah.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.860]   But what's crazy is, is that I've learned that part of my brain died away.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.300]   I can't, I used to have a-
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.580]   I can't drive anymore.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:10.980]   I'm so dependent on GPS.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   I have no idea.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   I don't know what to do.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.660]   But here's, but here's the wonders of bionics is that you're right.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.900]   I cannot find anything anymore without, without a GPS.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.380]   But I see so much.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.700]   You lost your car, dude.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.700]   I did.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.820]   I did at the liquor store.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:28.860]   Anyway, so anyway, so anyway, so, um, so, uh, I wasn't drinking.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.340]   Anyway, so anyway, I lost my car at the liquor store.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:32.820]   Yes.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.340]   Sounds like a Don McLean song.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:34.700]   Yes.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.180]   Yes.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.820]   But, um, uh, but what's interesting is that-
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.340]   Why is it?
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.420]   Chevy Malibu car.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.420]   Let's just-
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.860]   But I, but I think that what's interesting though is that I explore much more of the
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   world.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.860]   If I'm used to drive, if I'm-
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.500]   No more because of all the six pack of cars.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   Yes.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.500]   But I, my babies.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.500]   Okay.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.500]   Okay.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.500]   We get the answer.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.740]   But I see so much more of the world because I have GPS.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.900]   You know, I see so much more of Tokyo or Rome or Paris because-
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   That's right.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.900]   I'm just gonna walk out there.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.900]   You know, like I'm just gonna walk around.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:07.900]   You don't wanna get-
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:08.900]   Yeah, I'm just gonna look like figured out.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.900]   I'll look down and I'll walk around.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   And so you explore a lot more because you can do it.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   But then on the other side, you can't figure out more.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.220]   But I bet we're one of the first generations that can have this experience because normally
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.900]   this stuff takes generations, right?
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.220]   Here we are.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.780]   This is happening every few years.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.780]   Yeah, it's just extraordinary.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.940]   We don't know how to dial a phone or we don't know how to drive a car.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.660]   We don't know how to light a fire.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:35.820]   I think we're one of the- maybe the first generation in human history that has to adjust to these
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.060]   changes so rapidly all the time.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.860]   Maybe there's never been quite so rapid, but there's always been that sort of-
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.300]   There was a first generation that had the ability to have an- initiate a conversation
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.620]   with somebody without being face to face with them.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.940]   So what is the cultural etiquette?
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.940]   That's right.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:58.420]   And so even- and there's a parallel to one of the biggest difficulties I had when chat
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:03.700]   software first became available was I'm used to salutation.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.860]   Acknowledgement that salutation has been received.
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:07.860]   Conversation.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.380]   End of conversation.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.940]   Acknowledgement that conversation has been ended.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.340]   And it took me a while to retrain my brain to simply-
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.980]   Yo, where is it?
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.740]   I'm going away from the keyboard right now.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.740]   Goodbye.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.740]   Thank you for this conversation.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.900]   It's okay for conversation simply.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.380]   This is why we have the social programming that is always in flux and it's being-
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:33.660]   Affected by not technology but changes in how we choose to interface with each other.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.420]   And there's some of it that I think we lose.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:40.260]   I have some friends in Africa that when you- if you text them or you call them, there
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.540]   is like 15 minutes of house of family and I tell them how- there's a whole like this
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.940]   whole back and forth and literally you cannot have the conversation without it.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.420]   Like it's not- it's not like a possibility to- it would be- it's not that they would
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   be insulted.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.220]   They just won't allow it to happen.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.820]   Like I'll just keep on asking you about how the family is until you solve all those issues.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:04.900]   And when I'm in a rush, I'm really upset about it.
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.780]   But I have to admit, it's quite nice.
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.020]   It's not about- I look forward to- I like that.
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.140]   Going somewhere where that is kind of more of the mode.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.140]   No, it's quite nice.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.140]   Life is a little bit cooler.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.140]   More civil.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.140]   More civil.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.220]   We're all really getting the job done often times.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.300]   Losing the little humanity that-
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.860]   Calling cards.
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:29.220]   When it's not a card that has your name and address and contact, it's just simply a card
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:33.060]   with your name on it that indicates that yes, I paid a call to you early today.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:37.380]   I left this with your servant or- and the way that- and there used to be this whole-
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.580]   it's insane the way these calling cards used to work were.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:47.620]   Then there became this sort of like social code that if a certain corner was folded,
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.060]   it meant that I was just filling a social obligation.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.500]   I'm not expecting you to actually invite me.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   Really?
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.220]   There was a whole code with that?
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.420]   That's cool.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:05.900]   Because this was again just a physical thing that said yes, I was actually here to actually
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.620]   call on you.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:12.380]   Here's the- it's the sort of thing I had to read three times to understand that yes,
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.980]   this is actually how people used to work.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.420]   Well now, like my only thing is that my cards are always black and white so they're scanned
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.420]   easily.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:26.100]   And they're all clear text, clear sans there because I scan people's cards.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.140]   So I never want to- people give me a black card with gray text.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:33.740]   I'm like, "Ah, I'm going to type this in, dang it."
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.380]   I need to get some calling cards printed up.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.220]   They have a call to ask why.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   I paid a call to you.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.420]   It should look like old, older.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.420]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.420]   So I'll tell you one thing.
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.740]   I am- oh yeah, look at this.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:51.260]   On the first visit to a household, a gentleman gave one card to each lady of the house.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.540]   A married man- I hold the wrong order and end up carrying two different-
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.540]   Yeah, me too.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   A married man had a medium-sized card while an unmarried man had a smaller card.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.140]   Men's cards were always smaller than women's.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.020]   When calling upon the lady of the house if she was not home but her daughter was the
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:10.100]   gentleman sent in his card and departed, of course, because you can't.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.640]   And here's the- so a visit in person as opposed to being sent by a servant, the right upper
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.300]   hand corner was turned down.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.900]   A congratulatory visit, the left hand corner.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.020]   A condolence visit, the left hand lower corner.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.860]   Taking leave if you were going on a long trip, the right hand lower corner- this is the art
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.860]   of manliness.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:30.460]   This is actually literally the art of manliness.com.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.460]   This is amazing.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:39.380]   It just goes to show you- we always imagine that if we had a time machine we went back,
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.140]   well, we've got all this fancy technology they wouldn't understand.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:47.340]   We would not understand the concept of a calling card because it is so buried in the society
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.900]   programming that we don't have access to that now.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.580]   Now I want to write a Victorian novel that has-
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   Is that-
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.980]   Is that any explanation?
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.820]   All of this.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:00.460]   He clearly bent the left corner of the card.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.860]   I'll tell you one thing I'm not adjusting to.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.620]   The departure of the Macintosh.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.540]   I'm so sad.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.980]   I feel like we're really coming up against this one.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:16.420]   Now there's an article that says, "This is again from the esteemed Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.700]   Apple's next laptops could be more iPhone than Mac."
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.980]   This is Christopher Mims.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.080]   This is an older article.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:30.420]   This is probably what Phil Schiller was responding to when he was saying, "We're not going to
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.820]   merge Mac OS."
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.820]   No.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.860]   But on the other hand, we've seen Intel really stumbling.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:38.780]   We've seen the ascendancy of ARM.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.580]   It's clear that Apple's going to be doing an ARM.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:49.100]   I think that an ARM for the MacBook, I think the ARM makes total sense.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.300]   I think that the MacBook Pro-
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:56.340]   My understanding is that it will not be any more disruptive to anybody than classic to
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.140]   carbon to cocoa was.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.140]   And that it'll be different.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:04.060]   Like people who are classic Mac people, it took a while to warm up to that cocoa stuff,
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.820]   that crazy next technology that Apple brought in.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.220]   What's that all about?
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.660]   But after a while, that became Mac.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.340]   And we're going to go through a transition where we get ARM at the low end, probably a
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.900]   hybrid in the mid-range and probably still Z on in the top range because it's not real
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.700]   ARM solution for that yet.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.860]   And we'll have a new generation of app technology that leverages everything that's gone into
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.860]   UIKit.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.180]   And it'll feel weird at first, but then at a certain point a few years from now, that
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.940]   will just feel like Mac again.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.620]   Well, and I think that also you're going to see a lot of, now that you're going to be
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:37.200]   able to run your iOS apps on your Mac, you're going to be kind of this merging of your
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   experience.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:44.340]   So how about Daniel Aaron Dilger's article in Apple and Cider saying the new Mac OS Mojave
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:51.220]   optimizes the Mac for iOS users, not PC switchers.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.220]   That's a generational thing.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.100]   I mean, previously Apple's biggest concern was getting everybody who had a PC onto a Mac.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.140]   And now their biggest concern is getting everybody who has an iPhone or an iPad onto
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.140]   it.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.900]   I mean, that's the low hanging fruit in terms of more Mac customers.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.140]   So you think this is true that this is the trend?
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.920]   I don't even know if it makes a lot of sense.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   I don't know.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.920]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   I think we both back away.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   We have a race condition.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.960]   I'm going to give it to Andy here.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.520]   I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.640]   I don't think that Apple is really concerned about switching over people from the PC.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.360]   I think they've, they discovered or planned that the, the solution to that problem was
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.400]   to create something that was not a PC that PC users would prefer.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:34.760]   And that is iOS, articulated on the iPhone and iPhone and on the iPad.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.940]   However, I don't think that there, I really do think there's going to be a larger distinction
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.380]   between consumer grade Macs and pro grade Macs.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:47.100]   I don't, I, I, if this is not, I don't think there's a, any sort of an evil, oh, we internally
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.420]   at Apple, oh, we hate the Mac.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.380]   Oh, we wish we didn't have the short back.
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   No, I don't think so.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:56.300]   But nonetheless, there, I do think, and I've said this before, so I'll say this in a very
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:01.900]   short way, that I do think that Apple just loves and adores iOS.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.280]   And when they think about the future of computing the future of the company, they don't think
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.400]   about Mac OS, they think about iOS.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:14.320]   And so I don't think that their, their instinct is going to be to continue to evolve Mac OS
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.920]   in the same way that other operating systems have evolved in the past five or 10 years.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:23.200]   So I think that the professional apps are going to pretty much stay on the same kind of hardware
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.640]   and the same sort of experience.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:31.340]   And I would be surprised at five years from now, Mac OS were as, were as recognizable to
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:35.060]   us today as simple new user interface elements.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:40.020]   I think it's going to be a beefier version of iOS as opposed to an enhanced version of
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.300]   Mac OS or an appearance anyway.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.940]   And I don't think they're trying to transition iOS to Mac.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.500]   I think they're just trying to make it easier for us that have iOS apps that we really wish
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.580]   we could use on our Mac when we're not doing that and being able to open up in a corner
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.580]   or do whatever.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:56.240]   I think it just makes it better for us, a better experience than one for people who cross over.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.360]   I don't think they care if anybody buys a Mac.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.040]   I mean, that already uses iOS.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.940]   I mean, they're already a user.
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:08.560]   I think that the, I think they used to, but I don't think that now it matters and or it
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.980]   won't matter for much longer.
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:13.400]   I do agree with Andy that I think that the low, the lower end of the Mac, I think will
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.240]   be very iOS-y.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:22.080]   I think the high end of the Mac will probably stay, stay in the current form of for the
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.580]   next five, maybe 10 years.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.860]   There's also, I mean, like the stuff that OS 10 is currently Mac OS 10 is currently built
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:29.860]   on is next technology.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.980]   And if you look at the Mac today, it's not that dissimilar from what would next was running
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:37.980]   20 years ago, an app kit has been updated, but app kit has not been updated at the rate
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.980]   that iOS has.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.760]   And that's just a function of the amount of effort you need to put into a platform that's
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:47.480]   run by a billion people rather than tens of millions of people.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.320]   And it would be good for both platforms if they sort of both got the best of everything.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.060]   And once you start bringing iOS, and they made that point, they said you have the traditional
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:59:01.560]   app kit apps, you have web apps, you have OpenGL now metal apps, then probably be Vulcan
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.520]   apps at some point running on the Mac.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.600]   And each of them serves a different purpose and running UI kit apps on the Mac.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:12.000]   You'll sort of get the best of the huge library of titles you have on iOS.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.160]   But also UI kit, it comes from the same core technology, but it's just a much more modern.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.400]   It's like, if you could have done app kit over again.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.880]   And at some point you do because it just won't take you any further.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.240]   And they're going to have to do a UI kit.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   You like it.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   It's like 12 years old now already.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.440]   And you've got to keep modernizing these things.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.440]   And I think if they do this right, and it's always a huge if, we'll get the best of a
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.240]   modern Apple framework for both platforms to run on.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.440]   And yeah, it'll probably bias towards iOS just because we're becoming more mobile.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.040]   Just everything is more mobile.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.360]   iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, outsell, desktop, Macs, but a huge amount, we're becoming a mobile
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:51.160]   society, but I think both platforms will definitely benefit from being on the same page.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:56.200]   One Apple is kind of like a parent loves both its kids equally, but it has a favorite.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.640]   You know, you look at married with kids and one's Taylor Swift.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   I like it.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.400]   It likes it's on Christmas.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.880]   One kid gets the bicycle.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.200]   The other kid gets the cardboard box.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   The bicycle can't.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.680]   But you want that bad.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.320]   I owe why you're complaining.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.960]   No, but one kid is married with kids and established and the other kid is Taylor Swift.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   And it's hard to manage.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.160]   Like they don't need the same amount of management.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.360]   And, you know, like I look at my kids, my kids are very familiar with the iOS and they do
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.640]   fine on a PC.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   They do fine on a Mac.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   They do.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640]   Okay.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   But they don't really understand.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.880]   It's easier for them.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880]   What course it is.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.080]   What's funny is they don't really understand file structure.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.360]   Like it's something that you have to really talk about, like where to put your files because
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.600]   it's just not something that they're they think about.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.160]   They just, you know, they just get what they need within their app.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.160]   And that's an interesting to me.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.440]   That was the biggest thing is like not thinking about no, sometimes there's some of us that
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.160]   don't think about where to put our files yet either, you know.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.520]   I've seen your desktop.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.160]   It's all on the desktop.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.440]   It's only on the desktop for a little while.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.320]   Then I got sorted away.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.320]   Let's take a break.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.560]   When we come back, I want to talk about Apple's plans for TV, but first a word from rocket
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.520]   to mortgage by quick and loans.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.440]   Only quick and loans could do this.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.000]   Let's talk about buying a house for a minute.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.840]   You know, it takes a while.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.200]   I remember we searched for a house for a long time before we found just the right one,
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.840]   made some offers on some.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.600]   The problem is it can be, you know, I mean, in a way, the house hunting process is fun,
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.160]   but it can be agonizing because as you're looking interest rates, particularly now,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.720]   might be ratcheting up and that home is going to cost you more and more and more.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.000]   That's why you're going to love the new rocket mortgage power buying process from quick and
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   loans.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Here's how it works.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.360]   Quick and loans verifies as always, verifies your income assets and credit in less than
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360]   24 hours.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.040]   They'll give you a verified approval.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.800]   By the way, verified approval is like being a cash buyer.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.880]   It means that the seller knows you're good for it, but that when your offer comes in,
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.720]   this is a genuine offer you've already got guaranteed, got the money.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.920]   Now once you're verified, then you qualify for this is the new thing, the all new exclusive
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.160]   rate shield approval.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.120]   They'll lock up your rate for 90 days while you shop.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.520]   If rates go up, no problem.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.520]   The rate doesn't.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.520]   Here's a nice feature though.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.440]   If the rate goes down, yes, your rate does go down.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.680]   Either way, you win.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.000]   You're guaranteed it's not going to cost you more than this during the entire home buying
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   process.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   That's really huge.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.920]   It's exactly the kind of thinking you'd expect from America's largest and best mortgage
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.440]   lender to get started.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.440]   It's simple.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.680]   As always, go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.040]   Rate shield approvals valid only on certain 30-year purchase transactions, additional conditions,
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.360]   or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   and
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:49.560]   equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org 30-30-rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.640]   We thank them for their support.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.680]   I always love seeing the good work that the information does.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.440]   That's why I subscribe to the information.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:06.280]   They broke an interesting story a few days ago, an exclusive Apple-I streaming bundle for
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.200]   TV, music, and news.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   Shocked.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.200]   Shocked.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.320]   There's subscription fatigue is real.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.640]   You can't just subscribe to everything.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.160]   It gets so expensive.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.480]   Remember that they're beefing up Apple news.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.760]   They acquired texture.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   They've made deals with Oprah and a bunch of other people to make content.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.160]   They have Apple music.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   They have Apple music.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.360]   As a first step toward the new offering, by the way, I should give credit to Jessica Tunkle
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.320]   who's writing this in the information, Apple's expected to launch a digital news subscription
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.240]   service next year.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.520]   The service would combine Apple news with a magazine subscription service acquired by
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.720]   Apple and March texture.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.720]   As a next step, this is all kind of distant future.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.400]   Apple's looking to bundle the digital news subscription with video content it's begun
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.400]   producing.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.760]   That might be a year off.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.000]   Of course, your Apple music subscription.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.640]   It's unclear when Apple will unveil a new subscription offering she writes.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.040]   The company would also continue to allow subscribers.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.760]   This is important to sign up for each separately.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.120]   You didn't have to buy the bundle, but the bundle will be available.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.400]   You could still say, "I just want Apple music."
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.560]   I think that's actually pretty smart.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.480]   Alex, you've been saying this.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.040]   That's what they would do all along.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.000]   It just makes sense to just say, "Oh, I want to pay $15 a month or $20 a month or whatever
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   that number is."
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.520]   I think if it goes over $20 a month or $30, I think it's probably the outer edge of what
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.720]   you get for solving all your content needs.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.360]   Quite 10 bucks separately.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.960]   So together, 20 or 25 or whatever.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.520]   I think if you got up to above $30, you'd have a problem.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   No, that's too much.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.520]   20, I would do.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.520]   20, I think, would be easy.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.000]   Because 15 would be like, "Holy smokes."
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Texture is $10.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.960]   The music is $10.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:50.920]   If you throw in news and movies and it was still 20, that's a good price.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   That's a great price.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.680]   And their TV offering is minimal because, again, they have no back catalog the way Netflix
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.120]   and other companies do.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120]   Right.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.840]   And if they beta, the real strength there would be to beta with the music, the tens of millions
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.920]   of people, they already have in music.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.920]   You know, say, "We're going to give it to you all for six months or so."
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.720]   So Apple, of course, declined to comment.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.800]   But Jessica says her sources inside Apple are telling her this is something they're looking
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.800]   at.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:21.080]   It kind of makes sense that they'd be looking at the success of the Amazon Prime Model and
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.920]   saying, "Well, what if you give us a fixed amount of money every month and we just give
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.280]   you a boatload of features and we keep adding to those features as we keep going on, but
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.920]   we don't charge you $90 to start and keep upping it for a few years until--
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.000]   What about a yearly-- what about-- because I mean, people are happy to pay Amazon Prime
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.960]   for $90 a year.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.640]   So if it's an attractive package, you know, the Amazon got me because it wasn't any one
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.720]   specific thing.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.440]   It was just the idea of, "Look at all that I get for this annual fee."
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.280]   And the fact that it's psychologically the fact that it wasn't, "Here's $x a month you're
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.520]   spending on this that you might be using this month you might not be using.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.240]   If I just simply accept that I'm going to be spending-- this is part of my yearly budget,
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.360]   it's just sort of easy to swallow."
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:07.800]   So you think about what are people's biggest complaints about Apple services?
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:13.000]   And one of them is this really, really stingy amount of storage you get in iCloud.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.880]   Well, what if, as part of this package, you were getting music, you were getting TV, but
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.680]   you were also getting 500 gigabytes of iCloud storage and a really good rate every time you
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.760]   wanted to increase it, particularly if you wanted to increase it so that you could back
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.880]   up an iOS device?
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.920]   One of the things I think is going to be-- I think it's going to affect all the prices
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.120]   for all of these things is that I think that where these companies that wanted to get rid
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.960]   of net neutrality want to go, I don't think they're really going to attack the little
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.720]   guy trying to get their video service off the ground because you can't get a video service
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.800]   off the ground even before net neutrality because of peering.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.400]   He had to pay a lot of money to peer in a way.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.400]   There was no net neutrality.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:56.440]   Don't you love it that-- I mean, it's already-- I've got new caps, we've got new expenses,
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.780]   AT&T, which swore it would lower prices when it merged with Time Warner as raised direct
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.760]   TVs price by five bucks a month.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.760]   Why?
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   It's all the time.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.600]   It's already just-- I mean, they didn't even have the grace to wait a little bit.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   Let us look great.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   We're in now, baby.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.520]   Well, and I think that one of the things that I think a lot of them want to do is zero
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.880]   rate.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.720]   They want to force Apple, Netflix, Google, Facebook to zero rate against your Comcast
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   subscription.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   So your Comcast subscription will get capped.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.080]   Let's say it's going to be at 200 gigs a month.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.360]   But Apple and Netflix and Google and all these other folks will pay at a zero rate against
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.360]   that.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.360]   They pay Comcast.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   No, pay Comcast.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360]   And Comcast doesn't count.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.360]   And its customers are so happy.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.560]   Oh, it doesn't cost me extra.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.760]   It doesn't cost you extra.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.840]   So what happens though is that you'll think about everything else.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.240]   So they're not going to charge the little guy to get access.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.600]   Oh, they're going to charge the big companies.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:54.680]   But they're going to make billions on the big companies to zero rate their services.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.880]   I think that's what's probably happening.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.960]   And part of it is that there is a lot of complexity.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:02.000]   I mean, 5G is going to be the most expensive rollout ever.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.080]   And it is going to-- but you're never going to think about-- a lot of people are never
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.080]   going to have a router at home.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.080]   They're just going to have 5G.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080]   And they're going to go wherever they go.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.080]   And it's just 5G.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.040]   That's what about five years out before we just--
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.680]   We see the end of home networks entirely.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.120]   I mean, there'll be a handful of us that are geeky that want our own route.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.120]   But my pants--
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   That's one of the reasons--
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.760]   Oh, it's just trying to get into wireless business.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.200]   I mean, this is for the sole cable operators.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.200]   This is the end.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.840]   I mean, they have to figure out the wireless solution because the cable operator-- the
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:35.120]   cell phone operators are, hey, they have to make more money because they are going to--
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.680]   And they're going to build a lot of other things.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.480]   They're going to build high-speed internet for professionals.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.440]   So people like me will most likely get our own lines.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.840]   So right now, when you take a live view to a concert, I've got six modems and they still
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840]   won't work.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   That won't be a problem with 5G.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.280]   They'll charge us thousands of dollars a month so that we can not have to interact
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.640]   with the general population.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.120]   Here's the weirdest story of the week.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.240]   Lego and iPhone connect for low-cost nerve gas detector.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.880]   Worried about Saren and VX?
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.080]   Make your own.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.400]   I've often thought about.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.840]   I wonder if Nodow will be attacked by a Disney in there.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.200]   I think they ought to be involved.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.920]   In a related story, a lot of researchers have been feeding thousands and thousands of
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.800]   news headlines to a machine learning program to create fake news headlines.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800]   And I think this is one of the results.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.800]   Is this one of them?
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800]   I'm thinking on it.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.040]   Researchers at the University of Texas Austin have come up with a simple way to detect
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.920]   and identify nerve agents.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.960]   And so they built this with an iPhone and Lego bricks because you need a chamber, a
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.760]   chemical sensor in a chamber that changes colors and brightness to indicate which nerve
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.680]   agents are present, how concentrated they are.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.360]   And so unfortunately it can be difficult to see differences in the level of fluorescence
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.000]   with the naked eye in the field.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.320]   So they made this little thing out of Lego.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.160]   There's some TV show where they go, "Is there a Lego land anywhere nearby?"
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.000]   "We've got to build it."
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.560]   It uses the iPhone's camera to photograph and analyze the sensor's results.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.760]   University of Texas graduate student Alexander Bull Gokov created this software as available
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.760]   on GitHub.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.640]   It can be adapted for other operating systems.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.440]   But this was part of a drunken bet, I bet.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.520]   I bet you can make a chemistry professor, Eric Anselin, said, "Chemical weapons are dangerous
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.320]   threats to humanity.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.400]   Detection and neutralization are key to saving lives."
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:40.720]   And now thanks to Lego and iPhone, YouTube can be safe.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:47.440]   I don't know, it's not Link Bay, it's true, but it's probably not something coming soon
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.160]   to a store near you.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.200]   Are you excited about Pikachu hiding behind real world objects?
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.600]   I'm excited about this technology.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.920]   The occlusion technology I think is really cool.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:05.880]   Yeah, so this is something Niantic, which does, of course, the game.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.240]   Oh, and they just announced their platform too, so there'll be a bunch of stuff powered
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240]   by their engines.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240]   Oh, really?
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:19.000]   Yeah, they started with the really fun game that was so complicated that they did.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.640]   I can't remember now the name.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.160]   Yeah, and now they're partnering with Warner Brothers to make Harry Potter, but they're
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.920]   also going to make their engine available to other companies.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.360]   See, now this is AR.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.800]   Look at Pikachu's climbing in a tree.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.200]   He's running around.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   That would be cool.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   That's the idea.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   I'm going to do that.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.360]   Do you notice that he kept climbing through people?
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.920]   Yeah, he ran through people.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.960]   So this was the occlusion technology.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   Ghost Pikachu.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   Look at that.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.720]   He's running around behind plants.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.200]   He knows where people are.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.440]   Wow, that is pretty cool.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.000]   I'll be playing more Pokemon intro.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.960]   The tracking isn't very good in that example.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:00.960]   Well, the tracking is a good, but the occlusion technology is great, but the tracking is surprisingly
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.960]   bad.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.760]   And it's got a lot of detail that I'm going to grab onto.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   I don't quite understand.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.800]   Yeah, which Pokemon is that one?
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   Is it a Fox?
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   Oh, no, that's Eevee.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.240]   That's one that evolves into all the different types.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.960]   Like, yeah, yeah, I have an Eevee.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.000]   They pour it on and flare in and go Tiana and be on and.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.400]   You know way too much about this stuff.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.000]   Well, I don't know.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.800]   The Pokemon topic is almost as popular as iPhone online where these days.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.120]   I'm playing it again.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.480]   Thanks to you, you son of a.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.480]   I think I forget.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.000]   There's like 100,000 people in Germany over the weekend for their Safari part event.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.480]   That's crazy for a digital game.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.320]   It's back, baby.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.480]   It's really fun to play.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.400]   I got to go, but I got to start walking more so I can catch more stuff.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.800]   Got to catch them walking is great.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.800]   You how many column?
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.760]   Oh, look, I got to get some stuff.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   Hold on.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   I'll be back with you.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   There's a few.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.400]   Like, I used to live inside and I get in a car and I drive somewhere and now I go out
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.480]   and I walk and I make my neighbors and I meet people in my area and I have a ton of people
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.280]   that I never knew lived here that I know now and I found all these parks that I didn't
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.720]   know existed that were tucked away behind other things that I would never have found
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.280]   except they have like a little Pokemon thing.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.760]   Do they have a Pookie stop?
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760]   What do you go on there?
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760]   No.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   No, and now I enjoy them.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.200]   The reason I won't I won't I stopped playing one night.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.400]   There was like a night that I decided I'm not going to play Pokemon anymore and that was
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.200]   I because I loved it and everything else but I was at I was in it was a middle of the
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   night and I was at Istanbul at Hagas Sophia temple.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.720]   Oh, and you were playing Pokemon.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720]   No, I wasn't playing.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.720]   I wasn't playing.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.560]   I was walking around with a friend of mine there and it was like middle of the night and
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.120]   we were walking down and full just this most amazing thing to see and I turned I was a
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.560]   whole bunch of people crowded over it like right next to it.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560]   They're all crowded around.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560]   They're all like an Apama.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.720]   I walked over and they were like no, they were playing Pokemon and I was like I can't do
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.320]   this anymore like this is this is going like I just decided I can't be part of it.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.240]   I thought people were playing Pokemon and turned out that school had started and they
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.640]   were all just waiting for a bus and I was terribly embarrassed.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.440]   You want to play Pokemon?
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.280]   Oh, never mind.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   What is building?
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.600]   You know, way you are talking about.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.200]   But I would love to see others do stuff with Niantic there wasn't there rumored to be a
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.720]   Harry Potter game that they were.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.720]   Yeah, that's official now.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.760]   They're doing it with Warner Brothers and you're going to be able to go and catch your
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.160]   hope your Harry Potter.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.480]   I think it's strange or strangest creatures.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.480]   Fantastic creatures.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.480]   Well, that would be cool.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.880]   I'm going to say I thought it was going to be like Slytherin versus good.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:27.080]   Every franchise is going to get into AR gaming because it's so much.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.120]   But you really need it's an AR hat.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:33.880]   An AR hat that you pointed somebody and it pops on their head and it goes around.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880]   Oh, it's a Gryffindor.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   Gryffindor.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.080]   And I think Disney has an AR experience now when you're at the park when you're waiting
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.520]   for rides and things.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.520]   Oh, yeah, everybody.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.920]   It makes so much sense.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.000]   Apple is now selling according to I'm more.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.520]   I've heard of them a smart ball that records data as you play.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.400]   This is not an Apple product, but you can get it at the Apple store exclusively at the
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.520]   Apple stores called Play Impossible's Smart Game Ball.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.600]   Tell me about this.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.000]   I have actually not tried it yet.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.200]   I've been so out of the loop with all the iOS beta stuff.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.200]   The world has passed around me, Leo.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   I have not.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.120]   Well, if you've never heard of the game ball, it's essentially a small soccer like ball that
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.480]   contains an accelerometer, barometer, microcontroller, ultra capacitor and other super cool tech.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:24.880]   As you play with it, it sends data via Bluetooth to the accompanying iOS app in real time.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.200]   There are also modes that guide you through specific activities, allow you to compete in
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:34.920]   games with friends like Splash, a water balloon toss game and Jossle, a version of Keep Away.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.880]   What's more?
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.840]   Game balls, game oriented play goes beyond individual games.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.520]   The more you play with it, the more experienced points you receive.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.520]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.520]   I think that one of the things that's interesting about this is that we're going to see more
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.240]   sensors being added to just regular things.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.240]   If you think about a baseball, you could be telling the feedback that you could give to
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.720]   someone who's learning or trying to perfect it.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.000]   It would know how well you threw a curve or what your fastball was or even give you targets
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.800]   that were just virtual.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.760]   That small sensors inside the ball would provide.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.920]   It would give you a lot of data.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.960]   That's a, there are already training balls like that.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   There are soccer balls like that that have different features on them.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:25.520]   When it's surprised we haven't seen gameplay change in ball sensors before the Flying Car
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:31.080]   Montesauff brothers a few years ago, they teamed up with engineers from the MIT Media
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:36.920]   Lab and they developed a set of translucent juggling balls and pins that had different
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.160]   colored lights inside them that responded to accelerometers and other data that was
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.600]   being fed to in real time to a computer backstage so that for a whole bunch of effects, like
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.960]   stage effects where you could actually see vectors being plotted on a screen behind them
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.800]   of where each ball is and what it's being doing.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.160]   But they also programmed the computer to give them like sort of games to play where the color
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.240]   of a club would change in mid-air.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.920]   And because they're also wearing gloves with sensors inside them, it could tell who had
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.520]   caught which pin.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:16.400]   So, a pin that changes color now has to be caught by somebody that the computer knows
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.960]   is out of position to catch and throw that pin again.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.040]   So I really, really want to see like brand new games being played.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.640]   We never got to see what Preasy Squares was like in Star Trek.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:34.400]   I bet it has something to do with velocity and acceleration and gravitometric sensors
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.440]   inside balls that basically change the rules of the game.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.160]   Actually, it's not Preasy Squares would be like Kelvin Ball with a game of the rules
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.640]   changing based on like the whims of this of a computer backstage.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   Oh, wouldn't that be fun?
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   All right.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.640]   I only have one question.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   Green or purple?
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   Which color?
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   Green.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   Oh, I'm out of that.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   One is the Hulk and one of the Hulk's pants.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   It's so hard to decide.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   The Hulk or the Hulk's pants?
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   Zoothoor.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   99.95.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   I'm going to buy one.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   I'll have it by next week.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   I'll have it by next week.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   Say again?
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.960]   They have a connected bicycle helmet at the Apple Store as well.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   Let's watch these children.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.000]   Hey, can I press?
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   They're playing.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.280]   She just bounced it off his head.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.280]   That doesn't seem nice.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.480]   He realized that ball cost $100.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.480]   Don't throw that.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.720]   You have to like nook together.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   So they're playing different games with it.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.720]   Oh, you have to charge it up.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.720]   Oh.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   Oh.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.400]   I guess you would have it in the end.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   Victory!
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:47.760]   What will be interesting is also, could you turn that into like a physics class, you know,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.040]   on momentum and a lot of other things as well.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040]   Hopefully, though.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.080]   Did you see that ARKit demo where they were showing the, like you put two molecules together
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.640]   and they created like, and they create the substance and then you move them around and
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.920]   they break apart and they go and buy into it?
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.920]   That was so cruel.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:03.920]   Let me just buy this ball.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.920]   Go ahead.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:05.920]   You two talk amongst.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.920]   Talk amongst yourselves about ARKit molecules demos.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920]   You sell.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.600]   I think that, I mean, I definitely think that within a school environment, we're just getting
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.280]   started and it's, the hard part is just that it's expensive to get, you know, the cost
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.240]   of admission is high for a lot of schools.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.040]   But I think that this is where it, you know, wants to go, you know, is to use a lot of these
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.280]   technologies to deepen people's understanding of how this stuff works.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.840]   And also for different kinds of learners, because some people do hear like their audio
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.960]   learners, but some people are kinesthetically aware and they need to see things and interact
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.680]   with them and it's impossible to do some of these things in the real world and they can
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.680]   actually see it.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.400]   I think that, I think all, some people are better.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.120]   In my opinion, some people are better at reading than others, but almost, but for two
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.000]   million years, what we did is we watched other people do it, then we worked with them
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   and did it.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   And then we figured it out.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.320]   I mean, we're, as human beings, we're, we're really good at, there's some people that
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:01.240]   are better at being cerebral because they've evolved, you know, to, to, to being able to
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.840]   read and think through it and everything else.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:08.560]   But as a, as a species, I think that we are being able to interact with it is, is how we
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.320]   developed for millions of years.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.960]   Still buying, which ball did you get one of each?
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.960]   Are you getting one of each?
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.520]   No, I should get the green one.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.400]   You're right because it's a little easier to see, but I'm buying the purple one because
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.800]   that one is sitting right next to me.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.800]   Thought a court in the world will convict you.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.320]   I think about how something I think would be used to map a room.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.600]   I'm not even, I'm not even joking.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.280]   Just toss it against a wall.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.520]   Catch it back where you are before.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.080]   Toss it against another wall.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.760]   I'll have it Friday and we'll have it for the game.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.560]   I've been waiting to see if my, my little, my pool thing.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560]   I can't, I'm surprised at the back.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.920]   I have like a little Roomba, like, you know, for the pool.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.920]   I have very complicated pool.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.800]   And so it, and it, it kind of goes back and forth.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.600]   And I'm like, I wonder if it's mapping it now.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.600]   It's just reacting to it.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.040]   I don't think it really does make a map.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.720]   The Roomba does, but this is like a, this is a.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.720]   Pool Roomba made a dolphin.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.440]   It's what it's called the dolphin.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440]   It's a dolphin.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.400]   It's just, you know, a random walk probably is just as good as anything you could do if
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   it mapped it out.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   I did a time lapse of it.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   It's really actually quite fun.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   Is it?
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   You got it?
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   You got it?
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   Text it to me.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.440]   Uh, my Roomba would just be showing me, here's where all the cables and cardboard boxes and
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.240]   discarded pieces of clothing are on your.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.800]   Here's why we couldn't actually work in your house.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.560]   I think we can, uh, I think we can go to our picks of the week.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560]   What do you say?
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560]   I think we should.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.560]   You're in?
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560]   Do you mind?
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560]   Yup.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.160]   Do you have any other stories that you, you want to talk about anything else you want to
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160]   talk about?
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.880]   All right.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.280]   I think we should get, uh, Renee Richie's pick of the week right now.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.360]   So I forgive me because I did miss a couple of shows.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.800]   So if somebody mentioned this already, I apologize, but it is so neat.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.600]   So I've been using AirPods like Alex so much that now, like I'm using this just because
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.960]   I prefer wired for the show.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.400]   So I don't get yelled at by everybody involved, but wireless, once you're free, you're free
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.160]   and it's so great.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.400]   But then you go on an airplane and you're like, Oh, ho, ho, ho is me.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.080]   But the people at 12 South found these little, uh, Bluetooth dongles and packaged them up
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.560]   ever so nicely.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.720]   So it's called Airfly.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.920]   It's made by 12 South comes with this adapter.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.880]   You plug it into the 3.5 millimeter jack on your airplane if it's actually working, which
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.720]   sometimes sometimes it isn't, but you plug this in and then it creates a Bluetooth connection.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.480]   You connect your AirPods to it and you are using your AirPods in the plane.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.680]   And if you have to get up and go to the washroom, there's no cord.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.600]   The person next to you has to get up and what you don't have to try to.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:40.400]   Yeah, you don't have to extricate yourself and you can use it anywhere that it's not,
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.680]   I use it on airplanes, but you can, you just use it any, if your car, for example, has
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:50.040]   a 3.5 out and you really want to use your AirPods, uh, put it in there anywhere that
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.160]   anywhere that it's a wireless adapter for a wired world.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.920]   Isn't that an ironic statement?
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:56.920]   Yes.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   Yes.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.200]   We finally have to figure out a way to make the AirPods work with a headphone jack.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:09.480]   Well, now that you know, a dongle for the real world, you win absolutely ludicrous.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.120]   But when you're sitting in the plane and you're like, the last thing I want to do is wire
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.880]   up a pair of headphones like a monster and you just plug this in and you're fine.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.480]   Uh, second one.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.480]   Thank you.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.480]   All right.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.760]   Alex is mailing me the, the time lapse of his pool dolphin.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:31.760]   Oh, as soon as he's completed, as Alex does, as, as one does, you know, in the days of
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.560]   the floppy disk, he could just hand you a floppy.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560]   I know.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   I know.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.920]   I'll also, while we have a second, I'll recommend Luke Cage season two on Netflix.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920]   Is it good?
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.920]   I almost watched that last time.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   It is.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   The music is amazing.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.280]   The story is way better than season one.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   Terrific.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.280]   Good to know.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.280]   Okay.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.280]   Andy, your pick of the week.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.440]   Um, my main pick of the week is something really, really simple.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.400]   Uh, it's the Google play music desktop player.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.800]   Uh, cause I do use Google play music and I like have it.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.680]   The problem is that you have to, there is no desktop player for you have to actually
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:09.080]   run it inside a browser window and number one, that might raise up a whole lot more resources
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.240]   than you actually want.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.600]   Uh, and number two.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.120]   I have to figure out exactly what tab of what window this, this damn player is in.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.680]   Whereas if I have it running as a separate app, I can simply tab over to it.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.240]   I can, it's a way to have a hovering window everywhere.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:29.480]   Uh, it's not a hugely feature bonus compared to what you're running inside the, uh, inside
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.640]   the web app, but it's not simply a container for the web app.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:37.760]   It's a, it's an open source, a GitHub project, uh, that's been updated for a long, long time.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:41.400]   Uh, and so as soon as I discovered that, uh, a couple of weeks ago, it has been my
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.600]   go to music player for that.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.840]   Uh, and I have noticed that my system seems to be running a little bit better with it
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.400]   because I, and partly because maybe I no longer have like seven instances of Google play music
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.640]   app running inside different tabs inside my browser, uh, because I'm no longer just simply
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.000]   typing the URL every time I want to look at another album.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.800]   Uh, so there's also a mobile remote controls you can download for iOS so that you can now
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.280]   control it from, from your phone, why you wouldn't, in case you didn't initiate it from
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.600]   your phone to begin with, uh, and it's free, free, free.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.160]   You can just donate money for it if you want.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.440]   Uh, but like I said, sometimes it doesn't have to be super complicated to be the right
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.080]   solution for what you wanted.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.080]   This is just what I want.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.560]   I just want a player that stands in its own app and its own window, uh, so that I can
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.960]   shuffle around apps, close down chroma still have access to Google, Google play music.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.960]   Awesome.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.160]   I use it too.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.760]   I'm a Google play music subscriber.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.640]   That always makes me that always the, the, the app or Google play music.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.360]   Uh, I subscribe to Google play.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.360]   The player.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   Oh no, I do use the player.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   I listen to it all.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, Alex Lindsey's dolphin.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360]   You do have a complicated pool.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   What the hell is going on there?
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   I did.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.860]   You got tree log, tree stumps in there and like, there's like just a lot of stones there.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:07.260]   Is that a hot tub that it's cleaning or is it just a separate little separate area?
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.360]   A little separate section there for the youngins.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.160]   Has anybody ever written a version of logo for like these pool cleaner?
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160]   I wouldn't that be fun.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.160]   Step forward three.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   This is brought to you by the pool gal.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.360]   The pool gal was the, the person who cleans the pool and she was like, your pool is crazy.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.360]   I got, you need it.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.360]   So she brought one in.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.060]   She brought one in and now I'm going to have to get one because this thing is amazing.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.060]   See, this is good.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.060]   Then you don't need a pool gal.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.560]   No, I still need, there's like chemicals in their thing.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:33.560]   It's complicated.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.420]   No interest in being, you asked Lisa, what do you guys do?
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.580]   I still, like the problem is right on the other side of the pool, the pine trees, like
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:44.860]   every time we swim, there's like, there's a 15 minute prop prep for me.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:46.860]   Oh, because the pine trees are dropping needles.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860]   Needles are awesome.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:48.860]   So that's why you need it.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.860]   That place for a pool.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.260]   Oh, I know you, I know remember what you told me.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.060]   So you were going to 3D print a cover.
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.060]   I'm working on that.
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.860]   So that's, well, you now understand why you understand the, there's no cover that will
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860]   fit that odd.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:01.860]   No, no, no.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:06.200]   So you need to, how much PLA are you going to need to make that cover, man?
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.320]   Well, so we were, I have some friends that have a shop bot, which does four by eight
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.320]   sheets.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.620]   And so we're talking about whether the foam will work so that basically we can, uh,
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.620]   stitch it together.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:19.120]   Like, I know it's just four by eight sheet of, oh no, I'm doing it for the, for the actual
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.360]   hot tub area, which is still as complicated as that.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.460]   It's just not in the picture.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:27.800]   So the, um, but the, uh, it's, I think I can have two four by eight sheets that are kind
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   of open up.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:36.820]   Because if you spray expanding foam onto it, then it's solidify and then peel it off.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:40.320]   The problem with the expanding foam is you need to come, I spent a lot of time, quality
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   time with expanding foam.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   Is it float?
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   Uh, I've never tried to use it with water.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320]   It must float with foam.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.320]   It's foam.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320]   It might work.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.720]   It might, it might actually contain and push up.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.200]   It'd be really funny at the bottom because it'd be all lumpy because it would just burst
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.960]   against the water until it reached some kind of equilibrium.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:54.960]   Right.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.040]   But it's, uh, yeah, when I worked at it, I, you know, my first job out of high school was
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.880]   shipping and receiving for an electronics company.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.240]   So my, my,
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:07.000]   Guder X, by the way, is saying that, uh, independence day 2018 will get you 15% off at 12th,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.520]   south for the next 48 hours.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.680]   So if you want to get Renee's, uh, Bluetooth dongle, have some real freedom.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.680]   Independence day, 2018.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   All one word.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.680]   Real independence.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.680]   Happy.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.960]   There's, I don't know what it is about this time of year, but everybody's doing sales.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.560]   This is a good time to shop around because, uh, everybody's selling stuff.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.080]   Amazon prime days next week.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:30.080]   It's just, yeah.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.080]   It's the in between.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.080]   They're like, we gotta do something.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.080]   Christmas is still six months away.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.080]   People are having a phone.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.080]   They're not.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080]   Gosh darn it.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.080]   Get shopping kids.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080]   Get out of the beach.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.520]   You should be, you should be inside vulnerable to the self doubts that we fill you with.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.200]   They make you want to fill, avoid the consumer products.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.800]   Don't go splashing about the ocean with your friends and family.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, it's time for your pick of the week.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:03.600]   So, uh, I, this is, uh, this, have you seen audio kit synth one?
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.640]   No, but it sounds like something I'd want.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.640]   Yes.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.720]   A, uh, a special thank you to David B. Edney, who was the one that recommended it on Facebook
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.880]   and it was, it is addicting.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:21.600]   Uh, it is free, free open source and, um, uh, and just, there are so many layers.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.600]   Like if you start to, so you have, let's see if I, I don't think I have it.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.920]   I can show this on this screen.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920]   Just, uh, is the audio turn all the way up?
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920]   I'll mic it.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.920]   Oh, why is that?
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.400]   See, of course it's, it's not a work it.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400]   Hold on.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400]   Hold on.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   It's not working.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.680]   See, now it's, it's not, it's not working.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.960]   I'm sure that my, my, uh, it's too complicated.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.360]   No, my computer is like, it's probably connected to some way.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.880]   So when they say ROM player, what does that mean?
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.360]   ROM players playing sample?
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.840]   Oh, this is, yeah, it's playing sample.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.560]   It's a full on synthesizer.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:02.880]   And, uh, it is, uh, I'm just trying to figure out why.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.920]   Can you play the intro from the kind of final countdown on this?
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:06.920]   That's all it.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:07.920]   Do you?
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.920]   Exactly.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.360]   I didn't want to test it while we were.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.360]   It's like on here.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.560]   It's like a whole countdown or Bohemium wrapped it in that little jam.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.960]   I'm wondering whether it's using audio somewhere else.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.960]   So this is an open source project, which is kind of interesting.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:26.440]   It's, it's, um, open source sample player app code.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.920]   Built with audio kit pros leading open source audio framework, powering millions of app
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:31.920]   installs.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   Wow.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:39.880]   Apple design winner fortune 100 is lovingly used by startups into developers.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.560]   Apple design award winners and even fortune 100 companies.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.200]   It's completely free and open source.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.840]   So that's the, uh, kit, but then there's a, an app.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.240]   This is ROM player that you downloaded.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240]   Is that the app?
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.800]   Uh, this is audio kit synth one audio kit synth one.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:54.960]   And you can download it.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   It's, it's, uh, there it is.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   Okay.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.080]   It's free on the, uh, free and open source pro iPad synthesizer built with audio kit.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.080]   And of course, nice.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.400]   Of course, the, the thing is last time I, I used it before I got here.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.800]   My daughter had it and she's, she is, well, let me play a video.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   Let's just play a short video.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.440]   A short video with audio.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:16.320]   For the past two years, we've had a crazy dream.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.880]   The dream of creating the world's first free and open source professional synth for the
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.880]   iPad.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.880]   It's free.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.880]   No ads.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.880]   No, it not purchases.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:25.880]   Nothing to buy.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:28.840]   This is going to be free for everyone.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.880]   But building something like this wasn't easy.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:31.880]   No, look at it.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.920]   Over a hundred people volunteer their time, including sound designers from the biggest
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.000]   names in music and app developers who have sold hundreds of thousands of apps in the
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.040]   app store.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.160]   But why do we need this?
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.880]   There was something I learned that shocked me.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:50.120]   There's millions of people in the world with iPads that can't even afford five or ten
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.240]   dollars for a music app.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.920]   Millions of people receive free iPads from schools and other charity organizations.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.960]   Many don't even have credit cards, putting even a 99 cent app out of reach.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.120]   It's a humbling and exciting experience.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.880]   Matthew, this has been a labor of love with no financial sponsors.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:11.880]   We built this without any kick starters or any financial investors.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.160]   So many people worldwide have donated their time and effort to make this beautiful sounding
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.360]   app.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   The outpouring of support has been wonderful.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   You're right.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   We're so grateful.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.040]   Twelve thousand people have signed the mailing list.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.040]   It looks way good.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.040]   It comes out with the app.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.040]   Look at it.
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.040]   I can't.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.040]   Exactly.
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.040]   It is so deep.
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.040]   You keep on opening up things.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.040]   You can't get back up.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.400]   Let me make some music.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.400]   Get presets.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.480]   Oh, I got to give them presets are free, but you have to give them your email.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.480]   That's okay.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.560]   I don't mind giving them my email.
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.400]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.360]   They could read it.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   That's correct.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.640]   Bonus presets have been added to Bank A. Wow, that was easy.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640]   All right.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:58.280]   So you turn it up all the way and now I have a keyboard.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.240]   Here we go.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.240]   That's kind of cool.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240]   Tell me what to do.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240]   All right.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.240]   So I'm in the 80s already.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240]   But it's more of a.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.360]   Oh, oh, you just press it whole.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.200]   It's very 80s.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:26.280]   Wow, this is cool.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.200]   This is a reason to get an iPad, frankly.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.560]   Oh, I see.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.200]   Eyeliner and a rich, skinny tie.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.760]   It took so long to write it.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.200]   It's now not hip anymore.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.880]   Anyway, it is and you just keep on going and then you keep on playing with it and then
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:49.880]   you go, what?
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.320]   Like there's something there'll be something else.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.240]   But I see think giving this to your little daughter and letting your best with it is
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.240]   great.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.600]   Loved it with headphones with headphones.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.600]   Yes.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:06.560]   I'll be taking this to play along with the fireworks tomorrow.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.680]   But I literally I download it right before I got on a plane and I think I lost like two
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.320]   hours sitting there just like because there are so so many dials.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.600]   And you can just sit there and just kind of just goof around with it and play with it.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.160]   I haven't made anything that I would record.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:29.360]   But it's just an incredible amount.
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.360]   I mean, it is I cannot believe that it's free.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.600]   You know, and I think that.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.600]   Can you record?
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.240]   I mean, how did it going to be saved?
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.240]   I haven't tried.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:39.240]   So I guess literally it's like a game.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.240]   You can save the city.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.720]   It saves the wave saves the settings.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.800]   It'd be fun to save the.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.320]   I'm sure you can save the music.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:51.720]   But the but I think that all notes have been turned off.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.680]   Oh, she hit midi panic.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.800]   No, it might have been.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.640]   I like any synthesizer.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.480]   I could just hold one key and I was working.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   I restarted it.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   So that's really cool.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.800]   Anyway, really cool.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.800]   So that's free.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.800]   Amazing.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.200]   You should all I can say is that if you have an iPad run, don't walk.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200]   Just just go get it.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.200]   I mean, it doesn't cost you anything.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.200]   I get your kit.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.200]   Audio kit.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.200]   One.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.400]   And it's just it's just so much fun.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.160]   And you just kind of dig into it.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:29.240]   And I think every every kid should definitely have this, you know, on it just to kind of
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.920]   explore that process.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:36.160]   So we have had fun today, haven't we?
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.320]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.320]   I will tomorrow.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.120]   I will I will bring you a calling card and I will bend the bend the left corner.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.280]   What corner I bend.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:53.200]   I haven't decided two corners that I know that one of us shall be dead upon the morrow.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:36:00.320]   Oh, dear, ladies and gentlemen, that's Andy and not co I H and a T KO on the Twitter and

[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.640]   Yes.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.640]   G B H the competitor.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.640]   Cross town.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.600]   We're both just just because we're both public radio doesn't mean we can't hate each other.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.600]   They're wonderful.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.600]   They're wonderful.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600]   They're wonderful.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.600]   They're wonderful.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:20.600]   They're wonderful.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.600]   It's because Ben Brock Johnson's on the show regularly too.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   And he's at B you are.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   So it's great.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.080]   We got we got Boston public radio sewn up here at Twitter.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:34.320]   Great to have you always, Andy and he anywhere else you want to plug or talk about?
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.760]   Not yet, but maybe sometimes some something soon.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:41.400]   For his diner pictures on Flickr and the eye.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.480]   Alex Lindsay, you'll find him on the Twitter too.

[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.240]   Anything you got coming up?
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.760]   I am going to be on this awesome show this weekend called the new screen savers.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.760]   You're going to be my co host?
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.080]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.880]   So I'm I'm fishing out there for questions.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.600]   So if people have specific questions for me, probably video.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.400]   I will have my purple ball.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.400]   We'll play the problem Saturday.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.280]   We'll play the ball game and we've got some stuff we did some scanning and we took some
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.560]   behind the scenes photo video of that.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.120]   So we should have some fun stuff to show.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.600]   So it should be a good time.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.160]   Yeah, lots of fun.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.240]   Renee Richie when he's not playing Pokemon and by the way, both Renee and I have maxed
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.720]   out at 200 friends.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720]   Sorry.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.720]   Yes.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.280]   All right.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.960]   We are creating a waiting list.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.000]   However, it'll cause there's a Tennessee Williams play.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000]   Oh, many good.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   I have that.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:45.880]   He is at imore.com where he writes exclusively about Mac and iOS and Pokemon and anything
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.320]   else that a geek would be interested in.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.720]   And he does the vector podcast there as well.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.080]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:58.280]   I have a brand new video up about maps.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.560]   So if you go to YouTube.com/vector show, I'll tell you all about the new maps.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.440]   Understand all of the stuff we were talking about today.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440]   Why it matters.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.440]   Why it matters.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.360]   Well, I've got a wild gulp in to capture.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.360]   So do it.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.920]   I think this will be a time for me to say thank you all for joining us.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.720]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, right after iOS today.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.520]   That usually is around 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.920]   It'll be 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:27.160]   If you want to stop by, please do say hi.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.320]   You can also join us in the studio.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.520]   We had a nice studio audience up from Irvine visiting just email tickets at Twitch.com.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.760]   Twitch.tv will put a chair out for you.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:38.600]   The live feed is at Twitch.tv/live, the chatros.irc.tv.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:44.600]   And if you want to download audio or video of any of our shows, the website is Twitch.tv.

[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.920]   Just look for Mac break weekly.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:00.200]   That way you'll get it the minute it's available every Tuesday.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.600]   Thanks so much for watching.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.600]   We'll see you next time.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.200]   Now back to work, my friends, because as you know, break time is over.
