[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.720]   living in blueville today
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.640]   Yes, we're in the tran- we're in the transitional space of the office cleanup where the office is sparkling clean
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   But there are no like really nice
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.920]   Video lights and there are yes
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.480]   So you have to you have to deal with like the work like that I was using in the other room to sort socks and laundry
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.360]   I I dread the coming office cleanup from my office
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.480]   It has so many layers of mitten
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.560]   All the little all the stuff and I never so it's just a mess and the basement
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.680]   Oh
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.320]   You got it. Well, you got to do it. You got to do it
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.160]   It's I keep coming back to what Clemenza said to Michael Corleone in the in the first godfather
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640]   Like when there's gonna be this gang war so that's this kind of stuff has to happen
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.320]   How bad's it gonna be pretty damn bad, but you know this things got to happen every 10 years
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.200]   So it's not that it's not the bad blood. He's at the bad blood. Yeah. Oh, let's go to the mattresses
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.040]   Also, I will say that I found my oldest so far surviving
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   Mac T-shirt from 1991
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.920]   So I have a T I have a t-shirt that can run for Congress now
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.600]   And he's gonna be running for president sooner actually John
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.560]   I think there's an older t-shirt in my office in the those old tie-dye hippie
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.200]   I think it's a B much and I'm pretty sure it dates from the 80s my friends the 80s. That's Renee Richie
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   He's from I'm more
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.880]   Calm more or less and he's decided to live in the in the glow of the dying Sun apparently
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.480]   80 million years hence
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.520]   Here is my what Andy looked so cool. I decided to yeah, I like it some heat what what era is this?
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.160]   Yeah, that's that's like
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.960]   1990 it says a little bit be muggy t-shirt which stands for I think I can't I just group tie died in
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   Berkeley by deadheads I
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.120]   Would bring them with me but at the Apple
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.560]   Infinite Loop store right now. They have they always change up the designs of the t-shirts and this month they have three retro t-shirts
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.000]   They have the original Isaac Newton Apple logo. Oh the Susan care icons and the original Mac icon on white t-shirts
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.920]   And they look spectacular. Yeah, so you're in the area check them out. I'm gonna be so thank thank you so much
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.240]   I'm sure that the packages and transit where you bought each of those
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.920]   This is because why would I not want that you're gonna you're gonna be like the Canadian like t-shirt you were a new
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.400]   Which one should I wear should I wear that this is I'm pretty sure still a B mug is just doesn't say anything
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.880]   It's tied. I that's a beautiful tie dye gorgeous. Yeah, so is it true?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.760]   Are is Apple going to have to shut down FaceTime and messages again?
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.000]   Damage is award now a hundred and ninety million dollars
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.040]   Viernet X is it fair to call them a patent role? Yes, and he named you wish
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.680]   I mean they sued they
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.040]   It's one of those things where it's like a patent this in an adjacent area that is if loosely and broadly
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.200]   Interpreted in a certain district in Texas will allow them to get an easy verdict and a lot of money
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.680]   And it's caused a lot of chaos because Apple had to totally re-architect the way things like FaceTime worked and moving through relay servers
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.840]   When originally it was meant to be a peer-to-peer system that would be you know theoretically have fewer points of failure
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.360]   And Apple has kept appealing and they have kept
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.840]   Verdon Verdon X has kept winning
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.480]   Vernet X has kept winning and now they're asking a judge just to order Apple to shut the surfaces down because apparently that's
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.960]   That's something you can do in Texas Leo, or at least in the rocket doctor mom wants us to call him Ghanis
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   Which is some apparently some
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   Yiddish term that probably is filthy, but is the opposite of mentions? Yeah, this is a little tight
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.440]   I was a little more slender in those days
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.040]   Putting on the bemug shirt. Wow. I don't know if I can breathe but uh, so
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.680]   But the but okay, so they asked the court in Texas of course to to make Apple stop
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:56.720]   This is following their victory to the term of six hundred twenty five million dollars now they say they want Apple to stop
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.840]   offering FaceTime and messages and they want the
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   The penalty to be increased by a hundred
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.000]   90 million so that would make it in my careful calculations like
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.680]   cajillion dollars
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.320]   Yeah, it's Apple's got that much money in the cup holders of the new Apple car. Yeah, they could afford it, but the
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.200]   Yeah, it's a litigation that's painful. Yeah a 20 the state spec to a 2012 ruling
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   That was thrown out then tried again
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.520]   So I mean the US patent a trademark office has rejected the four patents
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.120]   It's I mean Apple can litigate this forever, but it is totally stopped development like for example FaceTime
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.400]   The development on that has totally stopped it Apple is in almost nothing with it except for re-architecting it in a way
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.760]   That is that caused a lot of problems for a lot of people
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:00.000]   And the scary thing is like I don't know what FaceTime and I message you're doing that most that the same patent couldn't be broadly interpreted for other instrument
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.640]   Instant messaging clients which something we've seen with patent rolls before as they go after a couple small targets
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.200]   Get some money go after a couple big targets try to get more money and then go after everybody
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.640]   So I just don't know how often we can keep seeing this Leo
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.720]   Yeah, that's one I've been hearings in the post Google I/O stuff
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   I've been hearing that one of the reasons why
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.120]   Google has keep has continued to update and do like revolutionary things with their messaging software is to shift from stuff that has
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.640]   Only bulletproof patent protection and make sure it has like Kryptonite protected protection
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.000]   And stuff that is absolutely that's been sort of like battle tested already because as as Renee implied
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.840]   It's it's so it's almost like you're building a spacecraft every time you want a company like Apple or Google or Facebook wants to introduce a new
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.840]   Technology they have to make sure that the patent that the patents are absolutely 100% airtight
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.360]   And that doesn't mean like with the Samsung trial making sure you didn't copy from anybody else
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.720]   It means that I have to know if I have if I'm using this system
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.600]   Where did this first idea come from and who owns the IP from that and if I'm including this code library from here
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.560]   Where did that code library from come from?
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.880]   It's not about like making sure that people don't
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.040]   Developers don't get screwed over it's making sure that if there is just that little bit of wiggle in the in the in the patent
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.860]   That's that's where somewhat a patent role can get in and really cause trouble
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.920]   We often complain about how you know a company they don't Apple doesn't get it
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.560]   They're not improving FaceTime. They're not keeping up and that what Renee says is tracks with what I've been hearing that
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.960]   It's not it's there's a lot there's a lot of implications to Apple moving forward with FaceTime and they've been frustrated by
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.240]   Things that have nothing to do with technology
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.720]   Yeah, and it's so hard to see because you know Andy's point is spot on but we saw a bunch of developers sued over in-app purchases on a patent based on
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.440]   Fax machines, which I think is almost impossible for anybody to predict
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:56.000]   But it was allowed to continue and it was small amounts because they figure people will just pay out and it helps them build their war
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.120]   Chest and I don't know. I don't know what we can do now. Here's a patent from a non
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.760]   patent role at least a an entity that has a little more clout than Viren edX Caltech
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   Yeah, also suing over Apple says by the way, we're the number one target of patent trolls
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.440]   Caltech says it has a patent for Wi-Fi chips and and
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:26.920]   The Wi-Fi chips in Apple's technology, which I'm sure Apple doesn't make their own Wi-Fi chips as far as I know they don't
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.440]   I don't say ships them
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.280]   You know the Broadcom is also being sued
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:40.800]   They Broadcom creates the Wi-Fi chips in the iPhone and the MacBook and other Apple products in fact Broadcom creates the Wi-Fi chips in pretty much every computer
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.280]   I've ever seen Intel does some Wi-Fi chips, but almost all my my dales all have Broadcom chips
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.240]   And how can these not be friend?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.160]   I mean and that's the thing is that a ton of ways they don't sue immediately
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.080]   They wait for a while until the technology is embedded in everything and then seal but usually the fair
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.040]   Reasonable and non-discriminatory access rules
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.520]   Which means that if you want your technology to be included in a standard that everybody uses you have to agree to make those patents easily
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.040]   accessible to everybody who uses it other you know those two things are are very different priorities
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:15.600]   You know I really I mean it's a really a lawsuit against Broadcom which creates the chips and the patents good date
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.680]   2006 and 2012 there for 802.11 and 802.11 AC so their recent technologies that
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.400]   I'll quote allow for faster data transmissions and quote while simplifying the hardware
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.280]   so
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   You know sometimes these are legit and Apple probably is just in there because they have deep pockets
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.080]   They're like everybody else using Broadcom's chips
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.000]   All right
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.640]   Yeah, I know we won't do anymore of that because that's boring
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.160]   And still and innovating it's and it's it is I feel the life sucked out of me right now exactly
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   Thank God. I'm wearing a be mug tie-dye shirt because that that pushes life it's invigorating
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.800]   So they're figurating that shirt on your at least 15 percent stone
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.280]   And arguing to be eight for seventeen it does have a little patchouli
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.240]   fragrance
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   left over
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.160]   Thun okay, so WWDC just around the corner thunderbolt stock
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.560]   Limited for the thunderbolt displays at Apple stores
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.840]   Usually that means perhaps something new is coming along and they Apple hasn't updated its displays in a long time, right?
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.640]   They're waiting on thunderbolt 3 which is also rumored to be shipping
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:41.120]   So with is thunderbolt 3 a downward compatible so if I had a new MacBook
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.240]   Pro with thunderbolt 3 on it. Could I use an old thunderbolt display? Yes, right? Yes
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.800]   Could I okay next question?
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.480]   Could I use a thunderbolt 3 display with an old MacBook Pro go the other way?
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.440]   I guess it would depend on what the display supported because you need the three to push the amount of bandwidth that you
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.360]   For a 5k display for example
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.920]   So if the 5k display whatever resolution it supports if it does support low resolutions
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.280]   You'll be able to drive it as a low-res monitor, but not not at anything approaching the 5k more at least one uk
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.600]   Apple store reports stock of those thunderbolt monitors didn't run out but was returned to the warehouse
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.200]   So that will
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.920]   also airport extreme and time capsules
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   Out of stock at many apple stores
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.720]   Although 9 to 5 max saying that could be because of a recent firmware update or an fcc compliance issue
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.320]   But we did hear rumors weren't they didn't mean that they were going to update the airport extreme
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.560]   Isn't it they might be due because they were yeah, they last updated them at wwc a couple years ago
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   They introduced that tower design are they they do have a c airport extreme
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.160]   So they're at least up to the latest 802.11 standard
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.880]   So but it would make sense new displays new 5k cinema display. Do they still call them cinnamon displays?
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.320]   Apple underbolt displays underbolt displays the 5k thunderbolt would be really nice
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.560]   It would also be a really good gift to the pro community that's feeling a little bit short-trifted right now
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   They of course the difficulty is that it's not like having the old cinema displays where you could simply plug it into pretty much
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.400]   Anything the product line
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.000]   Driving a 5k display is a very very special thing that would require kind of like the best CPUs. Yeah, we get yeah
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.680]   But so that's the that if they are if we are thinking about apple introducing a 5k thunderbolt display
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.000]   The implication would be that there is hardware coming that's going to support it as well. That's not necessarily a mac pro
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.520]   I just bought and I don't know how many use it. It's kind of impractical a 43 inch Dell display
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   That's 4k. It has it's 1080
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.960]   P times 2 times 4 so
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.320]   You could have the idea is it has four inputs. Are you carrying it over here, john?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.520]   Yeah, john is actually carrying it over here and an underlay of amazing
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.400]   Manly fortitude a display of unusual size. This thing. Yeah, look at the size of that. Huh? Yeah, oh it eclipses andy
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.480]   I don't know if you really you want us. That's a tanning bed. It's a tanning bed
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.480]   Wow. Yeah, my gosh much looks so good on that but it has four inputs so you could in theory
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.240]   I think it's really more for it's especially modern for day traders and stuff who want people who want like rocket launchers
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.960]   Super villains. You could run your super villain here
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.040]   Uh because you could put four computers on it. You could have four 1080p displays on it
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.320]   I don't know what I'm gonna do with it. I think well, I think a lot of people
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.440]   Ignore how much their computing experience can be changed by just swapping out to a really good display on a really good
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.960]   Like monitor arm. I just I actually my my dull display here isn't even particularly good. It's a
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.080]   It's really really good. It's a 350 display
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.440]   It supports all the video modes, but it's not like super elegant
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.000]   But the fact that now it's plugged into my macbook has changed how I use my macbook
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.120]   The fact that now I have for the first time a screen is attached to a $200 monitor arm
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.200]   And now I can move it exactly wherever I want it to go has this is one as I'm
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   Emptying up my office and rebuilding my office. It's well here all the different screens
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.520]   I didn't need anymore because now I have this screen that I can park direct
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:15.920]   I can move it directly behind my camera when I'm when I'm podcasting or I can move it low when I'm doing it this where I can have it
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.120]   Down over here when I need to be a second monitor for this other computer over here
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.560]   So a lot of people if they're thinking about budgeting $500 to $2,000 for a new mac
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.200]   Oftentimes you might find that if you just spend a thousand dollars improving just
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.720]   Where you're sitting how you're sitting what you're typing on and what you're looking at
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.000]   That's that's an even better way of improving how your office works
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.600]   Maybe a better way to spend the same amount of money would be to buy what we bought for the ultimate virtual reality gaming machine
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   Which is one of these 34 inch
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.160]   21 9
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.240]   Yeah curved monitors that that's about 13 or 8. Yeah, it looks so good
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.360]   Yeah
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.760]   And that and that I I would love to see apple and I I wouldn't be surprised everybody's selling them now
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.480]   Uh, I wouldn't be surprised to see apple make one of these. This is I can't remember which one we bought
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.480]   Uh, but this is the lg
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.840]   Um
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.760]   And would you need this is thunderbolt? I don't know if it's thunderbolt three, but this is thunderbolt
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.040]   I don't know if you'd need thunderbolt for a three to uh to drive it, but it is it is these are gorgeous
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.480]   Yeah
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:21.040]   And uh, and I think these are a little more practical than then stacked 4k the idea of going super wide
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.440]   Yeah, I mean depends on people don't like turning their heads some people don't like looking up and down
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.920]   So there's I guess your reality traits. Yeah
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.680]   And they let's see this this is the lg has two
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.160]   display port
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.920]   A good indicator for apple is what they did on the iMacs if we look back a few years introduced the ips panel on this on the last
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.440]   My iMac redesign and when they had a good amount of the iMacs on market
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.480]   They brought out the new thunderbolt display with the same panels
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   Right at the current iMac and it's 5k panel, especially now that it's high dent
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   It's uh
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.880]   what an ip
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.480]   IP three rated for color gamut. It's a good indicator that that's probably the panel we'll see in the next underbolt as well
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:05.520]   Is there any indication in os 10 about what aspect ratio it's it it's supporting any aspect ratio
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.880]   Probably yeah, we plugged that 43 inch into my
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   uh
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   2012 macbook and it worked fine
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.800]   And I don't know what the resolution was it was very high resolution, but it worked fine
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.880]   Could you read it leo or did you have to scale it up?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.600]   No, it does. Hi. I love high dpi apple inventives
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.680]   Everybody's doing it now, but apple invented it and for their retina displays and
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.240]   Uh, we do we totally need that. I don't know how well others do it the way apple does it is beautiful, which is they they
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.160]   They use half the res half the native resolution, but they take the extra pixels
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:45.840]   And they do uh, they do anti aliasing so it really looks super crisp and there's smart enough to let the content be native resolution
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.080]   So that's the image. Yeah, it's full res. That's the key for me
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.760]   I think that the real cell of apple displays is just the quality of the image where you get this super high contrast display
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.240]   Uh, whenever i'm testing out a screen. It's always with uh, one of the probably the first godfather movie the first of the opening scene
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.000]   So dark
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.120]   It's not it's not just not only is it like halfway shadows. There's supposed to be detail in the shadows
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.480]   Right
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.280]   Decent screen you will see blacks and you'll you'll see you'll see a tuxedo where you can see like
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.480]   Highlights on the lapels on a really bad screen you won't see the high on the on the lapels
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.400]   But on a really really good screen you will see that there is wrinkles and there's lights and there's things like that happening
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.680]   Uh, and with uh with apple displays just things are so much crisper so much more more detailed
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   There are times when even the difference between uh, doing like a photoshop thing
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.920]   Uh here on my on my desktop here
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:46.320]   I will actually have my ipad as a second display so that if I want to if I really really want to see how good this
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   Possibly can be I will drag the window into the ipad because it really is the highest quality of display that uh, that I have in the house
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   Yeah
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.080]   I don't mean I don't know if they I think really that's really you you nailed it
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.880]   Which is that people and people pay a premium for an apple display
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.000]   But if you're a photographer a videographer for if you somebody who needs an accurate
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.080]   display
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.080]   I think that's one of the few features that really uh, uh improves everybody's lives
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.440]   It's not until you go back to let you let's say that you're you're you're using your your macbook
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.400]   And you're watching videos or you're just on the web or you're just looking at your own photos
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   And then you help your kid with their homework and they have a school issued 300 dollar samson chrome book
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.520]   And you see oh my god. I'm looking at the same pictures
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.680]   I was looking at on my macbook, but
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.240]   It doesn't look like in any way that I don't want to be staring at this for three or four hours
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.760]   And I feel like i'm going to be hauled off to child by child protective services by making my kid use this display
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.760]   Yeah, the first time I saw the 5k display at the event I felt like it was better than reality like I would fall into it
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:54.240]   I just not want to leave isn't it really good individually calibrating them and the color management technology through their whole
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.640]   Device stack make sure that you know what you see is pretty much what you get going through the whole thing
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.400]   How funny how you used to it you get though because I remember when I first got my 5k iMac
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.000]   I was like amazed and a couple of days later. It's just my computer
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.520]   Then you look at a regular display and the pixel is so big you feel them cutting your eyes
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.240]   Sand I think sandpaper is this
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   I gotta say that that's for me. That's more of a change when i'm going from one macbook to the other
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.320]   It's one of the reasons why I can't deal with a 13 inch macbook air
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:28.240]   But on my desktop given that there's going to be like a foot to 18 inches of distance
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.280]   I certainly don't mind it at all and much rather have a higher quality lower resolution display than a 4k display
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.160]   It's I can certainly see the difference, but it's not that that's sort of retina burning the
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.120]   This difference that I get on laptop displays
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.400]   I'm kind of stuck because once you buy the 5k iMac you have to use its I mean you I guess you could
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:55.120]   Put it in the corner and face away from you and drive other monitors, but you kind of want to use its display, right?
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:02.720]   So uh if you want to get so what I have is uh two of my older cinema displays and either 24 inch cinema displays on either
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.160]   27 inch cinema displays on either side and then the mac in the middle
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.560]   And i'm really stuck. There's not really I can't that's one of the reasons that 43 inch
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.880]   I'm kind of wondering well, what am I going to do with it? I can't i'm not going to attach it to my 5k iMac
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.720]   That wouldn't be a good idea
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.480]   I have a couple of friends who put a vertical 4k panels on either side of their
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.720]   my magnets play
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.000]   Yeah, this one all the pixels. I've seen that too. So sideways so you get the portrait mode
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.240]   Yeah, that is like ears on your
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   glass game
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.560]   Actually the first time I saw a friend a developer who had that that display it really felt like
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.520]   As a kid going to mass every sunday what the way they had the way that they have the stained glass behind the altar
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.640]   Yeah, they have like oh, it's a trip to vertical pads a trip to
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.080]   Yeah
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.040]   The last stations of the cross in the middle there's to be a different case or something
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   I like it and then that's getting me now is the high
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.760]   The high dynamic range sorry where they have better color because once you start seeing the better color
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.080]   That to me is much more impressive than a lot of like the 3d fads or things that we had for a I agree
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.640]   Do we have any HDR monitors yet?
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.320]   It's the slow slow process so right now the new iMacs have that p3 color gamut
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.600]   So it does have a wider range of colors and there's some
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.920]   I forget the name of the company with this LG is doing a high dynamic range monitor
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.800]   Television set and there's a couple other I think Vizio has 120 thousand dollar version, but also a 6 thousand dollar version
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:34.240]   We actually i'm trying to I think the one that we have for the ultimate virtual reality game machine is the Acer predator
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.680]   Nice
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.400]   Twelfth but 13 hundred bucks and it's it really looks beautiful question from the chat room
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:48.800]   I'll open it either one of you guys do you need to calibrate the the apple 5k iMac or does it come to your home
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.200]   Kind of ready to go it comes calibrate. Yeah, sorry any
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.760]   We're about to the same thing. Yeah, it comes calibrated as a matter of fact most new monitors even third parties
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.320]   I've seen the the cheap ones are not calibrated the ones that look the same but they cost like 80 dollars more for instance
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.080]   Well, typically you're buying a calibrated monitor that will come with a sheet of paper
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.400]   Here is the here is the here is the the test sheet on this here's how it was calibrated with the specs of this actual screen are
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.560]   but if you're a pro you probably have
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.640]   a
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.080]   Whatever they call that photo retinometer or something that you put on the this I call them screen suckers
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.400]   Yeah, they put on the spiders the spiders you put on the screen and calibrated create your own color profile apple really
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.160]   Created that whole thing in the earliest days because they were doing a lot of prepress
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.360]   They were the first matching they were first to do that weren't they?
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.480]   Yeah, and some people do like if you if you really work in a business where you need precise color matching
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.600]   Over time, then you probably want to check it. You know, you might have your you might be doing it on a monthly basis and then six months
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   Yeah, absolutely. I mean things do change and you might change profiles for some project or another
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.800]   So uh if you're in that business though, I assume you have spiders hanging off your monitor pretty much every day. Yeah. Yeah
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   Yeah
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.320]   And also when you change the lighting in your office you also need to
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:08.640]   Re-check that calibration because and also your eyes happen to change from month to month and year to year sometime
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.600]   So
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   If you're if it's in how I want true tone
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.880]   Yeah, exactly
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.000]   If you're in the business of I had this idea that uh
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.080]   Because I go to I go to a lot of like big commerce conventions and I've always thought about you
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.400]   I'd love to do cosplay but I don't know what I would go as
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.200]   cosplay really
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.160]   Because it's like you look as your ambition
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:37.600]   I'm so my ambition is actually to have as much fun over the course of one day as

[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.360]   I'm having a great time too, but it seems as though it's they're having a good time that's different from me taking pictures
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.960]   But I I have this idea that I'm going I'm going to make a suit
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.280]   That's that's made out of exactly 50% neutral gray
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.840]   And like printed versions of the standard like color calibration test card
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.920]   And I'm gonna everyone's gonna want to take my picture because that will be like oh my god
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:10.160]   If I just simply start with the start with in light room by just calibrating based on the the this this one person's jacket and pants
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.240]   Every other picture taken in the same location left perfectly balanced color

[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   Do we always see any vr or any any even a tip of the hat to vr at ww
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.040]   DC? I mean everybody else is showing their thing him cook with the apple helmet
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.200]   Give the apple helmet
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   You know apple would make it look better, right?
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.000]   It would somehow
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.840]   It's so interesting to me because apple waited 10 years to get into phones and to get into tablets
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.080]   But the only way that a few years to get into watches
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.760]   You know arguably they didn't have as much time to observe other people and sort of figure out a
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.840]   A really sharp product going in but it was nice that they were involved in the early stages
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.720]   Because we've all got to spend a year, you know growing with the apple watch
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.920]   So do they do the same thing in vr do they watch the oculus and the htc vibe and the galaxy gear and do they figure out?
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.880]   You know it right now. It's not a mainstream product for the really good ones
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.640]   You need a super powerful pc
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.280]   You've got wires coming out of your head you got a big helmet on is that a product apple would bring to market not
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.560]   Traditionally they might wait until there's better batteries and they're more portable and they're more elegant devices
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.120]   But that's what I find so exciting about this is now with the watch you know would app would apple get into this so early
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.520]   Oh, it'll say
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.360]   Consider the fact that uh apple is able to do something is different with the iphone
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.080]   Uh because they right now apple has iphone money
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.560]   Yeah, they didn't write phone. They didn't have that phone
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:56.320]   So they also kind of had to wait five years to figure out what they what where they want to take their shot
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.160]   Now they really have the ability to say with this this is our version of vr
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.960]   Just as they could say this is our version of of a watch
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.320]   And we are going to we are going to be the company that takes three or five years to get it
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.920]   Exactly where we want it to go and to wait for the mainstream users to come around to our way of thinking
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:17.440]   So, uh, there's definitely been a lot of movement in vr an apple particularly in the past year and a half
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.640]   Whether they're going to have something to announce at ww dc. I i'm not sure
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.280]   because the difference between
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:31.440]   Having something that looks like it's pointing towards a real thing and having even an api little own hardware that they can ship
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.680]   Is a really big thing
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.160]   I think it requires a certain amount of strategy that they haven't decided upon yet
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.280]   And they're also they're not they're not so self-conscious about themselves that the fact that
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:49.760]   The android side of things is doing so much of moving forward in vr and they're not is going to they're not going to lose any sleep
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.880]   Over that whatsoever. Yeah, wonder if apple might just recuse themselves in this one or leave that just say
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   We'll leave it to you guys
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.080]   Is the helmet the product? I mean, that's one of the big questions is right now
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:06.480]   The obvious application for vr is a headset that you can use for entertainment and video gaming and apple doesn't do that right apple don't care
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.240]   No, it's it's not a apple doesn't care about chipsets that care about feature sets and maybe it's as simple as apple vr
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.040]   Is all going to be about the heads up display in the apple car or about windows that turn into you know
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.400]   The big you make you forget the highway and think you're driving through Jurassic park
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.200]   I mean there's all sorts of applications right now. We don't even think about
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.440]   LCD or led or OLED is a technology. It's just it's the screens around us
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.320]   It's in our watches and our phones and maybe we saw it
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.800]   We saw people that do basically person in the middle attacks on the photons going into our eyes as a way to give us virtual reality images
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:42.000]   So it's totally it's totally exciting technology, but there could be very very different ways that it manifests itself
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.640]   Sure apple pay more attention to gaming historically. It's never been a great game platform
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.560]   Thanks to steam at least you can you know, there's some games, but they've always been kind of
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   You know an afterthought for game
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.400]   Developed I don't think it's a game that they can win the way that it's being won by other platforms
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:07.600]   They they I think that they're in a great position to win the platform of casual gaming like people on mobile. They're doing great
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.800]   Yeah, exactly people who want to play puzzle games people who want to play like arcade style vintage games
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.960]   They are not going to be able to fight the fight where you have these people who are willing to spend
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.360]   $800 per month at least on their gaming because they will not be able to sell the sort of hardware
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.120]   Where someone can spend $4,000 and essentially have shuttle launch capability from their living room
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.720]   And that's when you when you talk about someone needs to be able to drive a 4k display at 60 frames per second with zero latency
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.800]   Apple would have to create an entire new company version of themselves
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.480]   Just to get that to the market and they're those the people who buy that sort of stuff
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:50.000]   They don't really care about the the the kind of aluminum that's used to create the cooling bridge for the cpu
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.600]   They just want the frame rate. So it's it's not a market that I think apples well suited
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.760]   So maybe this just not gonna be they're not gonna
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.040]   Yeah, it's not a failure the fact that they're not in a certain market
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   Not a big deal that they're failing a thing exactly
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.080]   So if they stayed out of the wearables market if they stay out of the VR market
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.920]   That doesn't mean that anybody is passing them by there's there have been some people who have been I think a little bit too impressed by the google
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.200]   I/O announcements saying the ball. Where is apples? Where's apples?
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:20.640]   Artificial intelligence where's apples natural language processor that's moving beyond Siri? They can do very very well for themselves and
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:27.280]   Even create new ground ahead of themselves without getting into the same spaces that everyone else is getting into
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.920]   And that's despite the fact that other people are doing really wonderful work in VR
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.880]   So it's not a failure for them not to not to be other with the markets that don't personally interest them and who knows in five years
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:44.720]   They may look back and said oh we dodged a bullet that VR thing really was always the time. Yeah, I think that's completely possible, right?
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.680]   I think about that year at the what I went to
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:55.440]   A mobile world congress in Barcelona and it seemed as though one out of every five phones had some sort of 3d lens
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.680]   Set up on it. Yes, and it's like even then you could say that okay. That's a nice gimmick
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:08.640]   It's a it's a nice party trick if you're at the bar to try to impress a person of yours of your approved
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.680]   Target gender with this wonderful feature of your phone that will be a nice feature
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.520]   But it went nowhere after about a year. I again clean out the office
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.480]   It really is like archaeology like in certain drawers and clauses where I hit the box where I put all the stuff
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.560]   Had all the stuff from like 2009 or whatever of like all the lg
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:36.720]   And samsung devices that were sent but they didn't want back because they canceled them after like two or three months
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.240]   So I have like a collection of android 2.2 tablets that take really really wonky 3d pictures
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:47.200]   That you can't really do with anything and it it really is one of those aussie mandias look upon my works
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:53.680]   You might even despair sort of things. Do you think rene is fair to say that apple knows who it is
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:01.040]   And what it is and uh, it's I mean, I think under steve jobs apple knew what it was it steve jobs company
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.000]   But now that apple does know who it is and is and is comfortable enough in their role to say yeah
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.520]   We're not going to chase the gaming market. We're not going to chase the vr market
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:14.000]   Yeah, uh steve jobs. Absolutely did that and tim cook has done that very well as as well
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.600]   Horace did you coined it the tim cook doctrine where he said that they look at markets and they have the luxury of
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.240]   A lot of money so they can investigate and prototype the heck out of these markets
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.800]   But they really want to make sure that they enter markets
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:34.560]   With a lot of thought as to how they can make a difference and for apple that means that they can deploy a product at scale that helps make that product
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.480]   Mainstream and accessible to on the market in a way that it's never been done before
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.120]   And even if it's a super interesting technology if they can't do those things if they can't meet those criteria
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.960]   They're happy to say no
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.320]   They said a thousand knows forever. Yes, and that means they literally have to try
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.720]   Like a thousand different labs and experiments and prototypes to figure out that one thing
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.880]   They're going to ship like a watch or like a maybe a car one day and there's a lot of things
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.800]   They never ship like television sets and that's that's core to their culture
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   I mean people told them if they didn't do netbooks they'd be done if they didn't do this or that device they'd be done
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:11.280]   People now I have friends who have you know HTC Vive or oculus and they're like this is so compelling if apple doesn't do this
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.640]   They're done this one's different, but everyone is different and I think apple
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:21.200]   For me the concerning part with apple is when when and if they ever did become reactionary and just start throwing out unfinished products
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.360]   To sort of keep up with what everybody else is doing
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   I think you're right. I think that uh, I think that that's something very hard to do even in a company this small
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.920]   It's hard to look at something that says that who we are is that something we want to pursue or not?
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.480]   And I think yes fomo fear of missing out and I think if you're if you look at google or microsoft
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.440]   They clearly have difficult time saying oh no, we're not gonna do that. They know I just know you agree
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.680]   I totally I totally disagree with that. Yeah, there's a difference between uh calling your shots
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.400]   with a great amount of deliberation and precision and
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:02.320]   Wanting to explore an unfinished product or
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.360]   At some point every great idea is a lump a lump a clay
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.080]   Right and you got to start flacking at it and you can't and because like all art
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.360]   Technology is not just the thing itself
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.080]   It's the interaction between that thing and its audience and its user a play is no good
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.720]   If you write it and then go through ten edits and rehearse it and then don't actually put in front of an audience
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:31.600]   I I like apple and google for separate reasons what I like about google is that they're gonna take those risks
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.800]   They're gonna say we we this idea of having a phone that is made in components
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.920]   That people can simply snap together in and out as they like we don't know if there's anything to this idea
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.280]   But it's an interesting idea. Let's try to make it and the first
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.880]   10,000 people who buy it are not going to be mainstream buyers
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.560]   They're going to be people who are fascinated by this idea and are willing to suffer a little
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.000]   Along with us or the developers to see how well this works
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.680]   And maybe it will turn out to be nothing
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.400]   But we will learn a lot of stuff and we will become bigger and stronger and happier in our lives in our jobs by having
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.600]   Done this experimental stuff and failed. Um, there is there's an argument to me
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.160]   There's there are companies that will literally like
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.400]   Samsung is based on the idea of we are a manufacturing company. We are not a producer of electronics or home home
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.760]   Entertainment stuff. We are a manufacturer of things
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.680]   And if there's a thing that we can manufacture we're gonna do that and try to sell it
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.400]   They really are let's throw everything against the wall and whatever sticks. We will make a version 2.0 of that
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.240]   That's not what google does. I think google just likes to experiment
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.480]   They are a university where they like to do research
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.240]   Even they they've they've had a little bit of a turnaround in the last year and a half
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.120]   We're now
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:48.320]   Famously the new under the new reorganization there has to be a plan in place where we will give you two years to screw around with this idea
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.960]   But a couple of years after that you have to give us a product we can sell to regular people
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.200]   But it says it says nothing it says nothing bad about them that they are they they did google glass
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.400]   And you don't see google glass on one out of every three faces
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.800]   Because they learned the things they learned out of google glass
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:09.680]   They are putting into all the new intelligent things they're doing right now that they're they're putting into the design of android 5 and 6
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   And they learn from it. I would like to see apple do more things that tell us
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.360]   Don't don't just show us things that you think will change the world
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.000]   Show show us things that you think are a wonderful waste of time
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   I would love to see the first product that I'd like to if they had their 20% thing where you are allowed to do
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:37.760]   It's spent 20% of your time one out of every three years doing something profoundly silly and wonderful that you're excited about
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.560]   And I would like to see a half hour of every
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:47.600]   Every public event given over to at least three of these wonderfully heroically silly but incredible ideas
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.000]   Google pays a little bit of a price though for that looking like they're
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Dilitantish and and willing to cancel stuff even if somebody likes it
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.360]   Every the comments. Yeah, it's well. I feel that way whether it's a I mean
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.440]   I don't have to look at somebody's comments to feel that way
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.280]   I'm a little gun shy whenever google announces a new product about jumping on it because I've been burnt so many times
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.080]   So there is a consequence to doing that. I agree. There's something beneficial to doing it
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.800]   It's just to make people who are doing it
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.200]   Yeah
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.920]   We benefit from having both approaches like the googles and the samsongs will put a lot of things in the field and then apple will take
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.120]   It's time mostly will take its time and put out a very coherent version of it
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   It doesn't have all the features but apple could not
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.520]   Do what they do without all the market research done by the companies who do go to market faster
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.720]   And a lot of what people will say this companies copying this or that from apple
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.280]   That's the return price they pay apple does the research and comes up with a very simplified version
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.320]   And then that informs the next iterations of those products and it's incredibly
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.240]   It's an incredibly symbiotic relationship and when you say apple should do that like you know
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.280]   Andy's doing it very rationally
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.720]   But some people just say apple has to do moonshots or google has to learn to focus that that's not how those cultures work
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.680]   It's sort of like saying rene has to have everything in his house that Andy has in his house
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.280]   We're very different everything about us is different and that's reflected in how we work
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.680]   And it's good that we have these these sort of differences
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.240]   And johnny i've like he once said and I thought it was a really good statement and johnny i've actually like he talks
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.280]   The way talks on video that's just that's just johnny i've was that you know
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.600]   He can create all these products and he can put them out on market
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.080]   But it's not until he sees how people use and interact with them that they become real that he starts to
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.640]   Understand what they mean and then they iterate from there
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   And that's the same approach. They just sort of take it a little bit further down the line of where they see the product before they introduce it
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.160]   So both approaches i think are super valuable for us as consumers
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.360]   So it's probably safe to say that this is not in apple's future the back pack
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.280]   Computer
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   This is uh one of the lab now
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.680]   Then one of the many computers being shown at competex in the type eight today
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.960]   These are designed for virtual reality helmets. It's a computer you wear on a backpack
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.800]   What if we do a case mask? What looks like the rocket here is rocket
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   It kind of does
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.160]   And then I would definitely go this is the hp omen x
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.880]   Omen my friends the it's a pc uh vr pc
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.840]   This is a development kit. That's actually the omen is pretty nice. This is the msi
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:16.560]   Uh, uh, no vga ports tuned. No, it's all all hdmi because of course it's designed for using with a five
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.880]   I imagine so no, but imagine this like ruggedized made out of
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:27.920]   But like a panasonic tuff book and imagine an architect a building a building director and a couple investors
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.600]   Walking through an empty field and saying here is where here is what the complex is going to look like
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.840]   In our virtual reality. How about on?
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.120]   Let's walk from the parking lot to the main building. Oh actually, you know what?
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.360]   I really love that clump of trees over there. Why don't we just walk around the trees instead of driving?
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.680]   I'm saying it's I love technology at this stage is invigorating because you could do anything with it
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.080]   Nobody there there has not been the rule books set yet that if you want to make money with a virtual reality rig
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.440]   Here's what here are the people who are buying it and so here is what they want you to make
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.880]   With it. It's like no you can just think that wouldn't be nice if we could do this wouldn't be nice to
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:12.160]   I'm sure that artists and sculptors have not been saying I wish I could spend five thousand dollars for a magic one so that I could do
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   3d
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:20.480]   Emmett 3d sculptures made out of light that I have to be wearing a three thousand dollar thing on my face to even see and I can't display it anywhere
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.720]   But let's build that right now since it's no one buying it. Let's build it
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:31.360]   It will be awesome and the people who get to use it will get so excited by this technology that they'll have ideas of their own
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.320]   And 10 years from now the people who are ancient and old because now they're 40 instead of 30
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.280]   Will not be able to imagine what the 20 year olds are coming up with when they they start to have their minds
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:47.440]   Warped by this from an early early age. This is this is why virtual reality is incredibly wonderful not because it's commercial
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:54.800]   But because it is just a grove of trees and we're about to set off in front of there and we could find damn near anything inside that that forest
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:02.320]   Uh, I love this article ben einstein who is a product designer and now a vc at bolt vc
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.400]   No, you can't manufacture that like apple does a word of warning the startups hardware startups
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:15.600]   Who say, you know, we want to do it just like apple does he says apple can do it because because they're apple
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:21.920]   apple is an exception to nearly every rule he says what happened when apple wanted a cnc
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:29.360]   Uh machine a million macbook bodies a year those aluminum, you know, unibodies they bought 10 000
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.520]   Cnc machines to do it when they wanted to drill laser holes and macbook pros for the sleeplight
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.800]   But only one company made a machine that could drill those 20 micrometer holes in aluminum
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.040]   It bought the company and took all the inventory. So he said here's what you should as a startup
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.160]   Don't be putting this in your pitch deck kids white plastic. No
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:59.040]   White is often the most difficult color to mold if you need to use white you never have two separately molded white on white parts
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.240]   Even apple learned this when they wanted to make a white iPhone member was delayed
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.920]   Because they they but then they solved it right and just because apple has doesn't mean you can
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:15.680]   Cnc machining at scale. It's fantastic for prototypes pretty awesome for high margin parts like hip implants and turbine blades
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.240]   Not for consumer devices figure out a way to cast your metal parts
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   Don't look at them what apple's doing. Don't look at don't don't look at that
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.440]   Laser drilled holes invisible laser drilled holes are far more difficult to make than it may seem
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.920]   You can usually accomplish a similar looking field without the complex secondary operation if you're willing to sacrifice a bit
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:42.880]   Molded plastic packaging harder and more expensive than you might think recycled cardboard is your friend
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.360]   No ejector pin marks unless you're a billionaire genius
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.680]   Your product will have noticeable ejector pin marks
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.200]   Apple does it
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.880]   Don't but embrace the it breaks the marks my friends most consumers don't know what the hell an injector pin mark is anyway
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.040]   But this is my favorite one
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.680]   four color double walled matte boxes with HD foam inserts
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.440]   Yep
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   Of course apple's boxing is amazing
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.760]   You don't even want to throw them away. He says I know you're gonna do this anyways, but be prepared
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.520]   These kinds of boxes will literally be the most expensive line item on your build of materials
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.000]   It's not unusual for them to cost upward of $12 each
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.320]   at scale at scale and then they get thrown away
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.800]   I love this
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   No disagreement. I imagine from either of you
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.440]   No, it's points
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:43.200]   Apple's apple's probably because that's really part of their brand this part of the experience of owning an apple product and but and
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.760]   It's and it's not as though
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.800]   Any of the competing makers are wrong by putting a headphone jack
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:58.400]   In a in a device or having an eject hole because people don't necessarily people are not going to make a buying decision based on oh my god
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.880]   That look look at that sim and ejector pinhole like I most I almost want to throw up on the device and we actually improve it
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.000]   But nonetheless there is a and yeah
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.160]   I have a pile of boxes that are worthy of keeping it
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:21.040]   Apple boxes are I I found myself holding this thing and say am I really going to do this?
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:27.760]   It's not just not just the box that my apple watch came in but the protective outer car
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:34.000]   Like a brown cardboard box that was that that the box was shipped in is in itself
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.720]   One of the best plain cardboard recyclable brown boxes I've ever seen
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.880]   It's I I'm not joking when I say that I would love to spend if I had a choice between
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.960]   five the five apple executives and
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.920]   Just whoever it is who's in charge of designing and arranging apple boxes
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.800]   I can if you name the top five apple executives
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:02.080]   I think that I would say no to two of them if I could get a get an hour with the with a box designer instead
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.440]   Johnny Johnny starts it starts with Johnny right
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.000]   And it started actually with Steve who said let's let's really pay attention to this
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.760]   And they have an incredible Markham's department that does a lot of that stuff really that's a marketing
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   Yeah, of course it is right
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   You hold you hold the box upside down
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.440]   About like no pressure or no pressure on the sides really no pressure on the bottom
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.600]   And there's such a tight seal that they're not get out of it. It will not open
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.120]   And even when you see oh here it is it's about to fall
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.440]   All that happened was that like one edge of it like shifted maybe two millimeters
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.240]   But the the tolerance is so tight that now that one millimeter made it jam now and it will
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   Oh my goodness. I have so much respect for
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.480]   Putting so much work into something that someone is gonna save
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.160]   But they're not going to really be interacting with it 60 times a day like they are with
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.760]   Makes me feel guilty. I break down apple boxes all the time and I feel so
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.240]   Like I'm not gonna keep them. It's a box
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:59.360]   Ebay. Oh my bit. You can say I bet you can eat it apparently people do ebay them and I just I have a collection if you need
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.600]   You know, I hate throwing them out. I feel guilty because they are beautiful
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.960]   But I but at their end of the day. They're just the box
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.200]   I just know that if I ever throw one away the device is gonna have a problem. I'm gonna be asking the back
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.600]   I'm gonna scramble for a box. No, but that's the problem is apple has never asked me for the box ever
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.040]   You bring it to the store. They don't say where's the box. No
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.600]   Um
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.480]   By the way, there's a great passage in Walter isakson's
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:30.000]   Biography of steve jobs where they talk about this and uh johnny. I was talking about and steve saying
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.280]   You know, we want to make the first experience of the device
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.080]   Uh, uh, uh, moment and the way to do that is present it
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.040]   In the packaging and so that's all designed around this
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.920]   Theatrix of the prison the first time you see your new loved one
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.560]   in the box
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:56.000]   That's that that is an important thing. I wonder if they would consider extending that to even like the in-store purchase bit the only
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.440]   I
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.120]   I have now bought
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.280]   two maybe three mac books
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.720]   Uh in apple stores and they've always been
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.400]   Actually, let's let's call it. Let's call it one more because the the my ipad pro cost a thousand bucks
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.800]   I've always I've always felt a little bit let down that I didn't even
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.200]   They didn't even have me walk more than eight feet into the store
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.400]   I was met at the door because that's time for me to either buy or pick up my the thing that I ordered and
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.120]   It was oh, oh, that's right. The oh, that's right. It's a 13 inch macbook pro
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.640]   Yeah, so 22 $20 $100 and yes, it's all right
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.440]   Just wait right here and then they've gone to the radio and make small talk with me for a minute and a half
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.120]   And then I'm handed a plastic bag a nice plastic bag with the 20
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:46.000]   $200 computer and I'm on my way and it's nice and efficient
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.840]   But I don't want I don't want to be sat down and being given cocoa and pet and finger sandwiches
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.440]   But I just bought some other 200 bucks man. Do I do I get to sit down?
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.000]   When I bought when I got my google glass and we have a cup of tea, please
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.240]   It was a
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.440]   For my google glass
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:09.040]   It was less much less expensive than that and it was a concierge experience where someone was assigned to me
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.280]   for 45 minutes to walk me through it and demonstrate it and fit it and
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.160]   Coke in real glass bottles that was served. I buy table bottle service
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.240]   And it's like I feel like okay
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.520]   I feel not
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.880]   Not quite so bad about spending $1,500 on a beta product now
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.480]   Because it's I feel as though they're making me feel okay
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.200]   Well, that's at least worth a bottle of Coke that cost us 89 cents a Costco
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:39.360]   Yeah, I would I would like them to at least here is here is the pickup experience is if you'd like to sit and wait
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.960]   We also have again here's moist tubble it. I'm always tubble it something
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.560]   I do admit and I do admit that I have yelled at producers who have opened
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   The packages for me for products to review saying no, no, that's not that's not your job
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.600]   Let me open my own gosh darn packages
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.680]   At the other on the other hand, I kind of wish apple would at least give you uh, it feels very
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   I don't know it feels a little
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:14.000]   High-end and um kind of rude. I wish they give you a choice of as as amazon for instance does of can I just have it in like
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.520]   recyclable
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.320]   Night, you know inexpensive old that newspaper people bought here you go a newspaper. I'll take it because I feel
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:30.080]   It's a little ostentatious almost and it's very much, you know a consumption thing, you know, I don't it's not it's it's
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.520]   It's not like you buy a laptop every it's meant to be a man of a sin
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:40.240]   The theme of a lot of the shows that we do is that we aren't we happy that there's so many different approaches from company to company true
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.680]   I like the fact that there are other companies that are
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.840]   Amazon packages and stuff generally and corrugated boxes
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.160]   Even the the the fire
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.720]   tablets and it seems to say
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.320]   We know that you will enjoy if we spent an extra
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:01.600]   $10 on this box you would have enjoyed it and would it made you feel good for about 12 seconds?
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.120]   Right and then you throw it away
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.640]   We'd think we you'd much rather have the extra $12 to spend on books and music or maybe a burrito
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.520]   So i'm glad that there are these other it's a choice
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.880]   When you look at an x is 5x compared to an iphone 6
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.640]   It's hard to say that the iphone 6 is objectively a better phone
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.920]   Even though it costs two or three hundred dollars more than the five x
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.720]   They did things like instead of a really beautiful aluminum body. It's a plastic body
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.320]   But it really really well done plastic body instead of things being done
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.480]   We can't see a single seam anywhere. Okay, if you want to look okay. Yes, there's a seam here and there
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.800]   But you're probably we know that you're probably going to be putting it in a protective rubber case anyway
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.480]   So there goes the advantage of the seam. So I like the fact that there are different approaches to uh with the different models
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.960]   Likewise so just to prove that apple isn't perfect
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.600]   I'm using
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:53:01.040]   No, actually we're going to talk about apple. Hey, uh, bintomsen made an interesting point on the talk show on groupers talk show last week
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.800]   He's saying apple blew a huge a massive opportunity
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.720]   To promote apple pay better last fall merchants across the us of course, uh had to upgrade their
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.440]   their point of sale
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.600]   Hardware to support pin and uh this new system
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.080]   Gene monster and by the way this philip elmer to what is combined these two facts
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.320]   It did some calculations. He thinks now we know gene sometimes gets things wrong
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.960]   But he thinks that it only about
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.360]   20 of new iPhones have activated apple pay
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:40.960]   Uh, there's also of course, um, you know the anecdotal evidence that you just don't see people
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.160]   Not just and apple pay but any touch to pay you just don't see people using those systems very often
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:52.720]   Um, and and so the question is is it is was it a missed opportunity for apple? Should they have
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:59.440]   You know taking advantage of this great liability shift and uh and and got more apple because I
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:06.240]   And you i'm sure it would agree with this if you're using the card with the new chip and pin system or the chip and sign system
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.320]   It's not convenient. You have to put the card in and leave it in
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.280]   And it takes a while slow and apple pay is much faster
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:20.800]   You've been doing a long time, but so you know, I I now understand maybe your enthusiasm for apple pay because for us
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.280]   A swipe of a card isn't the hardest thing in the world
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.640]   We still have to use chip and pin for tips because tat-the-pay doesn't have a tipping system yet
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.120]   So if you had a restaurant or any other place that expects gratuities
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:34.560]   There's just no tap and pay system for that so you're still doing pin and chip and we've just gotten so used to it because it's been five
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.640]   10 years. It's just like i've never signed anything so I don't I barely remember it
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.560]   But you know, Ben has a really good point, but it goes back to that culture thing apple
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.960]   Did miss an opportunity, but apple was not culturally positioned to take advantage of that apple has always been a will take care of the top line
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.040]   And the bottom line will sort of take care of itself
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:56.640]   And you've seen that like apple has a handful of evangelists when blackberry 10 wash, I think they had 300 microsoft has had
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:02.320]   You know dozens and hundreds of evangelists. They just put a lot of boots on the ground and apple historically has not done that
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.680]   So uh a non apple company might have had you might have hired
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:13.680]   uh just dozens and dozens hundreds maybe thousands of people to go literally store to store and to have signs ready for them and branding and training
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.720]   And all of these things and it's the same thing we've heard
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:22.800]   Like apple music they might have hired uh marketing assistants to actually sit with every star and help them, you know
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.080]   Do connect for at least six months on a day-to-day basis to launch it
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.440]   But it's just not something I don't even think apple thinks about that stuff or if they do it's not at a level
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.960]   Where they believe they can implement it because that that would require a very different sort of mindset
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.000]   So absolutely a blown opportunity, but it's it's just that's technically the way apple does at home kit too
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.760]   Uh, they have a really good program, but there's nobody out there with manufacturers really giving them the marketing doing this
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.960]   They're doing the awareness going around showing people whatever health
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.040]   Home kit can do
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.320]   Alternatively, I go to the mall and there's a samson kiosk up there with people just walking by trying to show you their latest product
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:06.000]   It's kind of ironic apple invented product evangelism with guy kawasaki many moons ago one one guy well one guy, right
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.440]   It's easier than it was a smaller different smaller
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.720]   Market you agree and he did apple miss a missing opportunity
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:21.280]   I don't know. I think that they did a much better job that then google and other manufacturers did because yeah
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.000]   Because android pay was out long time before apple pay right exactly. I I would even do it existed
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.600]   I'm always amused and debased to admit that
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.240]   Uh, I used google wallet on my nexus five phone that had nfc and worked with tap to pay
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.480]   And would have worked on every single one of these stores that I was testing out apple pay on and it wasn't until apple pay came out
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.520]   That it that reminded me that oh this thing exists and I can actually use it on my day-to-day android phone
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:55.040]   So I don't uh and the other problem I have the other thing is that i'm wondering how much more they could have done
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   To get the word out about it
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:03.600]   It's it'd be nice if every single person who owns an iphone was using tap to pay or we're using
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:10.720]   All the capabilities of their device would be wonderful if people were to switch phones because they they love this
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:18.160]   Feature that is they think is only available on this one device, but um, it's it's difficult when you
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.800]   Uh have to face the fact that
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:28.400]   People who own iphones are just one section of the entire community of people who spend who spend money on things
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.160]   I
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.480]   If you spend more time on noticing the devices that are people are using on subways
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.880]   On commuter rail on buses
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:43.120]   In the universities and everywhere the people hang out you will see that the iphone is a probably the most noticeable phone up there
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.480]   But it's only part of that ecosystem up there. So
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.160]   There's a limit to how much of the people spending money market that they can actually actually capture
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:56.160]   I think they did a great job. I think that people are as more people start to
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:00.560]   Age out and into the system where people can be using tap to pay
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:06.160]   I think just the simple thing of being behind somebody who drops their uh, I always throw
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.720]   I went out of every five times that I use tap to pay on my android phone. I wind up
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:17.360]   Evangelizing the concept to the people behind me because they see me just drop the phone like on top of
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.480]   the pad
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.800]   At the drugstore at the pharmacy and just do nothing and then my hero be I just
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   I just pluck it off of there and so what do you just do? I just pay for okay?
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:31.600]   Okay, my phone with what kind of phone do you have? I have oh, yeah, that's right. That's a built-in feature. You just uh, kimp
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:37.920]   I think you'd much rather pay for that yogurt that's about to go bad if I'm gonna tell you the entire history of contactless payments
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:44.080]   But believe me if you were to do a google search for the name of your phone and contactless payments you will learn this instance
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.680]   It's it's a scene man. You should maybe we're just old habits. Stay hard. We're just not that interested
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.600]   I don't know if that's fully apples fall. That's it. That's it too people credit cards that work fine cash works fine
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.800]   You have to identify a pain point for people where they feel as though it my god. It's such a horrible
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:08.480]   A breach of my time and my patience to have to actually hold out a $20 bill and get change back
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.800]   It's I I use it all the time because I just like it. I just it's less fuss. It's more secure
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:20.880]   I like the fact that I get digital receipts that are a lot easier to track for me than uh, then of course using cash
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:27.600]   But if it's working for other people you're telling please abandon please abandon this thing that you're using that you trust that you know
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:33.760]   To something that you don't necessarily trust yet and you have to real there's always that remember that there's always that
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:40.720]   Uh 0.75 to 1.3 seconds where you're not 100 sure that the
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.320]   That the end of that the payment system is going to go through
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:47.840]   Because it's it's just just that pause where oh my god
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.960]   Is this is this like a kiosk where it has the logo on the reader?
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:57.040]   But they don't have the software turned on and am I gonna look like an idiot because I just put my phone to this thing expecting magic to happen
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.920]   So yeah, I mean I have I have some touch to pay system on me at all times
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.360]   I rarely use it. I mean this Samsung pay even works with swipe
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.640]   Machines and I still rarely use it. It's just like
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:14.320]   I just swipe I use it all the time now because I'm so paranoid that all my all my credit cards and debit cards have had
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.200]   Tap to pay for five years and my greatest fear is I will drop it at a gas station and pay for gas for the next
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   Seven or ten people in line. So this to me is so much better because it's either my thumbprint or my pulse and if it loses
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.960]   Either those things it no longer works. Uh and that to me is just much more secure
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.000]   Oh, I mean, there's no question is better and sick more secure
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.720]   It's just not a better enough and that's why I thought maybe Canadians and others who have to do that
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:46.960]   Have had to do the dip and chip thing. Hey, baby. I did chips. Maybe for them. Maybe for you. It's a it's a it's just a little bit more of a
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:52.960]   hurdle to not use apple pay. Maybe that's enough to push you into it, but but our problem was the banks the banks took
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.040]   Like the banks were just now three banks have started adopting it my bank hasn't so I have my
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.600]   I can't I have with the american express but most places here don't take american express tap
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.040]   So three banks have started another three banks are going to start mid-june
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.160]   And then we'll see but it's still at the point where I mean mcdonald's takes it a bunch of other places takes it
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.920]   And when I use it, they're still oh my god. I've never seen that before that's the coolest thing in the world
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.240]   But until it becomes routine then it's not really part of mainstream culture who wants to have that conversation
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.720]   Do you think in ten years?
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.400]   It'll just be it will all just use tap to pay and that'll be that and it was just you know, it just took a while
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.120]   Yeah, yeah, I think so. Okay
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.320]   Remember that we're so beholden to that first generation that grew up with a technology
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.400]   That once we have the first generation that when they have their first bank account that they're used to simply pay
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.080]   That's that's how you buy that's how you buy things that cost less than 40 dollars
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.400]   You always just take out your phone to pay for it
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.560]   This is why this is the first generation that really understood
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.760]   The capabilities of messaging on a smartphone and why you weren't limited to voice and text
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.160]   It became part of their lifestyle because that's how they learned how to talk to each other. So no, it's true
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.000]   When we when credit cards first came out, nobody used them when ATMs first emerged. Nobody used them. I remember I was kind of
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.400]   I would I used home banking on Bank of America when it was a
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.720]   20 by 40 display but black white text on a black screen even though I was using a graphical, you know, I was using a Mac
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.320]   And I used it and it just takes a while. That's all now. Everybody does you know ATMs and
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.880]   I had relatives who would not use online banking and then very slowly they got an online bank
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.240]   But then they would print everything out because they were just used to having a paper copy
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.240]   And they didn't want to not get the paper bills in the mail because they thought that they would miss them
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.840]   But then they heard this report about identity theft people stealing the paper bills
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.440]   And then that scared them into going fully online. It took something that really made them afraid to get that point of transition going
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.960]   And we're all like that there there was for years. I wouldn't deposit
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.880]   I wanted every time I wanted to deposit a check
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.240]   I had to go to a teller to do it because I didn't there's something about feeding it into the ATM
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.480]   And simply here is a number on the screen that says that we have recognized this as a check
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.920]   That I didn't like and now I'm sort of trying to get my head around the idea
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.480]   Should I use the phone feature to that all it's how it's how it's how it's how it checks
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.000]   I'm not I'm not quite there yet. You know what happened my bank
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.480]   I work I banked with usa a and they used to if it was more than what was it 5,000
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.800]   I can't remember what it was there was a limit if it was a large check
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.120]   You had to you had to bring it somewhere in my case the ups store
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.120]   To deposit it so I would make a monthly trip to the ups store to deposit my paycheck
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.040]   and
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.160]   Just like a month ago. I went to the ups store. They said
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.120]   No, wait, they turned it off. Yeah, I said what oh, that's a pain
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.960]   Now what do I have to do mail it to texas?
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.040]   And they said no no they raised the a anti now you can now I can deposit up to a hundred thousand dollars via
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.400]   A picture around my phone. I don't know what the hold up was
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.480]   A picture is a picture right? I mean when you catch a check
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.280]   I don't think I just have such sympathy for those people who didn't understand
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.640]   Atms and and credit cards because it's like wait a minute
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:01.680]   So I the same mechanism I use to take a picture of my hoegy and put it on instagram
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.960]   Will take this thousands of dollars that I have and actually turn it into I
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.680]   It's just whether they take a picture at the bank or you take the picture. It's the same either way
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.480]   It's still a picture of a check that's going out to the
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.280]   Whoever it is the clear the clearance house
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.760]   All right. Anyway, uh, let's uh take a break more to talk about rene richy from i'more.com
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.440]   How's that apple talk podcast going these days going well?
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.920]   Oh, yeah, really great. Uh, we just had carolina carolina millinese who was at google
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:37.280]   I owe to talk about digital assistance and the difference between those with personality and without with apis and without with inner
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.680]   International thousand and we should be doing vr this week very interesting
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.920]   Yeah, it strikes me with the progress that we're making google's trying this out in the south bay
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.600]   We won't need that
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.240]   Watch or a phone or a credit card. I'll just see you
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.840]   And it'll use whatever cues it uses to because it's all about i-thadication and say oh hi leo
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.520]   I'm wearing my nixon mask right now. Right google has a thing where um, you just say your initials
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:07.680]   This is only in it like at mcdonald's and i-hop or something in the south bay in silicon valley next in mountain view
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.240]   But you just say they say okay, we're your initials lg. Oh, okay. Fine. You're done
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.040]   Yeah, my voice is my passport right
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.080]   It sees your phone in your pocket and it's exactly that's it they can authenticate the actual device itself isn't amazing
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.520]   I mean, but that's really the end game all of this is intermediate technology
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:32.400]   Yeah, the the perfect google product is at the precise intersection point between amazing
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.960]   miraculous
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.960]   Exactly
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:42.560]   Really want that you'll go right up to the creepy line, but stop
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.480]   R. R. Ray. Do you really want another hamburger? I'm sorry google. I'll leave now
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:53.120]   And I do use you know somebody's pointing out you can now use voice or facial recognition to log into your banking app on your phone
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.880]   I you and uh, so there we're getting there. We're getting there
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   Annie and nakko's also here. He does a podcast called material where he does talk about google on replay
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.080]   Uh, the replay dot is it replay dot FM replay don't FM. Yeah, no static at all
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.760]   Relay
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.720]   Oh, sorry relay. Sorry relay. Oh crap. I you know, okay now I got the FM right, but I got the relay part
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   I didn't want my curly coming after us. I know
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.760]   No relay dot FM and material podcast all about google
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.200]   That must be disorienting for people who are used to you on mac break weekly all of a sudden
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.240]   Well, it's it's kind of fun because
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.560]   We record both shows in the same day. So it's nice that like while we're recording mac break
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.000]   We'll be tweets like oh my god. What apple and he is such an apple hater. Why is he on the mac show?
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.560]   My god apple such a google. He's already told always talking about apple. Why is he on why is he on a google show?
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.360]   Which means that I I'm doing fine. No, I'm saying
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:56.480]   I was laughing welcome to it. You're walking the fine line between creepy and cool. That's all you got to do in life
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.760]   Yeah
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.440]   We'll have more in just a bit if you're a magazine fan you know magazines
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.960]   I think are still the last bastion of
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:11.280]   Really great print journalism. I with all due respect to the chicago sun times the fine newspaper you you work for
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.160]   I I don't know how I guess I guess the big newspapers will survive but
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.960]   the I gosh, I hope there's always a vanity fair and a rolling stone and a
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.000]   Wired and these magazines are so great. There's almost every month. There's an article
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.800]   I want to read in the new yorker every week in the new yorker
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.040]   I the picture photo essay I want to see in national geographic
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.680]   The problem is if you were to subscribe to all of these not only with the cost be out of control
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.480]   But you'd have paper everywhere your coffee table would break with the burden
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.080]   And if I feel guilty recycling boxes imagine how I feel throwing out a hundred magazines every month
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.040]   You could buy it on the newsstand that had to talk about cost going through the roof. That'd be crazy
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.880]   So here's what I recommend and what I use now and I love it. It's called texture
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.400]   And it's like netflix for magazines you can binge
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.480]   read
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.320]   Really great if you travel
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.960]   Because instead of bringing a you know a half dozen magazines with you you bring your ipad or your iphone or your tablet and you've got it
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.320]   And by the way all the magazines, I mean everything it's fantastic
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.760]   Men's health and wired and interviewed in the new yorker and vogue
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.960]   Esquire and what's nice is I probably would
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   never get vogue
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.080]   ever
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.760]   But there's something in there that I would enjoy you know
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.000]   Rolling stone. I know there's always one article. I read I want to read every month
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.720]   uh people magazine. I know I I feel guilty buying it, but don't you want to know Steve harvey's
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.600]   story from homeless to 100 million dollars
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.800]   You do want to know that I know you do and see these way you can read it kind of surreptitiously
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.640]   And if the your spouse comes in the room you just jump back to wired magazine sports illustrated
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.280]   everything and then this is every page
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.000]   in the current issue every page
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.720]   and back issues and
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.120]   Stuff that you don't get in the magazine like bone is content like video
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.680]   So this is such a good deal one flat rate all the magazines

[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.200]   Oh, yeah all the time. Yeah, uh, as a fact
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.640]   My most most fun interactions I ever had was uh, uh, I was uh selling
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:06.160]   I was selling a lot of features to playboy and my uh, my mom didn't know how to express her pride in that
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.120]   That's pretty good actually
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.960]   Yeah, that was it but there were absolutely hands down one of the best magazines I ever wrote for you
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:22.160]   You've written article from playboy. Wow. I've I've had I've had artwork published in playboy. That's on my what that's on my
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.200]   Yeah, there was a uh, article where I needed to explain something very very technical
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.280]   And I decided I still have the artwork upstairs somewhere where I just basically decided to
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.600]   Write do a cartoon explaining how it worked or and we I talked with my editors
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.080]   Oh, well, could you just like do it like in stick figures or something?
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.800]   Our market is illustrated to do it. Yeah, we'll do it
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.960]   So I basically cartooned the whole thing and they said
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:50.960]   Actually our illustrator will just trace over this and illustrate. Oh, don't know. I can say I've got I've had my artwork publishing playboy
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.080]   No, there's certain things if you're a writer, you know getting published in
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.800]   There's certain like New Yorker
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.240]   Playboys absolutely on that list of like super prestigious you're up there with norm and mailer kind of
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.920]   Life also goals. I think that's fantastic. I had no idea
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:13.200]   Also also the editing process there is it feels it really does feel like this is what it must have been like in the 60s to
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   to
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.240]   Because
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.800]   the back and forth between the editor and the real sacredness of every sentence and then
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:28.880]   There's the first only time that I had I was writing for a magazine that had like a hundred like
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.320]   International editions because number one they would pay me a great amount of money for this feature article
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.280]   And then for the next four months there'd be other huge checks
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.840]   Oh, we we sold it to a lot we sold it to the english edition that we sold to the the french edition
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.960]   We sold to the do buy edition. We sold it to the the brazilian edition decided to take your your article too
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:53.680]   As like my god, it's like it's every writer's dream to get paid for stuff that you didn't technically have to write or translate yourself
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.240]   It's nice. It was those those were the days
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.400]   Um
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.760]   And of course, Andy many people don't know was the 1974 gatefold. Uh, I think mr. May
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:11.840]   In playboy magazine. That was a lot of waxing but you know what they made they made me feel like I could really express
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.200]   That side of myself. It was it was a place of peace and safety. Yeah
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.560]   I'm just glad that they got me when my figure when I was 23. That's how I got started in this business was writing
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.120]   Uh, I think my first piece was in either info world or bite
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.440]   And it was uh, and there were some Atari magazine pieces too
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.040]   But I felt pretty good when I got a piece in bite magazine. I felt like
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.760]   I'm done. Oh, yeah, no that no that's this
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.280]   My first my first published anything was in soft talk magazine the soft talk magazine. Yeah
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:49.200]   That was that was just like a contest entry that they summarize and was so imagine like being like in junior high and seeing your name in this magazine that you
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.000]   Run to the mailbox to get every single month and then I actually I shouldn't give short drift
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.240]   I my first real work was at mac user
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:04.560]   Uh started my first stuff in 1989. I remember it was 1989 because I got they gave me a column and I remember it was 1989 because
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.240]   real
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.080]   Real optimistic guy thinking okay. Well if it takes them five
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:17.600]   Columns for the editors to find out. I'm a total fraud. I can at least put mac user magazine columnist 1989 through
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.400]   1990 on the resume and they don't know it was just october november december january
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.200]   By the way, yes magazines yay magazines. Yeah magazines
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.240]   Uh moving on
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.280]   iPhone error 53 plaintiffs
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:39.680]   No, no, no, no, no, I can talk about it. I gotta talk about it
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:47.920]   What's the upshot on the bricking speaking of errors er if was there 56? Yeah special order 56 kill all the stormtroopers
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.520]   Did the apple update the uh
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.560]   Yeah, they pulled it and then they released a new version. Okay, and nobody's getting bricked
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.720]   What do we know what britt? I mean was I I put it on my ipad pro. No problem
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.280]   What do we know it was the 9.7 inch specifically and it's it generated a hardware error
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.680]   So I'm not quite sure what that was my 9/7 before I read that and I didn't have a problem me too
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   Yeah, okay
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.760]   So whatever it's a small person. It's always a small percentage of users, but at apple scale that is millions of you
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   Yeah, right exactly
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.320]   Fox go ahead. I would say so who cares if it's millions of people if it's you that's all it takes
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.880]   Yes, just one
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.840]   Fox con is replacing 60,000 workers with robots
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.640]   Uh, I don't know if they'll be making iPhones fox con of course is the
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.360]   Does fox con make all the iPhones
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.040]   Uh, there's an yeah, I mean there's another supplier that occasionally does apple orders
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.920]   But I think fox con gets this line share of them most of the time. Yeah
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.480]   So how do you feel about that on the one hand, you know, we've been complaining about
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.840]   difficult working conditions child labor whatever
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.800]   suicides at fox con
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.440]   Uh, now they're gonna use robots
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.840]   Was it was it worse having a low paying horrible job, but at least you had a job?
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:14.160]   Well, now you're talking about this to run the robots. Oh, yeah, there's four people to run the robots
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:21.920]   But also to be fair a lot of this work can't be done by humans anymore. It can only be done by humans supervising robots now
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.720]   Right, so and particularly when we're talking about the
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.160]   Imagine apple is apple is just one company
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.760]   We're not just talking about fox cons just making making apple products
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.440]   But if you imagine the tens of millions of iPhones that that apple makes that each have to be made
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.280]   And assembled how many people can you possibly hire to keep up with that kind of demand without automating the crap out of it?
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.840]   Right, so in principle, I don't think that
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.280]   I don't like automation as a cost cutting measure
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.440]   But there I do recognize there times where you can't just simply be on the you know
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.200]   Being on a campaign campaign speech. I will talk to these people and make them not hire robots
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.320]   Or at least make them use american robots to assemble things. Sometimes you have to say well, we're
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.400]   We can't you cannot look at look at the look at the trans the components that are on a phone
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.280]   And say imagine somebody
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:19.360]   Having to take this one take of one fourth of a grain of rice and glue it with conductive adhesives
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.600]   In exactly the right place at the right time 10 000 times a day. No, no
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.280]   Any any iPhone seven rumors we want to disseminate that are worthy of
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.600]   Always
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.440]   A four speakers different. Yeah, we talked about that last week. Yeah, love it
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.600]   There is a Chinese accessory maker showing a prototype for lightning to
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.560]   phono jack mini jack
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.040]   That's never if any is whatsoever
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:51.280]   Every time every time you see a rumor of this kind remember that it's the company announcing to other to other
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.400]   Distributors we will have the ability to build this when this thing is needs to be built
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.720]   It's not we are we have seen a design and now we're playing making plans based on the design is saying
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:06.640]   We whatever we will be able to in in two weeks time have working product in a in
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.160]   Storage shelves so by all means if you're planning on stocking such an item or carrying such an item in catalog
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.680]   Keep us in mind because this is the sort of stuff we make the sense that the
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.840]   Phone cases are probably the absolute worst source of apple rumors
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:27.360]   The next the next bad source is usually a annal and analyst without a really proven track record
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.880]   But then the next one above that is uh iphone case manufacturers
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.360]   It's more like I tuned I tuned a radio to a
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.480]   Place on the dial that was kind of close to the station
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.880]   But not really and listen to it for 10 minutes and that's the that's the quality of the information you're getting
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.200]   There was a one though not a business when they went all in on those teardop sh does teardrop shaped cases
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.920]   Five or five s yeah, I think though
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.680]   I'm gonna credit the rumor that they are dropping the
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.400]   Headphone port right or is that still very speculative?
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.000]   It feels like that might really until they hold it up on stage Leo everything is
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.360]   Everything's speculative but uh I could see I could see that happening
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.680]   I I can say that I I believe there to be very serious discussions about that
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.160]   Far beyond the hey, of course apple takes apple checks out every single possible idea
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.760]   That said though. I like like when I say you believe it when you actually see timco holding it up
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.280]   Uh and not making sure it's not a joke item that's supposed to
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.920]   Spout confetti from it saying of course we would ever build something like this. No at faucek
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   No, come on. Let's let's bring out the real ones bring up the real one. We do know that uh
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.200]   um
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.360]   apple wants to put syri in the next version of os 10 so that you can talk to
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.360]   Your computer, you know, I already have that in windows and I find uh, I don't use it all that often
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.560]   Uh, because you know when you're using a computer in an office or whatever
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.000]   You're not likely to talk out loud to it. You're more likely to use a keyboard and mouse
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.720]   However, uh, we also know that google has announced an amazon echo like product google home
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.360]   It's some rumors that apple might be looking at something like that
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:06.400]   Uh nine to five max says that the it could be in related to the
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.120]   uh apple tv apple tv could be home for rumored amazon echo like
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.840]   syri speaker
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.200]   Uh venture beat says a source has indicated a new version of apple tv might be a competitor
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.400]   For maybe a mac the syri could be a competitor too if you just happen to have one in your living room
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.920]   I mean apple has a multi device strategy that I really like because that way echo is your assistant home and the echo though
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.720]   I mean part of the secret sauce of the echo is some specialized microphones that are that being format
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.160]   Yeah, it's seven microphones arranged all the way around the thing and also really a lot of it is
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:47.840]   concept where here is a discrete device that is powered on all the time and is
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.280]   For a place someplace prominently. It's not something where you have to hold down a button to make it work
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.040]   It's not something where you have to be near where this computer is to make it work
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:03.040]   Uh, it's and it's not mixed in with a device that does 18 different things including being an apple tv
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.480]   Uh, it is like here is a dedicated appliance that here is somebody who here is an entity that will then listen to what I
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:15.040]   Listen to my instructions and act on those instructions. Uh, so i'm uh, i've uh even cortana on windows
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.520]   They've it's i think it's successful because they really have promoted it not as hey
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:24.960]   We've added something to this or we've taken something that's available on one of our other products and we've put it into the desktop
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.520]   It's no we this this is really a core feature of this thing. We are designed
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.480]   This is a core part of our interface to windows 10
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:38.000]   Um, i'm not sure how well syria work conceptually if if I know that if I hold down the function key
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.920]   I can speak something
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.920]   Uh, really I have a I have a
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.400]   Alexa the next room and the number of times where I
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:51.440]   Actually, I have the I have an actual keyboard underneath my fingers or i've got an actual iPad like underneath my underneath my hands
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.160]   and I have to do nothing but simply say
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.080]   trigger word
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:02.240]   What type what time is it right now in in chicago or what's the weather right now or add this to my calendar or actually i was watching
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.680]   Colombo
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.960]   this morning and uh and I say how when was uh, the
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.800]   Well, a certain actress what when when did she when was she born?
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:16.320]   And again, I have an iPad in my lab. I can actually just hold down the home button and ask syria this question
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.120]   But
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:23.600]   I'm just used to simply doing nothing but saying asking a question as though my spouse is in the next room and she knows everything
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.440]   And she's tolerant of my just simply barking out questions and giving me answers
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.720]   So it's it's not just the technology of parsing speech
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:37.440]   It's also understanding the way that people want to interact with such a thing and the right answer might be a dedicated device that you just
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   Simply always exists
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.400]   And kind of tie that stuff together. We had
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.040]   We had a really good conversation. It's not out yet on a podcast with nittin ganatra and don melton again
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.080]   And they were talking about apple and nfc chips and how for years apple was experimenting with nfc
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.560]   And scott forest all said, you know, this is a chip not a feature and even like uh opin hymer
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.760]   Who was the cfo at the time said, you know, just the stuff isn't there for it yet
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.440]   And they took a couple of years and eventually they didn't really ship nfc
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:07.680]   They shipped apple pay and so you know you look at apple working on a hub one of the apple tv
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.640]   Apple tv took years to get out and they were like pbr versions and there were hub versions
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:18.960]   And there were rumors for years about apple building a device that would just sit there and you know stage downloads for you and do all sorts of convenience stuff for you
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.800]   And be the real home kit hub
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.720]   And instead we got the apple tv we got now
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.480]   So this stuff is sort of when you see these rumors apple's always working on these things
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.880]   If we can talk about it on a show or something and blog it on the internet a company with billions and billions of dollars
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.720]   Can absolutely afford to prototype it
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.560]   It's always just a question of when they they go to market with it and how and what form it takes
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:43.200]   There is a rumor cnet is promulgating that there might even be a camera in a echo competitor from apple
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.840]   This is all prime sense
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.200]   You know who knows although I have ordered and I hope to get it sometime
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.560]   I don't know I gave them 800 bucks a couple of years ago
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:56.240]   So I hope to get it sometimes in this gibo thing which has a camera
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.960]   Uh and a screen in it and uh it's very much like an echo in the sense that you talk to it
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.240]   It talks to you, but it also will take pictures of you and has some
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.160]   Personality and so forth. I this is this could I could see this as a breakthrough product for apple
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.800]   Couldn't you I mean if you're exploring breakthrough areas
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:17.680]   I don't see the nuance version had cameras and beamforming mics and you would snap twice and it would lock on you
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.840]   And then you could talk while going through a crowded room full of noisy people and it would only identify your voice
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.120]   But that's a lot of technological overhead for a home. Yeah
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.720]   Yeah, I guess
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:32.800]   I don't see that kind of device until they until they've got some sort of of side real eye on
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:38.480]   And uh propulsion engines so that could actually hover and follow you around silently
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.480]   Uh, I don't I don't see the idea of so long as you're within line of sight of this device it can turn its head and aim its camera
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.800]   You I don't I don't I really don't see the idea
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.600]   I don't see the the the the plus of having a camera
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.920]   Equipped on one of these devices unless you're building it as a chat thing and else
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.600]   Let's have the ability to really steer you steer itself around and and uh and follow you for confidence and thing
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.440]   Even so I just don't see it as a useful feature right now
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.320]   Even if you were a very lonely uh eight-year-old girl
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:12.880]   Who didn't have any friends but had a sleepover with your little like scarlet your hands friendly robot
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.200]   It's yeah, see this is see I that's a great demo video
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.680]   But this is this is the sort this is the sort of thing you design when you're creating a movie
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.800]   And you can create any sort of technology that has to look exact people have to be able to figure out what this thing is for immediately
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.800]   They don't figure out that the if your your prototypical your hypothetical eight-year-old lonely girl
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.880]   Will find a community a community of other eight to ten-year-old girls online
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.480]   And they don't need a little robot that swivels its head that it can pretend that this little robot pal is her friend
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.360]   She can find actual friends anywhere in the world
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.000]   Talk about things that are
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.280]   This internet is there anything it can't do
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:58.880]   Anyway, I hope I hope you're all wrong and when I get my gbo you're gonna be so jealous
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.120]   Cabbage patch kid but with interactive AI
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.920]   Apple considered according to nine to five Mac buying time Warner last year
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.320]   Not true
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.800]   Not true. There you go the end of that one
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.360]   This is not true. It's wrong. Not true. This is from actually from the financial times
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:23.040]   Eddy q raised the idea to meeting with time Warner's head of corporate strategy Olaf Olafson
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:31.360]   That you could easily see eddy q going well. What if we watch around? We'll just buy you but I mean that is that is a negotiation tactic not an offer
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.920]   Yeah, we could just buy you
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.400]   Uh, all right
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.160]   By the way worth about because it's not just time Warner, but it's hbo and cnn
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.480]   I think it's a one-look at the DC comics movies and just said pass hard pass
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.960]   Uh
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.960]   Okay
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:26:00.240]   My understanding is it's not true. I mean I could always be I'm running I'm biting my tongue here because we can have a long we can have a long discussion about
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:09.600]   About like I think that the Marvel movies are like the android. Oh, I thought I was about the term Warner's thing you guys are fighting over comic books
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:16.160]   I just have a little sympathy and let me complete my thought because I want Renee to be properly insulted
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.760]   That is that the Marvel movies are the ones that make
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.200]   Millions of dollars and own the mark have has the greatest market share
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:29.360]   But they're they're not really all that good. They're not well made. There's not that craftsmanship
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.560]   You'll see that there's the case just the the the flood the dead pool was very good
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.400]   That pool was the best maybe the best marvel movie ever. Yeah, okay, but really spider-man early x-men
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:46.640]   But yeah, but you're right most of them right now. I feel like cynical attempts to cash in on the market
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   I just want a fun movie. I don't they don't have to be works of art, but a glowery Superman is lost on me
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.560]   So glower. Oh, yeah, I just want I just want to reason why iron man has a hulkbuster armor
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.240]   And why he's suddenly fighting the hulk after they were just working together
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:06.800]   And just at least put something in there that says here's what we it's not just because we knew this would look good in the trailer
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.360]   And also we need another smashy bashy. We had so we had actually eight lines of dialogue
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.000]   So we need to make up for it. It's the toys and not codes all about the toys all about the action figures
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.280]   Yeah, we just get along. Let's just all get along you super here
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:24.400]   Does an uncontrollable ramp page and engine of destruction that the adventures have to protect themselves against but then
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.320]   That the end because now he needs to be someone that could actually fight the alien
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.800]   So hey hulk fight the aliens and don't beat us up either you can do i've always had that control
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.640]   Okay, i'm sorry. I smash smash smash
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.240]   This isn't marvel movie break weekly
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.160]   Apple thinking about making electric car charging stations now if you're going to make electric cars
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.960]   You got to solve this fueling problem. Of course, uh tesla famously
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:56.800]   Thic considered both important products as supercharger and the automobile
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:02.400]   Uh, there are this is all leaks. I hate leaks, but this comes from roiters and their sources
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:11.120]   roiters sources understand that apple is asking charging station manufacturers about the technology for its off to rumored electric car
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   Project nrg energy
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.400]   Said well, we're talking to every potential manufacturer of tomorrow
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:26.960]   Yeah, wait until you do facebook car leo and the amazon car is free if you do deliveries for them. It's amazing. I'm one of the a manufacturer of tomorrow
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.840]   Are they actually making tomorrow?
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:33.040]   Yes in their little elf factories
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.880]   It is interesting though because a car involves so many things that like for the phone
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.120]   You do have to go through the fcc and you do have to go through the carriers, but it's still a pretty contained project
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:47.840]   But when it gets to getting legal authorization to put your thing on the road in many countries and everything infrastructure in place to support all of that
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:55.200]   Everywhere from retail to you know refueling if it needs special kinds of refueling that that is a much larger and much more leaky endeavor
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:01.200]   Yeah, and there actually there's there are some cities that are actually trying to give breaks to companies saying please
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.560]   We will we will work with you to give you a legislation that will allow you to operate driverless vehicles and
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.040]   In our cities because we really want we really want you to build a transportation
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:17.520]   Infrastructure that we ourselves don't necessarily have to pay for so there's a lot of interesting movement here. Although of course, this is a
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.320]   Here we are talking about a rumor
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.920]   Not just a rumor of an unannounced and unofficial product or project that a rumor about
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.840]   Accessory for a rumored accessory about an unannounced product or accessory
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.200]   Now in apple hiring news. This is very good news
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:42.320]   John callus who founded pgp corpse silent circle and black phone a really prestigious security guy who by the way
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:51.840]   Was at apple in the 90s during security and again between 2009 and 2011 we designed an encryption system protecting data stored in the mac
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.520]   Uh, I guess I don't know if that's file vault, but I would guess that is file vault
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.680]   He has now been hired which joined rejoined apple in this month
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:06.720]   And uh, while apple doesn't say what he'll be doing. I have to think it has something to do with hardening its encryption against
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.640]   Yeah, senate is not the new chef cafe max. Yes. Let's
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.800]   Well, I'm sure he's a wonderful car immediately. Yeah
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:22.160]   Uh, but boy this guy. I mean silent circle and black phone. Uh, we're well respected by the crypto community as uh,
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.520]   real ways to uh, do uh, uh,
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.440]   You know encryption that nobody could get into including governments. So apple
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:35.520]   Obviously continuing along the lines of this this this is a huge revolution that cuts across all companies apple is
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:41.360]   Doubling down against the against the government saying we are going to make sure that we are we are going to protect the phone so hard against
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:46.400]   ourselves that there is absolutely nothing we can possibly do to help anybody underneath circumstances
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.200]   There's also a rumblings that other companies like uh,
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:54.480]   Facebook and google particularly really want to hire in a lot of these people because they don't want
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.040]   Uh, they they want to they want to give their customers the greatest security
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.960]   possible, uh, that they that they themselves still have access to the company themselves
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:11.600]   Because one of the problems of hardening security against everybody else means that that's those are users that google can't see those are users that
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.080]   Facebook can't see and if they basically make things better for their users
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.400]   They also present for themselves from getting in the neck
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.520]   But they're also in the same sort of liability situation as as apple. It's not just doing good for their users
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:28.160]   There's also a lot of good hygiene involved in saying that we do not have the ability
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:35.200]   We are not going to be responsible for breaking into our own phones and for harvesting information from our customers that uh, the demands of government and uh, and uh,
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.320]   And other other forces because we simply do not have that capability
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.640]   You have to have that we are clean hands attitude that says that we were asking us to do something that
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.440]   Involves manufacturing a unicorn we would all like to have one but we can't manufacture one for you
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.920]   You have to figure out how to make that horse fly on your own
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.280]   Actually, I've uh already ordered a unicorn
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.160]   Toots the flying rainbow fucking unicorn
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:02.240]   And I should be getting that soon. That was an indiegogo project
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.760]   I will I would like to think that that's one of the nose uh that apple said
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.800]   That was a nose that let those good ideas
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.640]   Uh
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:15.200]   Well, we you know I I couldn't resist actually the the creator of toots the unicorn
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.560]   Brought him by the studio the other day and
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:25.280]   Golly, they're so close to their uh to their goal at 91 percent of their goal and sunshine
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.600]   And once i'm connected to the internet, I'll let you know what important things happen. The only way a unicorn knows how
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:35.200]   It uh
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.200]   locations as well as your favorite hashtag

[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:58.560]   We're thinking that uh every every time somebody and i'll do what unites sends us a nice tweet will have to its just
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.200]   Announce it. Yeah, but abadu
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.920]   Yeah, that's what kibson does
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.160]   I have a farting unicorn my friends
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:13.040]   Uh anything else that we missed before we take a break and go to our back of the book our final thoughts and uh picks
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.800]   Mmm
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.880]   Beautiful day. I'm sorry. Yeah lovely day lovely day and i'm wearing tie-dye
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.200]   What more could you ask for you are too?

[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:36.560]   Isn't the same Renee where's your be my tie-dye shirt? I am. I am so I am so disappointed
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.640]   I got a shirt for you actually Andy already has this one the gem and I dress shirt from ministry of
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:49.440]   Supply our sponsor today for mac break weekly dress smarter work smarter. This is a company created by
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:56.480]   Engineers from mit four years ago if you go to ministry of supply calm
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.640]   You can take a look at it ministry of supply dot com slash mac break. I'm wearing at just coincidentally
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.240]   The ministry of supply shorts. I ordered some months ago before
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.960]   They were a sponsor because I was looking for something kind of high tech
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.320]   That would that would give as I walked made out of really interesting material
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.080]   Um, the whole idea is to use high tech fabrics
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.040]   high tech design
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.040]   To give you a better
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.840]   Look and better clothes. They work with your body
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.760]   Instead of against it. They have work clothes. They have
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.320]   Sport clothes all of them designed by mit trained engineers
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.640]   To help regulate your body temperature keep you from getting too hot or too cold
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.640]   That's something that be mug tied. I just can't do
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:49.920]   Moisture wicking fibers that keep you dry they stretch so you move freely. I've never had a more comfortable pair of shorts
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.280]   I gotta say
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.600]   Uh, you cut the gem and I chinos
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.280]   That's the classic twill chino reengineer. They are there right there
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.920]   To move with you as you go through the day
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:06.400]   This is literally cotton blended with temperature regulating phase change materials
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.120]   This was invented at nasa folks
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:16.560]   It stores and releases body heat based on surrounding climate. You're basically weighing the same stuff astronauts wear
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.760]   Think of it as oh, how about this the dress shirt? I got one here
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:29.120]   This is beautiful. This is the archive dress shirt. So very very attractive. That's the gem and I button down
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.960]   That's what you got Andy, right?
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.960]   That's that's what I got and it's rich
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:37.760]   What I what I liked about it when it came is that uh, I should I should mention that
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.280]   I'm gonna back to your ministry of supply t-shirt. I was I was I was taking that because I want to do it
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.240]   Uh, you guys sent me like a gift certificate because you wanted you wanted we were talking about this last right again
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:52.000]   And so you wanted to send me one of these but the easier thing was sent a gift card
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.960]   So I got that this and the the gem and I shirt when it came in
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.560]   I really like these engineered shirts because you take it out of the box and it looks like a regular standard dress shirt
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.160]   But then you notice that the the cloth is a different type of fiber
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:09.680]   And also when you examine it close, I was looking at the stitching looking how nice the stitching was then notice that oh, there's not
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:14.000]   It's sort of like there's these micro perforations in places where you can't see
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.720]   To like add ventilation and there's these little vents in the back where it would normally sort of like a fold anyway
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:28.720]   So it's not just a thin material. It really is it really is like a almost like a like a race car where it's designed for airflow
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.720]   I don't know what my body shape would look like like in the in a wind tunnel, but
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.480]   And these and these and these and it's it's warm today. I went off for like a 10 mile bike ride this morning
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:45.040]   Uh, and if you're wearing cotton you are adding like three pounds of wet weight to your back
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.640]   And it just sticks to you
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:52.320]   But if you have an engineered shirt that definitely costs more than the four pack of of plain fruit of the loom t-shirts
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.640]   But the thing is like i'm wearing a very nice t-shirt and it's like i'm not wet at all. I'm completely dry
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.680]   I feel really cool. I've got a fan like underneath the table
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.760]   And I feel the cooling effect of the fan
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.600]   And so the extra money it's caused to buy an engineered shirt like this
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.080]   Is on a day like this. It's like that's why I spent the extra money. Yeah
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.840]   I bought these shorts because i've been walking to work a lot a couple of miles and it's about 85 degrees outside right now
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.960]   And I want something that would be stretchy and comfortable and they look great and you don't and they feel great
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:28.000]   And you don't look like um as somebody said summertime comes around there you're out. Those are the aviator shirts somewhere
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:35.760]   Summertime comes around and men start to dress like 12 year olds. I think they look a little more attractive a little more stylish and they sure feel good
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.160]   Uh the brushed interior on these shirts very comfortable against the skin
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.920]   I just also got these mercury sweaters. These are really nice. They're a really interesting mix of fabrics
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.920]   um
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.920]   the uh the marinow wool
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:55.120]   On the uh extra fine marinow will wicks moisture and controls the controls odor
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.520]   There's one of these that has like coffee in it to control odor. I can't remember which one
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.920]   It's they're really it's really kind of cool to see materials design come to shirts

[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.360]   athletically cut
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.440]   For a sport that I apparently do not do because it's
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:16.160]   I need a little bit of a looser cut right exactly I need a little bit more, you know room for smuggling
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.520]   Smuggling and shoplifting I
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.200]   Think you can't fit a ham under that shirt, Andy
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.520]   Exactly
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.520]   Ministry of supply dot com slash

[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.080]   I'm really happy with these. I got the I got a jacket
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.760]   I'm really
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.160]   This way by all this stuff before they said hey, we'd like to advertise I said oh good because I
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:42.400]   Have some of your clothes and I really like them
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.800]   With with that with that thing to a really long rattle
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.480]   I just want to say that one of the things that I learned in the past five years of
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:57.760]   Basically churning my wardrobe is that it's okay if the price of a certain garment throws you off because it's more than you usually spend
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:05.440]   It's okay to have like one or two copies of the really expensive t-shirt or the really expensive jacket or the really expensive pants and have the
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:13.040]   The regular rotation contain like the regular cotton pants or the regular t-shirt and you wear
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.400]   I'm going to wear this when it is like a day like this outside. Don't be very glad it's a day like this outside
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.520]   And when it's really cold, I will use this as like a base layer
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:28.160]   To insulate against as it's you don't have to make your entire wardrobe really expensive things
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.400]   But it's good to have like a balanced diet
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.560]   So that every time you wear you were recently your closet you can get exactly the thing that you need
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.360]   I agree. I agree
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:40.320]   Time for our picks of the week. Let's start with mr
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:43.920]   Nae ritchie from imore.com. What do you got for us today?
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.520]   So I've got an app and I have to admit up front that I don't listen to a lot of music
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.760]   So this app is traditionally would be lost on me like I just wouldn't be something that was on my radar
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.200]   But I know the developer. He's awesome. I've met him at wwdc several times mad abreast and I hope I'm pronouncing that right
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:01.920]   But then you know jim dallerumple was using it the last time I saw him in south bay a few weeks ago
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:04.800]   And dave mark who writes for the loop was raving about it
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:08.480]   So I I took a little bit of a deeper look and it's really really cool
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:14.480]   And he's always been very good at music apps and what this does you know is such a cliche to say it does what apple music should do
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.880]   But I think in many ways it does it just lets you sort of make apple music social in a way
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.440]   That's not connect at all but in a way that lets you
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:26.400]   Share songs with you know people who you're connected to but also build
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.800]   Playlists and share playlists
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.080]   It has a bunch of other features as well like you can look at clips of videos and things like that
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:37.120]   But really it's the collaborative social nature of the app if I'm looking for music and I'm not just you know
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.840]   For you does a pretty good job, but sometimes I want to see what jim is listening to or I want to see maybe what leo or
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.160]   What alex or andy or are listening to and if I follow you on this service
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:51.600]   I can really do that it was one was on people's wishlist for a long time that apple would basically just look at
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.040]   All your friends phones maybe and show you the most popular songs that were on there
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:00.320]   Lists that weren't on your list and to surface those for you and this is sort of a first step there
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:03.600]   It just takes it integrates really well with apple music you just hit
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:10.640]   The share button and it's a share extension right in there and it lets you share whatever you're listening to with everyone else in the sound share community
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.440]   But it's really where it is that you so what what is leo listening to what playlist can I build with andy
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.440]   Uh that makes it at least for me a much more enjoyable experience
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.160]   Like I can hit srenity and see that it's all hamilton all the time, but I can also see the other things
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.400]   But do we have to cooperate do I have to use it too?
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.800]   Yeah, I mean you do have to invite your friend so that is a bit of a barrier
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.160]   But I think if you are really musically and socially inclined
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:40.800]   This gives you functionality in a very direct and specific way that you just can't get from other like apps and
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   Read I think the best way to find music is to is to ask people. What do you listen to?
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.880]   This is this is be great
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.200]   Absolutely and like instagram, you know facebook and twitter and all of these have ability to share music
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:55.760]   But it just gets lost in the firehose and like instagram for photos if you just want music
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.720]   I know I can just go here and see what people whose opinions I value are listening to yeah
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.240]   Very nice sound share is it free?
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:08.720]   Uh, I'm on the beta, so i'm not sure but it is out now
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.040]   Typically yeah, typically social apps tend to be free, but i'll click on the button and see it my apologies
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:18.080]   No, that's all right. I didn't do that very good. So there it is. It is free as in free
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.600]   As in no cost. I think you have to do that for social apps
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.440]   So you just never build any critical rights right the whole key is to get get an audience in there
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.160]   Andy and not co your pick of the week
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:33.680]   Um, mine is kind of an oddball thing. I'm a bit i'm a big fan of a youtube channel called tech mone
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.080]   I can't remember tc h m o a and he's the so
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.320]   uh, british guy. I think he's in manchester who does these really cool like little
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:46.800]   uh reviews of cameras and stuff like that really really nice and uh,
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.160]   And so he reviewed this thing such a weird thing. It's called this
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.560]   the so shine
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.320]   uh six led light and here's what it is you you got you have
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.720]   Like a bunch of it's a it's a chinese thing
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.240]   You buy you get a pack of like a half a dozen of these things for like a buck and a half each
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.040]   And this is all it is it is a usb
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.640]   Device that has six super bright leds in it
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:15.680]   And so if you put it into any usb port you get like this really
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:24.080]   Really intense light and the cool thing is that it's not just a light and so you go you're already see like how bright it is
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.480]   Like here's actually I should probably have had that set up like as a lighting system
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.400]   For this show since I have my temporary lighting things going uh, but uh, you
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:39.360]   There is also a touch sensor on the back of it so that you can have it if you hold it down it will actually dim
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.840]   There is no manual. There you go
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:48.080]   And you can actually tap it again to actually set a certain light letting light setting and then when you unplug it and plug it back in again
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:54.800]   It will then remember that setting and go back to exactly that same setting when you tap it and turn it back on again
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.320]   uh, and
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:00.720]   First of all the first great feature of it is it's like again like a buck 25
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.000]   Each in a pack of six and but it's tiny enough that you may as you know
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.080]   You've got this drawer full of like old like usb phone chargers that you never use anymore like the little marshmallow ones
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.000]   Well, how about you just plug that into like a kitchen socket or like a hall socket
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.680]   And this is now just a night light or how about you have this like in your wallet or in your laptop bag
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.760]   Because I almost always have a phone charger with me
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:31.040]   And if I ever need like an extra source of light I can just simply pluck this out or pretty much anytime you need a little bit of extra light
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.080]   Somewhere I was actually actually had one I bought two packs
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.760]   Which means that you again a buck 25 so you may as well just like put them wherever
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:43.440]   I actually had one plugged into the back of my tv in order has that usb diagnostic port
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.880]   And it's always on but it's consuming like no power pretty much
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.600]   And so basically whenever I need to change cables
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.480]   There's always like a little like downwash like that is
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.080]   Illuminating the labels for like all the different things that I'm plugging in
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.680]   And I just I just like it because I love dirt cheap little things that work well
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:06.480]   And it get granted. There's no there's no case. There's no logo
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.360]   There's no nothing
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:13.360]   But I bet that you could like get an action figure and like hollow it out and put this in the back and have like your batman
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.760]   Your batman or your wonder woman nightlight usb nightlight. I like it
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.640]   It doesn't it doesn't uh
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.320]   fart rainbows like your upcoming usb not everything but can be
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.240]   Amazing but yeah, but for buck 25 you can make whatever you want
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.880]   Xcreek whatever you want
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:39.040]   With with bright light. I imagine they're using something like that in addition to a fog machine to create wow is bright. Holy cow
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.240]   It's actually kind of at maximum setting. It's actually kind of painful to look at wow, but you can really give it no
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.360]   Is there anything they can't do? I got you think this is
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.880]   You can't imagine the difference between growing up having a having a
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:59.520]   Camping lantern as a kid where it takes this huge like like a box of a boot box size battery
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:02.240]   And if you left it on when you fell asleep reading a comic book
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.720]   It was dead and it cost you another eight dollars and it wasn't that right?
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.480]   Right versus this thing that will light up my entire room
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.040]   And I could leave it on for four days during a blackout and I even bothered to turn it off and it will still uh
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.040]   You kiss today you you live in a world of wonders and I hope you're grateful for all the
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.920]   Even appreciated my god
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.640]   By the way, I bought those crazy precision steel one two three blocks that you recommended last week and I love them
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.840]   Yeah, I got the tin was the titanium
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.640]   They're just they're just
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.320]   So cool and you're right covered with machine oil. So I had to brush them off. I'm using
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.880]   I have some fun. I have cream cam 3000 the future video podcasting hooked up
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.680]   Here's what I've got like they're using for like right now
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.560]   I've got like my my beverage here, but I don't want to accidentally like spill it on my thing
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.160]   So I've actually just have it here so that if I happen to like not get over
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.120]   It's not gonna. It's not gonna knock over these really cool steel boxes. It's like a confirm for pants
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.840]   Yeah, there you go
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.440]   Uh, I there's so many fun things to talk about
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:07.760]   Uh, I wasn't sure what to pick this week
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.680]   But I have for a long time recommended and used it which started with think I like having a package manager
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   Oh, no s 10. It lets me install
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.840]   Uh other useful unixy command line style tools. Think was a long time favorite
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:29.360]   They kind of got superseded by home brew, which I probably still recommend is b re w dot s h
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.600]   Easy to install and uh, it lets you install using a simple command brew
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:38.000]   A lot of other
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.360]   Useful utilities that don't come with os 10 or update things like if you want to
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.640]   OS 10 comes with an old version of python you want to get a newer version
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:52.880]   I found a really fun command line utility b python 3 that lets me do python 3 at the command line
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:55.120]   It's really cool all of that's available at home brew
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.280]   But there's a new one that I think it has some real features to recommend
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.840]   And if you haven't yet settled on home brew
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.200]   Take a look at nix nix nix that's nix o s dot org
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.080]   Uh, and this actually is both linux and os 10
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:18.960]   It doesn't have the variety of packages that home brew or a think had but it is growing very rapidly because
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:24.640]   It's a package manager that is used very widely and it does something very smart, which is
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.680]   Uh, it keeps all of your installed
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:33.360]   Uh apps in a single folder and it's very easy to uninstall them
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.920]   So they don't mess up your system home brew and think both do that a little bit
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.160]   But this is even more better, uh frankly than than either of those so
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.880]   The packages are somewhat limited but for a lot of people that isn't a problem because
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:52.720]   Um, you know if it's got the packages you care about then then it's doesn't matter that it has a thousand more
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.440]   So nix is part of a larger os
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:02.640]   distribution, but uh nix the package manager is available for os 10 and works quite nicely
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.320]   So if you're interested in that kind of thing, uh check it out
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.800]   nix os.org/nix
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.960]   Uh, but if you don't have that home brew you should have one of them
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.560]   I mean, how else you gonna put emax on your os 10 machine, right?
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.280]   Right right?
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.000]   Thank you, rinette by the way
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]   spaces or tabs
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.680]   Consider it because the wrong answer could get you booted out of this show
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.320]   Did you see silicon valley maybe you I hearing dead silence on either of you
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:39.600]   So in the valley i only watch it when i don't get the hbo
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:45.920]   Okay, never mind people at home. You know what i'm talking about rinette richie i'm more dot com
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:52.880]   Great to have you all the great podcasts and the great writing you've done a million words and go in strong
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:58.800]   i'm more dot com he's on the uh twitter at re n-e r-i-t-c-h-i-e
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:04.160]   Four spaces will confuse this people for a tab leo that's what i'm going for yes, well there's a well
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:08.800]   I don't know spoilers, but uh but uh it becomes an issue
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:12.240]   Four non-break spaces or asky variants. There we go
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:16.560]   I know i want it at one point
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:22.160]   So uh, who's the who's the head of a pied piper? You know the gangly funny guy?
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:27.200]   I don't remember his name, but anyway, he's he's like adam it. Why would you use spaces?
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:33.440]   Instead of tab yeah, I and then i understand his girlfriend says because
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:39.040]   You don't know what tab will look different on depending on the machine and what the tab's setting to you have to use spaces
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.560]   He says but that's four keystrokes. He says i'm all about file compression
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.480]   So he tries to demonstrate it to her by taking
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.320]   the stairs eight steps at a time as
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:53.920]   And it doesn't end well
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:02.080]   He also uses emax all right and andy naco from the chicago sun times a great pet richard. That's it richard great pleasure
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.120]   Thank you
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:10.960]   For their their their kinds of engineers for whom the ease of solution is to force the entire everyone in the entire world to use a monospace
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.480]   font there you go
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:19.840]   I'm not i'm not one of those people so I would tabs that's tabs it was almost my uh actually pick of the week was a monospace
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.760]   font called hack I collect I have a folder of programming fonts. I collect them. Oh great great
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:29.520]   right stands source code pro don't use don't use monoco
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.840]   really
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:37.600]   Come on. There's so much better out there in consolata, but hack is a nice one. It's one i've been using lately
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.760]   uh
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.320]   This is turning into the terminal show sf mono next week sf mono. That's the one
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:47.920]   Every every time we talk about this instead of some lawsuit
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.600]   We we we we push the eject button on two different lawsuit stories
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.600]   And we everyone is saying thank god
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:53:01.440]   They just acknowledge it exists and that there's something better to talk about like mono space fonts and marvel movies when they make a mono space comic
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.520]   Sands then my life will be complete
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.400]   Probably somebody already has comic
