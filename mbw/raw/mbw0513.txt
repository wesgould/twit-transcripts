[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.480]   a little bit of rumors.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.120]   We'll talk about the new Mac OS, what ending production
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.840]   of the Thunderbolt display might mean if Apple is really
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.280]   going to dump the headphone port a lot more.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.320]   I'm going to bring you the coming up next.

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.600]   because I have questions, lots of questions.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.080]   And these guys have lots of answers.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.520]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.800]   It's really actually seven days a week, I think.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.960]   Oh, I got to ask Renee that.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.640]   I'm right here, Leo.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.480]   I'll answer all the questions.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.920]   Renee knows everything.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.440]   Also here, Andy Inaco.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.120]   Who knows everything Renee doesn't know.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.560]   And he's from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.040]   Great to have you.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.160]   And oh, we're so glad to see Alex Lindsey from--
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   From San Rafael, California.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.020]   I know.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.680]   The picture's amazing, considering you're in Marin.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   Exactly.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.760]   We don't really invest in that.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   It's mostly--
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.440]   I expect much more from Rwanda and Washington, DC
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.960]   than from Marin County, said.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.440]   Yes.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.640]   Yes.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.320]   We have better connections in both of those locations.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.040]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.720]   How's things--
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.240]   Good to be here.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.120]   Gosh, I don't know where to start.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.680]   Let me ask the question that I was asking yesterday on iOS
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.840]   today, and maybe got wrong.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   But it's about differential privacy on device data
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.600]   and photo recognition.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.360]   And maybe, Renee, you can explain how this works.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.040]   Apple hasn't really fully documented
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.920]   what is going to go on an iOS 10.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.280]   But they have said between differential privacy
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.520]   and on device labor analysis, we don't have to violate your privacy
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.200]   in the way that Google photos, for instance.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.480]   Does Apple's photos already will identify people, right?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.160]   That's that Rosetta stuff they bought years ago.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.320]   And that's done--
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.040]   not on the cloud.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.120]   That's done on your computer.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.560]   Yeah, that was-- they bought a company that was really good at that.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.280]   And I'm blank on the name.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.360]   It was Rose, something or other.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.600]   And they bundled that in.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.520]   But then, now, if they were to extend that to photos--
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000]   today, if you-- when you do that, if you did that--
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.560]   can you do that on iOS and photos on iOS?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.520]   You couldn't up until iOS 10.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.200]   That was maybe--
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.700]   OK.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.120]   It would sink over the photos that you identified with faces
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.600]   on your Mac, but it wouldn't do any on iOS device.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.400]   We can do additional recognition.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.600]   In iOS 10, it will.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.040]   Yes.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   And it will do that on device only.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.440]   And it's not clear to me the process for all of that.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.880]   So one of the things that's really key to understand analysts
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.720]   is that it's in a beta.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.880]   And Apple has made huge changes to the way
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   that privacy and AI works in previous years.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.320]   For example, in iOS 9, they announced this feature where
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.960]   they were going to start polling all your friends to see
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   what apps they use most so that they could recommend those
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   to you if you ever posted a question that had an answer
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.040]   and an app you hadn't downloaded yet.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.480]   And they were doing all this thing--
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   all these different tests to make sure that it was public data,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.840]   not private data.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.320]   And they would sample a group of people.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.880]   And if all of them had similar data,
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.280]   then they would consider that to be public and not private.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.200]   But then they came up with edge cases.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.640]   And eventually, I don't think that feature shipped at all
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.160]   during the period of time between the beta and the release.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.200]   They scaled it back once.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.760]   And I think they scaled it back totally
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.560]   because they couldn't guarantee the privacy.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.160]   So what we're seeing here is the same thing.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.120]   They have these ideas.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.880]   And they're in the beta.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.720]   And they're tested internally at Apple.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.760]   And now they're going out to thousands of developers.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.640]   And I think that early data will sort of shape what Apple
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.600]   actually does with this.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.360]   And then we'll end up seeing it in the iOS 10 security
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.840]   white paper.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.160]   Because here's what I know from-- yeah.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.200]   And of course, we have to wait for that white paper.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.880]   And they've been pretty forthcoming with details
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.760]   on previous white papers.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.200]   So presumably, they'll tell us more.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.480]   But here's what I know about machine learning,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.680]   which is you throw mountains of data at it
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.200]   before it can really do things like recognize
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.560]   Pekingese dogs.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   And what Apple's saying is we'll use mountains of data
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.360]   for our machine learning.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.720]   It won't be your mountain of data.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.280]   It'll be general internet Pekingese dogs.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.720]   Not your specific Pekingese dog.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.520]   And so the reason the edge case for me is face recognition
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.080]   is obviously that's got to be your data.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.720]   It can't be somebody else's data.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.760]   So I saw one theory.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.360]   And I don't know if it's true or not,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.880]   because again, they haven't provided details.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.520]   But it was cross-referencing the faces
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.120]   provided in your contacts.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.880]   And it was enough data in there for just
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.480]   making educated guesses about those faces appearing
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.400]   in other photographs.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.680]   And then because that was local-- like,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.320]   your contacts are local to your device.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.760]   And those photos are local on your device.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.920]   If I have a good picture of Andy in my contacts,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.760]   it could start assuming that the other photos it finds
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.360]   would also be Andy.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.960]   And in fact, it's my understanding also.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.120]   And as you could tell, my understanding is weak.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.080]   But my understanding also is that face recognition
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.560]   is a different kind of machine learning.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.080]   Recognizing a generic concept like Pekingese or Mountain
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.000]   require is much more sophisticated,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.440]   because there's all different kinds of Pekingese
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   and mountains.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.160]   But face recognition really is based on some kind of simple things
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.440]   like the distance, inter-pupillary distance,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.120]   and how long your nose is.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.080]   And so simple measurements there can be made quickly and easily
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.960]   with a good picture, and then added to with several more good
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.200]   pictures to the point where you can be pretty confident
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.680]   in your face recognition.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.200]   So it doesn't require the massive data.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.880]   No, and again, it's because it's your data.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.760]   And because Apple's silicon is so good,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.240]   I think they can do billions and billions of processes
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.400]   very, very quickly on device.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.240]   And the fact that face recognition, for instance,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.200]   in Windows Hello works with just one picture
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.120]   tells you that it doesn't need masses of data.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.800]   And it doesn't probably even need masses of computation.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.960]   That's a much simpler thing to do than kind of generic
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   recognition.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.560]   I guess the real-- the important detail for me,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.320]   and I'll open this to everybody, the important detail for me
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.120]   is the devil is in the details.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.400]   It's all in the implementation.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.280]   It's got to be good.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.920]   You have kind of-- and this is what Matthew Green,
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.040]   the cryptographer at Johns Hopkins, pointed out--
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.480]   you have a kind of a scale where if you make it more private,
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.280]   it's less useful.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.040]   If you make it less private, it's more useful.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.440]   And differential privacy is a slider.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.360]   And so the question is, you can say,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.480]   I'm using differential privacy and still not
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.200]   do a great job in protecting people's privacy.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.080]   Or you can use differential privacy
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.800]   and not get a lot of useful data out of it.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.680]   So here's what we know now.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.200]   First of all, if you want Apple to start doing that,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.640]   you will opt into it.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.960]   So unless you explicitly say in iOS 10,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.560]   please start looking at my data and giving me insights from it.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.720]   It won't do that at all, right?
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.280]   That's what they're saying now, yeah.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.040]   This recode got some clarifications,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.600]   I imagine you also guys have asked Apple and so forth.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.120]   They also say they won't use cloud photos for image recognition.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.680]   They're going to rely on other data sets.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.280]   And then they were kind of--
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.840]   what's interesting is what they said they're
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.760]   going to use this differential privacy for.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.880]   It will be limited to four specific use cases.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.280]   I don't know if this is from the interview
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.680]   that John Gruber did on the talk show or where they got this.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.840]   But new words that users add to their local dictionaries.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.080]   So in other words, you add to your dictionary
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.880]   might be added to other people's dictionaries
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.040]   minus the identifying information.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.240]   Emojis typed by the user.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.200]   So they're going to learn in this emoji replacement thing
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.040]   they're doing.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.720]   They're going to get better at it by using, again,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.040]   privatized information.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.440]   I don't know what the word is.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.200]   Privatized information.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.000]   Deep links inside apps, as long as they're
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   marked for public indexing, and look up hints within notes.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.680]   So this is a very constrained--
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.240]   And that was the hard thing last year.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.680]   The deep links is what really flummoxed them,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.760]   because they had a lot of things they wanted to do with it
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.320]   and just could not ensure the privacy.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.640]   And I think that was a big impetus for developing.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.840]   And Apple said themselves that they
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.080]   will use different degrees of this.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.880]   For example, if we're in a bustling city,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.120]   they don't have to add too much noise,
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.280]   because there's so many different samples that's coming in.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.840]   But if you're relatively by yourself on a farm,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.240]   it's very hard to hide who you are.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.800]   So they're going to be increasing the noise.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.680]   And I think that slider is going to be applied a little bit
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.560]   dynamically.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.920]   And I think it's also encouraging, although discouraging.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.120]   It's encouraging and discouraging that they're using such
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.480]   a limited subset as they start.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.760]   And they say, as we begin-- and I think
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.680]   that's to make sure that they can do this safely,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.600]   and anonymously, by the way, anonymized
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.160]   would be the word I was looking for.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.400]   And that's very much a part for the course for Apple.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.640]   Remember the first time that Apple's long background
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.960]   processes to run, they would say we will allow a third party
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.200]   app to do the following limited things in the background.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.760]   And it really had things to do with music playback.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.360]   Navigation, stuff like that.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.080]   They were going to simply open up everything, willy-nilly.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.440]   Hopefully, this means that they're only
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.160]   going to let happen things that they feel as though they can
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.640]   manage very, very well.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.960]   And then maybe they'll add to that skill set as they go along.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.760]   This really is brand new stuff.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.040]   And part of it is protecting privacy.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.360]   The other part of it is just simply understanding exactly
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.000]   how you can deliver meaningful results.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.600]   So it's possible that Apple is way ahead of the curve here
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.000]   in saying, well, why are we assuming
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.680]   that we have to compromise privacy to some extent?
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.120]   In order to make this happen, it's also possible
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.280]   that they're trying to make the most delicious, absolutely
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.680]   succulent, and yummy vegetarian burrito ever, which
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.200]   is going to please the people who care about not eating meat.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.960]   But everyone else who is happy to eat meat is going to say, OK,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.360]   well, good for you.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.600]   You're very proud of this.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.720]   Great.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.240]   Happy that you're happy.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.520]   But it's going to be in the results, not in the making
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.200]   the results.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.240]   Clearly, Apple has identified a large sector,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.880]   a large group of people who want this particular kind of privacy
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.440]   and will be very happy with that vegetarian burrito.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.560]   And they see that as a--
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.080]   Well, I think it's also really part of their core branding
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.560]   at this point.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.920]   So I mean, privacy-- so cutting the new ground in privacy
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.320]   is going to be something I think we're
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.680]   going to see over and over for you in from Apple.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.800]   This is part of what they're really pushing as far
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.080]   as their marketing goes.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.960]   I hope that works out.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.760]   But remember that a tactile keyboard
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.480]   was part of Blackberry's core branding.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.680]   And again, they make great tactile keyboards,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.040]   but it wasn't necessarily what people were caring about five
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   years later.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.080]   Yes.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.240]   I mean, as the only component, probably so.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.440]   I mean, I think the two things were absolute privacy
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.960]   and for Blackberry and tactile keyboard.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.520]   And those things have still kept them--
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.240]   I mean, I just saw a bunch of them yesterday or last week.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   A bunch of Blackberries.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.800]   In certain sectors of the government and so on and so forth,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.880]   there's a lot of-- there's still a lot of Blackberries.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.360]   That's an excellent point, though.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.640]   And I think that you make Andy, which is they are giving up
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.400]   something here.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.760]   And it may be something--
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.320]   I mean, maybe most people want carnitas.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.880]   Well, it's just that--
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.960]   I think privacy is not an absolute.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.640]   I think every people has a sliding level.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.600]   I'm like, I'm like, what the burrito?
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   I mean--
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.640]   No.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.560]   Sorry.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.800]   I think that most people have sort of their own personal level
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.760]   of what they want, what they're willing to give up
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.080]   versus what they think is sacrosanct.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.520]   I mean, there are some people that--
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.160]   in their houses, they want to have--
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.680]   they want privacy, but they also want
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.880]   to have big windows that led in natural light.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.120]   And they want to be able to look out into the windows
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.240]   and see into the kids playing into the street.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.160]   And they're willing to let people see in if they get that thing.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.480]   If Apple or any other company went so far as to say,
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.560]   nope, you're welcome.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.520]   We bricked over every aperture in your entire house.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.640]   Nobody can possibly see in your privacy
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.720]   secure that may not necessarily be what people want.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.080]   But the great thing is that this isn't as absolute as that.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.760]   If Apple can really deliver on--
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.160]   what the potential that they're sort of describing here,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   meaning that we can give you results that are as good as Google.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.360]   And Google results for tailoring your experience
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.000]   to your needs are fantastic.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.560]   If they can do that while having a level of privacy that
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.040]   is higher than the level of privacy
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.120]   that Google already affords you, great.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   Otherwise, it's going to be people deciding,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.840]   do I want to--
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.560]   Am I-- are these Apple features good enough
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.720]   that I no longer sort of look at my wife when she swipes left
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.760]   and sees a Google now page that has every piece of information
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.040]   she needs at that instant.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.160]   And I know that Apple doesn't do that because it's
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   looking out for my privacy.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.800]   Proteus said a really interesting thing in the chairman.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.200]   He said, if you can be secure and private and deliver
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.840]   meaning for results, then Google is going to look like a bad guy.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   Like, they've overstepped because they didn't need to.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   On the other hand, if you don't, there's
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.160]   going to be, on the one hand, temptation on Apple's part
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.560]   to kind of turn that knob a little bit more
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.040]   towards the less anonymized side.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.560]   I mean, I think people are going to start expecting Siri
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.840]   to be as smart as Echo and so forth.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.080]   And if it doesn't do that kind of stuff,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.480]   they might-- he also says, Siri-- Siri
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.720]   accused from ATP to test on a search for his PlayStation 3
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.840]   controller in his library.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.080]   He identified the backside of a game controller
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.640]   by searching for it in the new photos app by iOS 10.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.400]   That's interesting.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.160]   Is that John Syracuse that did that and on ours Technica?
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.960]   It's true that you may not realize what your photos reveal.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.680]   You saw the picture of Mark Zuckerberg, where he just
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.400]   thought he was posting an innocuous photo of him
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:58.720]   celebrating Instagram's half billion users or likes
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.400]   or whatever it is.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.200]   But people zoomed in on his picture
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.480]   and noticed that his camera-- I mean,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.400]   you have to really zoom in on this--
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   that his camera on his laptop is covered with tape.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.840]   And his microphone port is covered as well.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.880]   And that he uses Thunderbird as an email client.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.680]   So look at all the information he inadvertently
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.960]   revealed with his simple picture.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.200]   Oh, did he-- what's that information that he cares about?
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.520]   Maybe not.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.400]   But that's the point is that it's not
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.560]   easy to protect and anonymize information.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.200]   Well, I think that the big thing--
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.080]   I think the most important part of this revolution
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.200]   isn't necessarily Apple or Google
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.860]   doing more things to introduce privacy and secrecy
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.480]   into their features.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.600]   I think it's mostly people being aware of how much data
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.760]   they can leak out.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.960]   Situations like this.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.520]   One of the reasons why I have my set up the way I do
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.960]   is because I want it to look clean and also
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.760]   I want you to not see how messy that core of the office is.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.680]   But another one of those things is
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   that I don't want to accidentally have left a device out
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.560]   that I should not have or a present from somebody
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.800]   that's not necessarily for public consumption.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.920]   The fact that I've got a studio with lights and a camera
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.520]   means that when I'm in this room, I'm very aware.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.640]   And I think that there's going to be sort of a subconscious use
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.200]   of that as people go out and about in the world for that one.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.400]   We used to have a sign somewhere in very fine print.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.320]   I guess it's still over there that says, hey, you know,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.520]   if you're in this studio, you're on the air.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.320]   Don't tell your boss you're going for lunch.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.240]   You've run a step.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.120]   It's definitely one of the things that I think about when
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.680]   I post.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.520]   I post everything publicly.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.840]   I don't post anything privately.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.680]   And mostly it's a mindset.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.040]   I started when a path came out and I started posting stuff
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.520]   that was more above my kids or more personal.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.720]   And I just don't know if I want to--
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.120]   No, you were smart.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.720]   I got bit--
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.600]   --of thinking that it was safe.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.640]   I got bit because I was following somebody in path.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.360]   And I mentioned something they posted on a path.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.400]   And I had forgotten that that was a more constrained social
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:07.760]   network.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.120]   I thought this was public knowledge.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.320]   And the guy got mad at me.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.880]   And I rightly so.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.520]   Right.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:12.720]   Right.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.880]   And so I just like thinking if I'm going to post something
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.120]   or I'm going to do something online, I'm OK with that.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.080]   Being public.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.040]   Like I think about it all the time.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.560]   I think about it fairly constantly.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.280]   Should I do this search?
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.800]   Should I-- you know, it's one of those things
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.720]   like I know I'm building a profile somewhere.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.120]   And so it's just a matter of thinking through that process.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.440]   All right.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.840]   We're going to take a break and make you even more hungry.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.760]   Andy Inako is here.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.440]   The king of the metaphor.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.080]   You're so good at that, Andy.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.360]   But your burrito got me going.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.600]   That's Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.800]   King of audio, video, and all.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.200]   Now I'm out of order.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.680]   There's Andy Inako.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.920]   Now here's Alex Lindsey.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   Sorry, Carsten.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.560]   I'm really challenging you today.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.560]   Why don't you blend them together,
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.520]   see what the face recognition algorithm says.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   Alex Lindsey-- oh, look.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.120]   Move over a little bit.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.320]   They're the same person.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.120]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.200]   Actually, your metrics are exactly the same.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:12.680]   Look at that.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.280]   That's why Andy wears a hat.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.400]   So is there like a White House face scanner
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:16.920]   that I could blow up?
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.960]   Shave the mutton chops you never know.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.880]   Oh, so it's not worth that.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.720]   No, no.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.160]   Let's not go that far.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.920]   And for mymore.com, Mr. Renee Richie,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.000]   I want to-- we're going to talk about speculation
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.760]   in a moment.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.160]   Headphone ports, thunderbolt displays, and more.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.920]   It's idiots having to give you all our social networks
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.520]   when you cross the border in the near future.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.200]   Is that wild?
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.160]   They say it's optional.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.160]   Yes.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.000]   It's-- there's--
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Just like when you get pulled over by a cop,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.920]   declining the cops.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.280]   We kind of look at the retron-- that's optional too.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.760]   That means that they would say that you're perfectly fine.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.240]   Why don't we wait for two or three hours
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.040]   until we get a court order to bring some guys--
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.520]   I'm going to be so much more careful with my jokes
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.480]   on Twitter for you.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.560]   So this is in the immigration-- not immigration,
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.920]   but the customs form as you cross the border in the US,
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.360]   it says, what is your online presence?
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.920]   Give us your--
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.560]   give us the links to your online presence.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.720]   And of course, that's all--
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.560]   I'm sure that that's all driven from extremism.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   That's a good friend.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.040]   We want to see if you have any extremist tweets.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.920]   I post extreme food pictures.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.360]   That's OK.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.480]   So what are all these watch bands?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.920]   Is it some sort of color code about signal to the--
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.200]   Rose Gold.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.240]   What does that really mean?
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.360]   I like Americans' watch bands.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.000]   Will you fill that out or just ignore it?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.080]   I guess it depends how it's presented to me.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.120]   I'm on Nexus.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.720]   I'm probably going to--
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   Oh, you won't see it.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.840]   It's probably going to be demanded of me next time
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.440]   I already might have my Nexus card.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.800]   You won't see it.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.640]   Oh, maybe it will, like in the pre-interview.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.600]   Holy cow.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.320]   I can't say it's a bad thing, but it does feel a little intrusive.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.720]   It feels a little bit--
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.960]   I'm sure there's great information,
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.120]   but it also feels a little bit fluffy,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.280]   because I think most people are just--
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.440]   What's your Twitter account?
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.280]   So it's going to work.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.320]   This is a proposal submitted by the US Department
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.520]   of Homeland Security.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.400]   Please enter information associated
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.440]   with your online presence.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.000]   And then it provides room for provider, platform,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.360]   and social media identifier.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.720]   On Twitter.com, I am at terrorist.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.280]   And then--
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.520]   At Lungly Boy 97?
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.840]   Lungly Boy 97.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.400]   Well, but I don't understand.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.280]   It wouldn't take very much to find that information.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.440]   I find it odd that they would--
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.920]   like if it was really a security concern,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.960]   it wouldn't be very hard to find it.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.520]   I guess the other thing they'd be looking at
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.200]   is they could be looking at how many things you bought overseas,
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.240]   and then you came back and you tweeted it,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.120]   and this is all this--
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.880]   Yeah, did your Twitter stream line up
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.320]   to your customs declaration?
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.360]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.400]   So do you feel like you're watching the actual--
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   I'm going to do some work--
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.440]   I'm going to do some work in Vancouver or in Australia.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.400]   And so you say that, and then you show up, and you say,
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.440]   well, I'm just here for tourism.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.040]   That becomes more complicated.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.120]   So beyond just the extremism, there's definitely other things
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.200]   that they could be trying to do there.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.760]   You could just say, I don't have a Twitter account,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.680]   I don't have a Facebook account.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   But then would you be lying--
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   What's the federal--
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   On your form?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.920]   You can't lie.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.440]   Or can't--
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.480]   There's a line that gets you, Leo.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.320]   It's never the crime.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:26.680]   It's a lie.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.000]   Is it?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.960]   You can't use the word up.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.400]   There's a little bit of a chilling effect.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.320]   You might really change what you say on your Twitter and Facebook.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.120]   Absolutely.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.000]   And Alex is right.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.640]   It's like they could find these things so easily.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.880]   It's a little bit extra galling if their attitude is now like,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.560]   I don't want to get out of my chair.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.000]   I'm going to just hold the knife right here.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.120]   Could you just run at it really fast, but throat high?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   OK.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.840]   It's like, no, if you--
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.320]   Anyway, it is only a proposal, and I guess you can comment.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.040]   If you want.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:03.080]   It's docket number USCPB-2007-0102.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.120]   Proposed collection.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.040]   Comment request.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.480]   Can anybody comment on these?
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.560]   It's at the federal register.gov.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.760]   Please leave your email along the way.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.160]   And your social connection.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.680]   I mean, you're really mad.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   I don't know.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.320]   I don't think it's a bad--
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   I understand.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   I don't want to get mad.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   Yep.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.800]   Ah.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.200]   I just feel like it's going to get harder and harder
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.520]   to leave the country, or go.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.480]   And for you, Renee, you're going to be stuck in Montreal.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.480]   You poor--
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.040]   We were pre-tenexited.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.360]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.400]   Blue Apron's mission to make incredible home cooking
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.280]   accessible to everyone, supporting a more sustainable food
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.080]   system, setting the highest standards for ingredients,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.560]   and building a community of home chefs.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.400]   What's wrong with that?
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.600]   And toward that end, they want to give you
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.800]   your first three meals free.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.360]   Blue Apron-- we've talked about it before.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.200]   I love Blue Apron.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.120]   These refrigerated boxes come to your door.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.920]   The problem is I love to cook.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.120]   It's fun, but it's intimidating, right?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.000]   And I end up cooking the same four things over and over,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.360]   because I know how to do it.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.880]   And then there's the shopping issue.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.440]   You're tired after a long day of work.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.560]   You want to go to the store and pick up ingredients.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.240]   Well, what a great feeling when that Blue Apron box
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.360]   is on my doorstep.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.000]   I open it up and everything I need, exactly what I need.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.160]   No more, no less, is available.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.920]   I open it up.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.760]   The meats are fresh.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.800]   The fish is fresh, never frozen.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.320]   The produce is from local sustainable farms.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.720]   It's delicious.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.680]   And it's a recipe I may never have thought of cooking,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.640]   but they make it easy.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.280]   They give you a beautiful recipe card.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.080]   There's even videos if you have questions about techniques
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.840]   online on the Blue Apron site.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.440]   They deliver now to 99% of the continental United States,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.080]   but you can find out at blueapron.com/twit
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.240]   if they can deliver to you.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.120]   And while you're there, check it out.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.600]   Look what's on the menu this week.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.000]   Empanadas de Pecadillo with tomato cucumber salad and lima
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.480]   beans.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.920]   Wow, that looks so good.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.160]   How about ginger pork burgers with black bean mayo
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.200]   and fooda caca-dressed green beans?
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.520]   I don't know what fooda caca is, but you're going to learn.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.680]   And that's the beauty part.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.400]   You're going to use ingredients maybe you've never even
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.880]   used or thought of or heard of before.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   And then you'll say, oh, yeah, I love that stuff.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.000]   I love that for a caca.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.800]   I'd like some more.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:27.000]   Cava toppy pasta and arugula pesto--
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.520]   oh, this sounds like a great summer meal--
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.600]   with summer squash and ricotta salata.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.520]   It's so much fun.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   And they have plans for couples, but also family plans
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.600]   with kid-friendly ingredients.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.720]   And that's a great way to get your kids cooking and build
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.480]   the bonds and sit down to a meal and talk.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.000]   Talk.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.800]   Look at each other.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   It's incredible.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.600]   Here's the deal.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.800]   Go to blueapron.com/twit.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.880]   Check out this week's menu.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.720]   And your first three meals now, your first three meals,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.960]   are free.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.880]   And that's free shipping, too.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.480]   You'll love how good it feels and tastes
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.040]   to create incredible home-cooked meals.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.000]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.640]   I hate doing this ad.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.040]   Not because I don't love Blue Apron.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.360]   I do.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.800]   We get the box all the time.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.440]   But because it makes me so hungry.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.640]   Makes you so hungry.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.480]   I love Blue Apron right now.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.120]   [SIGHS]
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:22.360]   Andy Inako, Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsay, Alex, what did you
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.120]   think when you saw that Apple has not only discontinued
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.160]   the Thunderbolt monitor but says there
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.920]   are plenty of wonderful third party options
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.120]   for your delectation?
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.080]   Well, they're either--
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.760]   obviously, they're either coming up with another monitor,
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.320]   which I think would be most likely,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.880]   or they have decided to get out of the business, which
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.520]   seems a little crazy.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.600]   Is it crazy?
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.360]   So maybe not.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.800]   I know Renee's written about this,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.440]   but isn't a monitor-- first of all,
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.480]   Apple has not kept up with anybody else, right?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.560]   Their monitors are more expensive than anybody else's.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   They leapt ahead with IPS and then they stopped.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.480]   And they don't even--
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.320]   I mean, most of their profit computers
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.400]   don't even need a monitor.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.840]   And I will admit that we don't have any of their monitors.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.840]   I think it's the old ones.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.040]   Now that I look back on them, I'm like,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.440]   I don't think we have any of their monitors.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.360]   I mean, we buy right now, I think,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.080]   the monitor of choice at the moment is like these--
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.040]   I think we have these Asus 4K monitors.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.160]   They're like little 24-inch, super sharp.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.880]   We bought a lot of--
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.560]   but yeah, I don't think that we really consider it,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.720]   but partially because it's fallen behind,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.120]   as far as quality and resolution and everything else.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.920]   And we don't really buy anything that's not 4K.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.960]   I think the weird thing is the statement
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.280]   that they gave you, Renee.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.480]   We're discontinuing the Apple Thunderbolt display.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.960]   It'll be available through Apple.com, Apple's Retail Stores,
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.080]   and Apple Authorized Resource.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.200]   While supplies last, this is the sentence that puzzled me.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   There are a number of great third party options
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.520]   available for Mac users.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.160]   That sounds like a company getting out of the business.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.760]   Well, I mean, there's two things here.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.960]   One is that they were still producing these things,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.320]   which meant that they were running a factory
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.000]   to put out more and more units of these.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.480]   And obviously, whether they're starting to gather the business
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.080]   and they just don't want to produce anymore,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.600]   or they're getting ready to launch a new product
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   and it makes zero cents to produce another run of--
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.920]   because you don't just make one of these, right?
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.680]   You make them on mass.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.520]   That's how they keep their margins.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.960]   It makes zero cents to make a new run of the old 2011
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.280]   Thunderbolt display when new ones will be coming out
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.520]   presumably this fall.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.640]   But if Google wins creeds to the monitor with a GPU
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.920]   that was rumored for WWDC?
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.120]   I don't know if it has a GPU.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.600]   I mean, that's an interesting thing
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.720]   that when I asked about was sort of like, yeah,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.320]   that's an interesting thing.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.880]   I think if Apple did do it, the big question
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.440]   is how would they hit 5K?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.720]   And some people say you can do it
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.800]   with existing Thunderbolt and DisplayPort technology.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.280]   It does support up to 5K at 60 frames per second,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.480]   sorry, 60 Hertz.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.720]   Other people are saying, no, you have to wait till Thunderbolt 3
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.920]   and then Thunderbolt 3 isn't enough
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.040]   because now the new DisplayPort is not coming anymore with--
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.120]   it's not in Skylake.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.320]   It's not coming with KB Lake.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.120]   It's probably not even coming with Canon Lake,
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.600]   which is coming after.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.840]   And it's really a mess.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.120]   Like it is, frankly, Intel and the Thunderbolt spec right now
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.640]   and the DisplayPort spec are a complete and utter mess.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.680]   And what Apple did internally with the iMac,
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.800]   with the 5K iMac is they made their own T-Con,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.720]   a timing controller so they could fuse together two channels
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.200]   internally and hide all the ugliness
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.000]   and just present you with a 5K display.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.880]   And they could perhaps use two cables or make a fused cable
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.680]   with a special connector on it that goes into two ports
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.920]   or do something else or maybe just have a high capacity
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.720]   Thunderbolt port that's Apple specific, at least at first.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.480]   But I think that's not going to slow them down.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.880]   I think if they decide they want to stay in the display business,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.640]   we'll just see that 5K display this fall.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   You can make an argument.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.840]   There's no point in staying in the display business
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.320]   that's become commoditized.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.560]   The prices have been cut so dramatically.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.480]   It's challenging for Apple to charge what it would like
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.080]   to charge for displays.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.520]   And it only has two products, the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro,
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   neither of which are important products for Apple.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.880]   Well, with the MacBooks, initially the big push
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.160]   with the 2011 Thunderbolt display was
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.120]   that they made that one cable that branched into three
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.960]   that made it super easy to plug it into your MacBook Pro.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.080]   And a lot of the advertising was centered around it.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.880]   You have a MacBook for travel, and then you get home,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.240]   you plug it in, and suddenly it's a phone.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.840]   Do you think they find out that people don't do that?
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.680]   I bet they--
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.120]   A very, very small percentage, a single digit percentage
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.200]   of Apple customers use, stand-alone display,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.440]   which is why when people were complaining about the MacBook
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.320]   and then you look at the numbers, it's like, yeah,
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.000]   you can't plug it in.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.160]   I was one of the people who do use it.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.600]   I still have that display in my other room.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.160]   It wasn't a large-scale problem for them.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.240]   People think they want to do it, then they
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.040]   get the laptop home and they go, I'm fine.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.040]   I'm just going to sit on this also.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.640]   I used to think that I needed the 17-inch--
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.520]   I was like, oh, I'm never going to give the 17-inch MacBook.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.000]   And I'm quite fine with the 15.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.080]   Also, Apple's having this really ongoing trend of--
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.080]   it's not like they're ignoring the pro market,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.600]   but I think that they would rather
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.080]   focus on people who don't have such high expectations
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.680]   and needs for a super, super, super precise screen anymore.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.800]   And that was the thing that they would always
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.080]   sell about when they were selling those Thunderbolt
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.000]   monitors.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.040]   It's not just that, hey, look how beautiful the aluminum frame
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.800]   is, but this is one of the most accurate monitors
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.400]   you can possibly get.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.160]   And they are right.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.400]   If you-- people like Alex who do need that sort of clarity,
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.360]   people who are in photo and video markets,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.520]   they have options also.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.600]   They know how to operate those monitors.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.680]   It's just a whole lot of work and a whole lot of pain
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.240]   for not a whole lot of upsize as far as Apple's concerned.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.480]   And as you point out, Renee, it's a smart thing for Apple
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.560]   to put out this release and let people know this,
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.520]   just to get ahead of it.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.440]   Because they're going to find out as soon as they go in the store
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.720]   and they say, no, we're out and we're not making anymore.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.040]   And then you get the rumors.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.560]   And it is interesting because Apple
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.960]   doesn't have to make a Mac Pro anymore.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.440]   They could just totally see that market tie.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.480]   I doubt they sell any Mac Pros at all.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   But even at a low volume, they want it to make it.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.920]   It's almost like-- it's the traditional Lamborghini thing.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.240]   Lamborghini is not owned by itself.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   It's been owned by a mainstream car company for many years.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.480]   But you make the super car.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.320]   You make the hyper car because that introduces future technologies.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.840]   And it makes a statement about who you are as a company.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   And it's still possible that there are people at Apple
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.920]   who will be using the current Mac Pro and the next generation
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.600]   Mac Pro.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.800]   And they don't want a Dell logo or an LG or an Asus logo
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.400]   on their desktop.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.240]   And Apple will make a monitor for those 5%
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.640]   because that, for them at least, is an aspirational 5%.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.640]   I wish-- I really-- I don't understand.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.120]   I have to say this would be a great time for Apple to say,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.960]   we would also like to make the Cheesegrater Mac Pro again.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.440]   Or just the next generation Cheesegrater, whatever that looks like.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.640]   It was such a mistake to make the Mac Pro un-upgradable.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.200]   It was a mistake to make it un-ungradable
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.960]   and then not upgrade it.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.480]   Right.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.360]   And granted, Xeon chips don't come out every day.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:44.800]   But--
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.440]   But GPUs, they're way behind.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.400]   Mark Farmer said this really well the other day,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.720]   that you can update the GPU almost constantly to stay ahead.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.120]   And that would give you a refresh cycle.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.880]   And granted, it's probably not practical to do it all the time.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.680]   But at least the market--
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.760]   But the market-- the pros that use these devices would.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.200]   Or would be-- at least that's what they want.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.040]   Right, Alex?
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.160]   Am I wrong?
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.440]   Well, I mean, you can also-- I mean,
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.760]   there's a lot of external peripherals
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.800]   that you can add to the--
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.600]   Oh, but that's a terrible solution.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.440]   It is to some degree, except that it's one of those things
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.480]   that you can-- you don't have a huge beast that has
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.280]   to support cards on your desk.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.400]   So you can have something that's much smaller and more compact.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.760]   But I have to admit that even for us, for heavy GPU,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.040]   we have a couple of machines here that have three GPUs in them,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.120]   three and four GPUs in them.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.600]   And for those, those are all, of course,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.240]   Linux machines from our perspective.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.680]   So we don't really look at the Mac Pro as the heavy duty
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.880]   hardcore computer that we need.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   We use it for the specific things we need,
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.800]   mostly editing, photo editing and video editing,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.600]   and some VR work.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.480]   But outside of that, we primarily
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.760]   focus on the bigger Linux boxes to do most of our hardware.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.480]   I had a call on the radio show on Sunday from a guy
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.400]   who's a video editor.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.160]   He said, my client's more and more demanding 4K.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.360]   I bought a Mac Pro.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.080]   I bought it.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.040]   What if it's 12 core, the biggest, the most cores I could get?
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:16.160]   He probably spent $8,000 on his Mac Pro two years ago.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.640]   He says, there are an upgrade path.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.560]   Well, I don't think--
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.200]   I guess I don't feel like the--
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.760]   I mean, for 4K, we do a fair bit of 4K work.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.800]   And I don't-- our Mac Pro's definitely can edit those.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.640]   That's what I told him.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.680]   He said, yeah, but the frame rate isn't great.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.480]   I'm not thrilled about it.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.640]   Well, I guess the question I guess I have is,
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.520]   A, what is he trying to do with it?
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.000]   And B, maybe we're doing something simpler.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.400]   We do a fair number of layers.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.360]   But for us, the real limiter is drive speed.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.440]   So it's not typically the computer itself.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.400]   You can get external GPUs for the Mac Pro and the Thunderbolt.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.800]   But it's only Thunderbolt 2.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.960]   So I can't imagine that that's going
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.000]   to be as good as putting an internal GPU.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.120]   A 30-year-old machine, Leo.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.920]   But I think that drive speed becomes very important
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.040]   in those environments, as well as really thinking
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.440]   about what you're looking at and when
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.480]   you need to look at it that way.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.440]   I mean, you need to remember that Star Wars--
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.000]   the Star Wars that I worked on, episode one,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.920]   was all edited in AVR six.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.400]   I know.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.320]   So I mean, everybody has to see every pixel when they're
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:21.920]   cutting the edit.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.760]   You're like, OK, well, you don't really
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.520]   need to see all of that.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.240]   So I understand the need for that.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.160]   At some point, I've got to be able to render out
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.320]   something and take a look at it and make sure that it's right.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.600]   But there's a whole lot of infrastructure
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.960]   that you're adding that is questionable as to whether that
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.320]   really makes you cut faster than just having--
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.960]   But even the internal SSD on the Mac Pro
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.880]   is now ancient technology compared
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.840]   to what you're getting on an iMac, for instance.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.720]   But we don't use any internal--
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.760]   we don't use the internal drive for any computer
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.560]   that we have to do any work.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.160]   Right.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.680]   It holds the applications.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.800]   And it holds some basic communication stuff, everything
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.080]   else.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.360]   But when we're doing real work, we want to--
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.760]   But you're limited them by the Thunderbolt 2 throughput,
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.800]   which is fast enough, I guess.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.240]   Or ethernet, I guess.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.960]   Maybe when we get to 6K, 8K, which we're not at right now,
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.440]   those things will become much more of an issue.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.520]   But 4K still is going to be good for the next 4 times.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.480]   So you can limp along.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.040]   The question really is, where is Apple?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.320]   Where is Apple's hard on this?
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.920]   I think this is the last one.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.080]   I mean, I think that I don't have any--
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.680]   I think that the Mac Pro is probably--
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.440]   they may do one rev to it.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.800]   But I think they decided to go all out and build
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.120]   this last design.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.880]   But the cheese graters lasted for a long time.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.520]   And I don't see any reason why Apple is going to--
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.720]   when you look at how effective and how powerful the iMacs are,
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.560]   we have a couple--
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.600]   we play three or four of the Mac Pros.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.280]   And everything else we get are Mac.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.320]   Well, we have a lot of laptops and Mac minis.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:58.280]   But for work, the iMacs are plenty for almost everything
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.320]   you'd want to do.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.240]   So I don't know if the Mac Pro makes sense.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.800]   I don't think they're going to make another one.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.680]   It still feels like the few people make up on it's a one more--
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.440]   So if they don't make a Mac Pro, then the external display
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.800]   seems almost really not important.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.560]   It does feel though that if you make that Mac Pro,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.000]   it's sort of incumbent on you to upgrade it for the people
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.800]   who do want that to help.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.000]   No, I think that they should upgrade it.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.760]   I think that a component--
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.640]   They have it.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.080]   I wouldn't be surprised in the next year
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.840]   if we saw some kind of component upgrade where we--
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.000]   there are bits and pieces of it.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.160]   A new version that has it.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.360]   I don't know if they're going to--
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.760]   Actually, I think that they promoted
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.800]   that you could upgrade components of those things.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.520]   But I could see them revving it.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.800]   But I don't think that we're going
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.920]   to see another form factor from Apple ever.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.400]   I think they designed the Mac Pro to be a Mac Mini plus,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.720]   really.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   It's the ultimate expression of the Mac Mini.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.400]   I don't mean that as a way to denigrate that product.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.480]   But if they really wanted to assess
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.280]   the needs of the power users who are turning CPU horsepower
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.680]   into money with every day of their lives,
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.320]   I don't think that's the sort of thing that would have made.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.080]   I like Renee's comparison to the Lamborghini.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.040]   I would probably compare it to a Ford GT,
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.000]   because Lamborghini they'll make 300--
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.880]   they'll make what?
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.240]   400 or 1,000 copies of a car and they'll sell them
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.760]   for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.640]   I think Ford will make--
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.960]   Ford has the Ford GT, which is the aspirational model.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.320]   It shows that, hey, look what we can do that has the Ford name
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.080]   played on it.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.000]   And as Renee says, it's technologies
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   we can try out at a smaller scale
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.320]   and then introduce into other models as we go along.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.800]   And these are all really nice things.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.320]   And also the idea of having a really beautiful object
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.840]   as a computer, that's also a really fine goal.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.920]   But there are so many goals that go into the design
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   of any computer.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.080]   And I just don't think that making pro-level users--
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.520]   again, non-consumer grade users happy--
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.480]   is really what moves Apple these days.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.840]   And again, that's not meant as a slam of any kind.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.160]   You have to decide what moves you as a creative person.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.920]   And for Apple, it really is consumer level sort of technology.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.720]   They abandon the server market.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.440]   I don't see any reason why they might not abandon it.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.480]   They abandon the server market.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.360]   They're dropping pro apps left and right.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.440]   Who knows when Final Cut X is going to be killed.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.040]   They pretty much abandon all the other consumer--
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.560]   even consumer desktop apps.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.240]   So I think they tell us-- Apple always-- for years,
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.600]   they've been telling a story about themselves
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.360]   through the devices and the stuff that they release.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.760]   And this is the next book, not just the next chapter.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.600]   That says that we thank you, thank you, professional designers
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.640]   for helping us to get through the 1990s
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.080]   and getting us back on our feet.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.760]   Good luck to you.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.640]   We love you.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.640]   Enjoy the videos.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.160]   Enjoy something.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:40.660]   Thank you.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.560]   Thank you.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.640]   And I think that Final Cut probably
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.000]   is going to be around for quite some time.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.360]   And I think partially because I think
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.480]   it really fits into the educational market
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.120]   and some of the corporate markets
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.240]   that they're interested in.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.320]   So I don't think that they're that interested in--
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.080]   we're seeing more and more films now being cut on Final Cut X
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.240]   as they continue to add the features in there.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.000]   Well, focus was the first one.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.560]   And there's another one.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:00.920]   It's coming back.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.680]   In other words--
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.280]   Well, there's a secret NDA show off of the new version
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.920]   a few months ago that we're still waiting on.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.960]   I didn't go to that.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.400]   I was actually working.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.620]   So I didn't say anything I want because I didn't see anything.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.380]   All I saw was big, wide eyes of, oh my gosh,
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.660]   I just saw the sun.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.660]   So there's a lot of people that are very excited about it.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.580]   I don't actually know what was in that infamous movie.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.700]   You've got to be careful, though.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.500]   And I'm sure the reason they're doing things like that
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.740]   is because it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.060]   that pros look at Apple and say, well,
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.260]   I don't have any confidence in the future of pros.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.500]   And so we'll abandon it.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.140]   And then Apple says, see, pros don't want to use this anyway.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.220]   And it just--
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.460]   So you've got to be very careful.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.620]   I think that makes sense that they would do this kind
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.660]   of super secret beta show just to say, look, no, no, no.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.140]   We really want to keep doing this.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.560]   Well, and I think that the advantage
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.700]   that Final Cut still has over Abbott and Premiere
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.940]   is that the code base is much younger.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.020]   They rewrote everything.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.700]   And so their ability to scale and scale quickly
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.980]   with hardware and everything else
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.460]   is probably much more developed than--
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.220]   and it'll be very hard to be Premiere or Abbott
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.460]   would have to rewrite their software to do that.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.380]   So they were able to take advantage of a lot of this
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.460]   in the short term, whether they can take advantage of it
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.540]   in the long term is unknown.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.860]   But the reality is that the market, the corporate market,
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.140]   the education market is probably 10 times
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.860]   the size of the film market and TV market.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.540]   As video becomes something that everybody's
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.820]   doing all the time, whether it's the Khan Academy
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.060]   or all these other things, video is
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.140]   an integral part of the future of education
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.820]   and corporate communication and corporate education.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:44.980]   It is half of it, if not more of what
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.540]   these corporations are working on.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.020]   And so I think people just don't really
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.420]   grok the massive divisions in these companies
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.580]   of all the major companies we talk about that
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.140]   have entire studios.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.380]   They have entire staffs.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.540]   And all they're doing is producing video all day, every day.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.940]   They're producing it for their internal employees.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.220]   They're producing it for their consumers.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.700]   They're producing it for marketing.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.940]   And so that market is massive.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.980]   And it doesn't mean that Apple--
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.260]   And are they still using Macs?
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.300]   Some of them aren't.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:14.820]   Some of them aren't.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.700]   It really depends on what they're doing.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.660]   But the ones that are making the decision
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.180]   from a corporate perspective of that's $300 a copy,
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.580]   it's really hard to argue, especially for a penny
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.940]   pinching company.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.020]   I'm going to spend $300.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.100]   And I've never seen an upgrade cost.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.020]   Or I'm going to spend $50 a month, or $40 a month,
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.660]   or whatever to have premiere.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.500]   That's hard.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.420]   It's hard to get past the CFO.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.700]   And so whether it's a school, or--
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.820]   because it's much easier for a lot of these corporations
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.780]   to not have a monthly bill, but have a one-time bill
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.820]   for their group that they never really have to upgrade.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.260]   But I think they could also make the opposite statement,
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.780]   which is, well, we could see Adobe's
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.060]   going to continue in this business,
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.140]   they're going to maintain it.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.100]   Let's do what we did here, which
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.900]   is a ban in the Macintosh platform,
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.780]   and move to premiere and Windows PCs.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.980]   Well, and I think that also--
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   but if you look at that--
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.580]   Because that looks like that has a future.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.580]   Right.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.620]   I mean, here's Cloudy from Apple.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.660]   You could make the case that they're not out of this business.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.660]   And I think that's a good case.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.500]   But it is a little cloudy.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.940]   It is-- I think the other thing, though,
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.340]   is that we all look at--
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.180]   a lot of us have to change applications a lot.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:23.180]   So you make the decision about how you're going to go forward.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.100]   Is there a hackintosh market for this?
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.140]   Do you really want to be high-end hardware?
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.740]   I know there's a fairly brisk aftermarket for cheese
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.340]   and a lot of the recruiter max in flashed video cards and things.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.300]   You can get the latest video cards in that thing.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.620]   Yeah, I think that most people who use Final Cut 10
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.100]   just are committed to doing that.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.220]   I mean, it's a 99%.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.260]   So there might be some kind of hackintosh market for it.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.220]   But I don't think that--
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.340]   I would hate to base a business on a hackintosh.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:48.820]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.140]   And I think that when you look at the cost of labor
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.300]   against doing most of the editing, most of the things
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:58.300]   that we do, the cost of a Mac Pro is not--
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.820]   and most of my editing is all done on a Mac book Pro.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.460]   I mean, I use Final Cut probably every day on my Mac book Pro.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.980]   And so I don't have any--
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.420]   and I don't feel like I need to hook it
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.820]   to anything bigger for what I do anyway.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.180]   And so it's one of those things that I think that--
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.220]   I don't think Apple's going to go away from Final Cut.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.620]   I think that they're going to continue to invest in it.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.700]   They make-- they have a very, very, very large installed
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.100]   base for Final Cut 10.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.100]   It was fun.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.700]   And somebody in the chatroom--
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.980]   actually, nobody in the chatroom is saying--
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:34.020]   being burned by Adobe is a lot of the reasons people use Final Cut.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.260]   It goes both ways, doesn't it?
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.060]   And so I think that the numbers that I've seen
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.580]   is that while the professional market will talk about moving
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.500]   to Avid or Premiere, the largest installed base
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.740]   is still-- the largest installed base is a Vai movie,
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.060]   of course, because it's free.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.500]   And the second largest installed base is Final Cut 10.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.380]   And so it may not have the--
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.460]   because the professional market is very tiny compared
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.300]   to the overall number of people editing.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:00.780]   And so--
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.700]   But they buy expensive hardware.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.020]   Yes.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.900]   Sorry?
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.820]   They buy expensive hardware.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.060]   I mean, well, I mean--
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.420]   I don't know.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.940]   Is it not an important market for a company as big as Apple?
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.980]   Is it not matters?
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.380]   Well, I think, again, I think it matters--
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.660]   Not much as Apple's.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.540]   Apple is very interested in--
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.380]   I think that Apple is very interested in the education
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:19.700]   market.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.540]   They're very interested in the corporate communications
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   market.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:29.500]   And I think that Final Cut 10 gives them a tool that fits in
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.900]   with a lot of their other tools.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.660]   And for that strategic reason, I don't think
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.300]   that it's going to go away anytime soon.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.100]   Which is more important-- software hardware to the pro?
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   I'd say probably software.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.300]   I mean, I think that the hardware has become largely--
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.780]   I mean, unless you're really on a very outer edge,
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.380]   the hardware is largely commoditized.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.020]   I mean, you know, anything--
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   and again, I've been spending the same amount of money
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:00.340]   on Office of Hardware for 20 years, so about $10,000.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.100]   So there's a $10,000 version of everything.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.780]   In the late '90s, that was a SGI octane, right?
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.460]   Or actually, O2, which is the little octane.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.900]   But I had it at the house.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.860]   And so the octanes were what we got to use at work.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.540]   And so anyway, but the-- so there's
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.740]   been kind of this for professional--
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.700]   because again, when you're talking about paying a professional
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.500]   $85,000 or $150,000 a year, the cost of the computer,
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.980]   what you don't want is down here.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.180]   So spending $10,000 or $15,000 on a part.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.060]   Well, that's my point.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.060]   It's not about price.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   It's about confidence in the company, quality of software,
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   quality of hardware.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.340]   And you're saying it doesn't matter
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.540]   if they don't update the hardware.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.820]   At some point, it does, though, right?
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:46.900]   Because it does eventually.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.860]   I mean, I think that they definitely
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.060]   have to upgrade it occasionally to do that.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.900]   But a lot of us have used that--
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.500]   we use the cheese graters for a long time.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.420]   I got a great deal.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.420]   Any people still are.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.140]   And so we kept them going for quite some time.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.020]   And again, it did need to eventually.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.580]   I mean, it eventually became a limit
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.300]   to where those are going to go.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:11.340]   But I think that so far, definitely, I buy computers
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.420]   that are much more powerful than my Mac,
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.700]   whether it's the R encoders that I have one encoder that's
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.300]   got like six GPUs and 80 CPUs or something like that,
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.380]   or CPU cores or whatever.
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.900]   And so we buy those as well.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.380]   But--
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.060]   To be fair, the reason we abandoned Apple wasn't any--
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.940]   wasn't like that.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.460]   This-- all of this, the new Final Cut
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.180]   didn't support the storage area network,
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.100]   San we were using.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.380]   And so it was a show stopper.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:39.860]   I mean--
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.700]   And when it came out--
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.420]   And it does now.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:41.940]   By the way.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.420]   It does now, right?
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.080]   And Apple was very conservative when they started.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:46.720]   They brought it.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.560]   They pulled it back.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.920]   And they didn't have a lot of features
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.560]   that a lot of us expected.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.480]   And then they've added most of those back in.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.680]   And now I think what we're seeing
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.040]   is they're in the process of adding a lot of other things
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.280]   to it beyond what we originally thought we needed.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.920]   And so I think that there's a lot of--
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.600]   I think there's a long way for it to grow.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.120]   I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.960]   OK, good.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.600]   And the Pro Market also includes developers.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.920]   And that's very important for Apple.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.420]   Absolutely.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.420]   And they use multiple monitors in a variety of displays.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.700]   Although I think they like the bigger displays
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.380]   than Apple's 27-inch.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.340]   So--
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.940]   Well, a lot of the programmers that we work with really
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.900]   like two displays.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.420]   Those guys are just beans for--
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   You need real estate.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.220]   And you need high res, right.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.220]   And size.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:33.720]   No.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.820]   They keep on going.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.820]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.860]   And when you see these 34-inch monitors now
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.420]   in commonplace monitors--
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.140]   and lost in half the price of the Apple Thunderbolt--
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.140]   you can see why Apple's maybe just saying, I could--
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:46.640]   I don't know.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   What do you think, Renee?
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.900]   You think this is abandoning the market?
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.940]   Or you think it's clearing it out for the upgrade in the fall?
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.140]   It's so hard because this could really go either way.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.860]   And clearing the deck obviously gives them both those choices.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.300]   I think Apple is a company though.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.100]   They still believe.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.140]   It's sort of like they believe they have to do music.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.900]   And I think there's a component within that company
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.340]   that just loves the Mac and if they can produce enough of them.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.540]   And people will pay a premium.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.660]   I mean, it's well established.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.460]   People are still buying those Thunderbolt displays,
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.580]   even though they're five years old and their sticker
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.660]   price is no reflection of what market would dictate.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.540]   So there are people who would buy them.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.300]   And if Apple could make one, especially
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.060]   they could do something like a really good quality 5K display
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.860]   and push us forward again, especially if it
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.660]   had things like DCI-P3 color, like wide color gamut
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.860]   and other things that they can do at Apple scale,
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.820]   that suddenly the Dell's and the ASUSs will rush to embrace.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.100]   I think it is aspirational and I hope Apple really does
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:39.940]   continue to do it.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.620]   Well, and that's also one thing we didn't really address
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.460]   is quality of the monitors.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.300]   And I know historically for a long time people said, well,
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.380]   Apple monitors are more expensive,
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.140]   but the color gamut's wider, the accuracy is much better.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.140]   Is that still true or is that--
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.660]   They individually color calibrate a lot of their stuff.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.340]   And I don't know if True Tone would work on an Apple display.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.820]   That's sort of technology I'd be super interested in seeing.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.660]   Even if you could turn it off, but just in some ways--
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.700]   Right, having that.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.140]   And it's not blue, it's not yellow.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.940]   It's actually matching what your ambient room is.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.820]   Some people are speculating, oh, this is just
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.740]   because Apple's going to do a television set in the fall.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.620]   That's crazy talking.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.260]   Dave, as far as I know, that project is still up on cinder
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.340]   blocks in the Apple parking lot.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.020]   They drained the oil.
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.540]   But to that point, there are a lot of lines in HPA,
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.220]   so some of the other makers, where
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.980]   you can buy the normal version of a certain monitor for X
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:32.420]   dollars, but for an extra 75, it will include a piece of paper
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.380]   that says that this has been specifically calibrated.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.420]   Here's the report.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.620]   And if you're big shop, of course,
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.060]   you calibrate them yourself anyway.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.060]   Exactly.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.100]   And I think it's an interesting conversation.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.300]   It really speaks to the soul of Apple,
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.900]   and not so much about any individual product.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.020]   That's of less interest than, well, what does Apple see
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.820]   itself as, and where does it see itself going?
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.060]   And it's also cool because sometimes it
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.380]   could be just about anything.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.900]   But also, oftentimes, Apple realizes
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.020]   that we're the only company that can do this right now,
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.700]   because we're the only people who thinks that this is important
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.900]   today, and we're the only people who can spin up manufacturing
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.940]   on an item like this.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.380]   So they will manufacture screens to that specification
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.300]   and sell package and sell them that way.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.820]   And then a couple years later, or five years later,
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.700]   everyone else in the industry catches up.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.980]   And now there's really no need for them to make this anymore,
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.620]   because now it's one of seven or eight or nine.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:29.620]   And it doesn't fascinate them the way that a new watch will.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:34.340]   So, all right, you said something interesting to me, Alex.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:38.140]   I just want to-- I don't want to make this a Linux conversation,
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.620]   but you said you're using Linux boxes?
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.940]   Well, yeah, we use Linux boxes.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.860]   So all of our encoder and all of our encoding--
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.740]   It's for specific purposes.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.020]   Well, yes, they're very specific.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.180]   So the Linux boxes that we're--
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.340]   So you're not ending video with Linux boxes.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.100]   No, no.
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.100]   No.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.540]   We've got probably, I don't know, 18 or 20--
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.540]   So it's sort of like server stuff.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.340]   It's a code.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.820]   And then when we stitch, we now have live stitches for the OZO,
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:06.260]   which are all kind of built specifically to spec.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.260]   So those are the kind of things we're doing.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.900]   The day has not come when somebody can build a Linux box
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.860]   and do the final cut style editing and add effects.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.820]   And there's people who have-- there's edge cases.
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.660]   There's stuff out there.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.180]   I keep trying--
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.460]   Image editing and everything else, but no one's taking much.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.660]   I mean, there are guys that use it,
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.980]   and there's big firms that have really built a lot into that
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.820]   because they can customize it and make it all those things.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:29.260]   But that's a real edge case, in my opinion.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:33.220]   I've been trying dark table as a lightroom solution--
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.020]   or alternative.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.500]   It does do raw.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.220]   It does do a lot of the stuff lightroom does on Linux.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.460]   Or it has to get to a point to go to Linux.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.700]   It can't just be-- it does most of what it does on Linux.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.100]   Yeah, no, no, I understand.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.060]   Like, it has to be like, I'm going to now do something better.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:46.500]   No, I'm a hobbyist.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.420]   So I can do stuff like this, yeah.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:48.820]   Right, yeah.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.780]   But for me, it's just like, when I turn it on,
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.780]   I just have to work.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.260]   I got like 10 minutes to do this,
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.940]   and I needed to get done quickly.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.740]   And for me, my pipeline between Compressor and Final Cut
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.540]   and everything else is a very well-known pipeline.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.060]   And I'm not, I think, pretty, pretty tied into it.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:12.140]   I'm very intrigued by a switching program called--
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.980]   what's it called?
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.540]   It's not OpenShot.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.540]   There's a new switching kind of TriCaster style
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.740]   switching program for Linux.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.940]   I'm kind of intrigued by it.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.620]   But I can't make our staff build a Linux box.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.940]   I'm going to start using Linux.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:25.380]   I can't.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.900]   I would like to, but I can't.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.940]   But I was thinking, if you were a small podcaster starting up
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.500]   with video and you wanted to kind of really go
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.140]   the open source route, there are-- it's interesting.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.140]   I've been interesting.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.940]   There's tools out there.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.740]   I mean, I think that for me, always, we look at stability.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.020]   For us, we look at stability and how many man hours
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:46.220]   I'm going to put into something to build that out.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.140]   And so we prefer low level--
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.940]   and we're not low level, but fairly low level,
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.300]   hardware to do most of our work.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.220]   We don't want Windows or Linux or Apple or anything else
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.700]   to be tied in between our video signals.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.460]   And also, you end up spending a lot of time.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.180]   And if you're hobbyist and you have the time
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.300]   when you're getting started and you have more time than money,
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.820]   then that's always the decision you make
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.420]   is to go ahead and fiddle with it.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:10.940]   But I've watched a lot of people who have asked me
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.140]   for advice around podcasting and watch them just go down
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.180]   this path of they're going to build all this stuff themselves
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.300]   and they're going to do all this--
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.580]   Yeah, that's crazy talk.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:21.620]   So much time and money ends up getting invested
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.260]   in something that kind of works.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.420]   But if you would get a chance, look at Open Broadcaster software.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.740]   This is the one-- thank you.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.340]   OB.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.260]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:35.340]   Yeah, we have played a little bit with it.
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.020]   I think it's got a pretty good activation for Facebook Live
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.100]   or people have been playing with it for that.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.500]   And it's free.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.220]   And it's free.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.700]   And yeah, it works.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.020]   It doesn't work in my pipeline because we administer
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.620]   our elementals from all over the world.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.500]   So we don't really--
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.900]   No, that's why I think it'll be for somebody small who's--
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.660]   No, I think it's great.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.540]   For someone small who's putting something together,
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.380]   it's very flexible.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.260]   And you can-- it's definitely producing a relatively good--
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.100]   I believe if I'm correct it's FFM-based.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:04.620]   It is.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.100]   Yeah, I think it's almost a front end for it, right?
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.180]   So I think that-- and that's an industry standard way
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:11.780]   to do that.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:15.180]   So I think it's a great one to look at if you're doing stuff
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:15.700]   on your own.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.700]   [CHUCKLES]
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.820]   But there's also, again, like you can take a--
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.100]   I mean, for nowadays, if you want a stream to Facebook
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.980]   or to a Facebook live or YouTube or whatever,
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.340]   you can get a tarradec for--
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:28.820]   Right.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.740]   But if you're a Twitch streamer and you're doing--
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.900]   let's play videos.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.500]   Apparently, a lot of Twitch streams you're using OBS Studio.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.580]   It makes sense.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.820]   There's this whole cottage industry now
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.420]   of it's like one person in his living room.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.220]   And he's making a good living.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.020]   And he's basically got a broadcast studio in his living room.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.340]   And my son watches those.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.340]   Minecraft videos.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.260]   He's going to watch more and more and more.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.420]   This is the future.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.500]   That's the future.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.500]   This is the future.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.380]   I feel like I'm finally become an old man,
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.500]   because I have no idea what you're doing there.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.220]   I mean, I don't understand why you were watching Minecraft
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.660]   for four hours.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.300]   We just got-- we just got--
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.140]   I just got my kids.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.300]   They're like educational iPads.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.660]   And because we're going to do a lot of the Swift Playground
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.180]   stuff.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.980]   And so they got to make lists of all things
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.780]   they want to put on them.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.500]   But the one thing I said, no games, no Minecraft.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.380]   No, you have other iPads.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.580]   You know, my old iPads.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.860]   You can still use those.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.300]   Chad Johnson.
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.140]   I didn't know that.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:28.980]   He's using this for the OBS studio for the Giz Wiz podcast.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.300]   I feel like we're in a new world.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.060]   And you remember Alex Bennett.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.700]   I know Alex Lindsey.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.860]   There is a San Francisco radio broadcaster, Alex Bennett,
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.980]   who was kind of a poor man's Howard Stern.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.380]   He kept getting fired.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:46.500]   And he finally just decided to do a show with an Amiga out
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.220]   of his kitchen.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.380]   And he was using the video toaster
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.580]   and doing a show out of his kitchen.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:57.220]   And this was almost 20 years ago.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.620]   And I'm thinking, that's interesting.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.140]   And here we are now.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.380]   I think that's in our future.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.900]   And I wouldn't be surprised if the next Johnny Carson or Jimmy
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.060]   Fallon or somebody, some guy in his kitchen.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.780]   Well, I mean, one thing I will say is that--
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:11.580]   Really?
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.140]   With a little bit of investment, with a little bit of investment,
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:19.260]   you can definitely build a broadcast, even 4K streaming
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.340]   solution out of your house.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.380]   It doesn't take that much anymore.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.380]   I mean, it is--
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.260]   That's amazing.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.140]   Amazing.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.140]   I mean, I look at the fact that I've--
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.700]   because a lot of our stuff is now all 4K, 4K, 4K.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.660]   At least how we build our systems.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:38.940]   And I'm just dumbfounded by how little I'm spending.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.380]   I mean, I'm supposed to spend a lot of money,
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.340]   but I don't know how little I'm spending now.
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:44.900]   And you get these little black magic mini--
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:45.580]   what are they?
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:50.500]   Micro cameras, the micro studio cameras.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.380]   And they're like tiny.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.860]   And they're $1,200 each, 4K.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.780]   Is Tom Green still doing his thing in his basement?
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.460]   Remember he built bleachers in his basement?
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.900]   He was doing a whole show.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.940]   Is that how you're thinking of Andy?
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:07.500]   No, no, but that's actually entirely the wrong way.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.980]   If thinking about building a tonight show set--
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   like, cravering.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.180]   That's kind of what he did.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.540]   But exactly.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.740]   I think it's more like people who didn't really
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.460]   grow up with Carson just thinking
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.060]   that I don't have to build a set.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.980]   I can just hold up a phone like this.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.460]   And so long-- the star of the show
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.140]   was in the technology in the set.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.980]   Really is my personality.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.420]   And giving an experience to people
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.100]   that they feel they can connect to.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.540]   And so that's why I think that what makes you feel old
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:40.060]   to Alex's point isn't so much that as the understanding
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.380]   that there are people who have 15 million YouTube followers
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.340]   that I've never heard of.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.780]   There are people who have 20 million Twitter followers
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.540]   that I've never heard of.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.220]   I know.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:48.740]   I know.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:53.660]   And it's not because of being famous
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.900]   used to be about being on one of the three networks.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.780]   And whatever you said the night before
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.940]   is what everybody's talking about the next day.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.300]   Now it really is about finding your tribe
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.820]   and building your tribe around you.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.580]   I was talking to somebody the other day.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:15.940]   And for some reason, Neil Gaiman came up.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:20.780]   And to us, no more famous author in the world.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.540]   He's the guy who he does a signing.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.860]   And he will be there for three hours
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.780]   after the signing was supposed to end
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:29.340]   because there's too many thousands of people in line.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.940]   And he's determined to sign for all of them.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.940]   That's how big he is.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.060]   And yet this person, who is only about 10 years old
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.220]   of the meet, didn't know who he was.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.620]   So there's a difference between what celebrity is today
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:41.580]   and what it was before.
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.940]   And people can now make an excellent living
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.180]   while still being able to go food shopping
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:50.100]   and not being bothered, maybe not being bothered by many people
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.940]   unless your kids are with you.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.420]   Let's take a break.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.420]   Come back with more Andy and Ico Chicago Sun
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.980]   times from imore.com Renee Richie, Alex Lindsey
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.140]   from the Pixel Core.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.220]   And the best thing to do with Alex
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:09.020]   is follow him on Twitter @alexliand say
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:09.740]   because you never know.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:11.540]   He'll just like say things on Twitter like,
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.860]   "Oh, in an hour I'm gonna do a final cut."
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.340]   So just now, okay.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:17.500]   Where can I get him better?
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.060]   By this fall we finally are--
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:19.900]   No, that's better.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:20.740]   That's the way to do it.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.940]   But yeah, but it's dead.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.660]   Why should you do anything better?
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.020]   I mean, different.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.860]   That's old school.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.700]   This is exciting.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.340]   Welcome to the VidCon era.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.500]   Yep.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.300]   Must follow.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.580]   Must follow.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.540]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.540]   Here's another example of an industry
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.060]   that was kind of still in the 19th century
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:40.940]   until very recently.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.060]   In fact, it is with most mortgage brokers.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.940]   Rocket Mortgage is taking it into the 21st century
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:49.660]   with a fast, easy way to get a mortgage or a refi.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:53.860]   And here's the part I love completely on line.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.260]   It comes from quick and low.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.060]   And so you know, these guys really know what they're doing.
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.540]   They're a great provider.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.020]   But they've decided, look, we're gonna take
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.460]   all the complicated time consuming parts
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.140]   of applying for a mortgage out of the equation.
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.580]   You're not gonna have to, you know, they say,
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.700]   okay, I need your pay stubs for four way,
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.140]   every month, and then you can do it all online.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.260]   You can share your bank statements,
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.540]   your pay stubs at the touch of a button.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.260]   Helping you get approved in minutes for a solution
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.180]   that can be customized, can be tailored to you
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.700]   in ways you couldn't do it before.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:27.180]   Thanks to computers and science.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.140]   With Rocket Mortgage, you can not only do it at your desk.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.900]   You could do it on your phone or tablet.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.180]   Yes, it works on mobile as well.
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.980]   Now we're talking.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.140]   Quick online process, you can mention the convenience
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:38.980]   of your couch.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.220]   We were doing Windows Weekly the other day.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.780]   And one of our, I can remember who it was,
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.540]   one of our guests said, oh yeah, he didn't even know.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.260]   He said, oh yeah, just do that.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.140]   It was amazing.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.540]   If you're looking to refinance your mortgage,
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.420]   if you're looking to buy a home,
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.660]   check out Rocket Mortgage today.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.580]   And if you're home shopping,
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.100]   I know a lot of people do that round this time of year,
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.420]   get pre-qualified through Rocket Mortgage.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.260]   And when you go to that house, that open house,
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.500]   you look bright and shiny to the sellers.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.540]   They like that.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.940]   No, no, we're already qualified.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.220]   We can get the loan.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.060]   They like that.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.620]   Quickenloans.com/macbreak.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.740]   Of course, in an equal housing,
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.820]   linear license in all 50 states,
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.620]   and MLS consumeraccess.org number 3030.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.420]   Rocket Mortgage from Quickenloans.
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.700]   Go to quickenloans.com/macbreak.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.820]   We thank Rocket Mortgage by Quickenloans
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.580]   for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.620]   I love doing ads for companies that are saying,
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.740]   we're not gonna do it that dumb way.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.140]   We're gonna do it the modern way.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.260]   The modern way.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.140]   Now, sometimes you could be too modern as an example.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.260]   Now, and I acknowledge it's a rumor,
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:44.220]   but the rumor is Apple will take the headphone jack out of
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.020]   the iPhone, the next iPhone.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:46.860]   What?
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.180]   Leo, what?
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.380]   Okay, this rumor's been around for a while,
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   but as we get closer and closer--
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.700]   I've been watching it, it's not so for a car.
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.060]   As we get closer and closer,
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.420]   I think it gets more and more credible.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.700]   And also, to add to the credibility,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:59.060]   Motorola just did that with their Moto Z.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.820]   There's no headphone jack.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.500]   I had a bunch of HTC phones that didn't have
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.060]   headset jack for years.
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:03.900]   Really?
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.580]   What?
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.300]   They had this little dongle you put on the bottom of the USB.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.620]   I think there were Windows mobile phones,
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.060]   but there might have been a couple others.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.540]   And you'd put this little USB dongle,
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.940]   it was a breakout and it would go to
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.420]   like a headphone jack and then a charger and other stuff.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.180]   Neilai Patel writing in the Verge,
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.060]   taking the headphone jack off phones is user hostile
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.100]   and stupid, have some dignity, he says.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.660]   John Gruber responds during Fireball.net saying,
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.780]   "Hey, that's what people said when an Apple took
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.580]   "the flappy disk out of the iMac.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.580]   "This is times are changing."
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.420]   I think the one of the things--
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.260]   I think the one of the things--
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.500]   Every year that takes out the headphone jack.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.660]   So do you think they won't do it?
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.460]   No, I mean, at some point they'll do it.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.780]   Apple tends to make changes and they believe
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.980]   that they can provide a better sort of
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.300]   a technological leap forward.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.020]   So that's why the dock port was a horrible port.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.500]   They had rewired it for Firewire and for Video
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.580]   and for Audio and it had just become unbearable.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.980]   So they switched to lightning and people complained
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.020]   and now we use lightning.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.980]   I mean, the biggest problem with the switch was that
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.780]   Apple utterly failed to have adapters ready for weeks
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.060]   afterwards, which was just incredibly bad,
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.500]   but the change itself ended up moving us forward.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.860]   For the last few years they've been prototyping things
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.180]   without headphone jacks because when you remove the headphone
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.300]   jacks, the internal volume and there's other things
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.380]   that you can do with it.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.340]   And one year, maybe this year they'll ship it
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.700]   and whichever year they ship it, we will be incredibly upset
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.420]   and then three, four, five years from now,
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.020]   we'll probably barely remember that it was a headphone jacks.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.940]   I mean, I know we were upset with the 30-pin to lightning,
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.180]   but does anyone ever want to go back to the 30-pin?
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.300]   I mean, I look at those.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.180]   When I find them laying around my house at some point,
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.780]   I'm looking at like, oh man, that was an really unhappy life
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.420]   compared to these small little connections.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.500]   I think that the hard part for Apple is that you could
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.540]   theoretically try to do it softly,
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.420]   which is that we're going to release all these great products
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:55.300]   that are now using lightning or Bluetooth.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.100]   But the problem is, can you build up enough demand
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.140]   to make it worth making lots of those?
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.140]   If you do it by taking the headset away,
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.060]   if you do it gradually, of course, in a year,
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.500]   we all know that the headset's going to go away,
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.860]   but are people going to get enough sales out of it?
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.860]   So then by taking the headphone away,
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.420]   you kind of force everybody to go down that path.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.340]   And it could have a negative impact on the number of people
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.100]   that upgrade because they just don't want to go down that path.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.580]   I think that's the big new people like me
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.900]   that have invested a lot in headphones
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.780]   might be a little more resistant to upgrading on this round,
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.700]   which could be billions of dollars for Apple.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.020]   Yeah, I mean, I did write something
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.540]   and then decide not to post it
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.420]   because I don't want to respond to a rumor,
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.620]   especially if it's something I'm going to--
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.620]   if I feel the need to say something rather dramatic,
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.500]   I shouldn't say things like that,
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.860]   but things that may or may not actually happen.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.940]   But I did not read "Rube's Peace."
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.220]   I disagree with the headline
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.300]   because I don't think the two situations
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.980]   aren't any way analogous.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.300]   This rumor has been around for such a long time
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.820]   and it's been spiking in the past two or three months.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.020]   And so for the past, at least for the past month,
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.020]   in addition to all the other things
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.540]   that I sort of spy on the people for when I'm in public,
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.980]   I've been sort of trying to add to that list
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.460]   what kind of headphones are they using?
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:18.180]   And I rarely see people on buses, on trains,
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.220]   in public parks, all these other regular public places
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.180]   using Bluetooth headphones to set a wired ones.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.740]   People tend-- the world that I've been observing
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   is one in which people tend to buy cheap $10 to $30
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.060]   wired compact headphones and use that
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.260]   as their daily listening thing.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.420]   So if Apple were to suddenly say,
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.420]   every single iOS running 2016 model iPhone
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.620]   is not gonna have it on a headphone jack,
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.380]   you're gonna have to either buy special headphones
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.020]   or you're gonna have to carry a dongle.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.980]   I think that would be quite premature at this point.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.860]   It's not as though people are moving away
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.060]   from wired headphones so far.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:03.220]   Bluetooth is simply a way of connecting audio to a phone
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.940]   that is useful for some applications
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:09.020]   but not at all attractive in most applications.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.820]   I think it's like when they did it
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.900]   just the new iMac, it wasn't just that they deleted
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.180]   the floppy port, remember that they switched from USB
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:20.620]   to USB, that was a different sort of thing
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.860]   because everything was moving to USB anyway,
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.180]   all the future devices that anybody was gonna buy
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.500]   for any platform, if you wanted to buy a mouse or keyboard,
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.820]   it was gonna be USB.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.620]   That was very consumer positive.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.460]   Also, you switch out, it's not as though
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.660]   you go through lots of keyboards and mouse's.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.620]   You'll probably use the one that comes with the device
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.900]   and if you don't like it, you'll buy a replacement once
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.740]   and that's it.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.340]   It's not like leaving the house,
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.620]   I don't have headphones, thank goodness,
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.340]   I found another set of headphones in my glove box,
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.980]   I'll use those ones instead.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.900]   I just think it's quite premature
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.460]   and if Apple were to introduce
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:00.660]   headphoneless iPhones this fall,
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.580]   I've kind of stuck for an answer as to how they would
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.540]   present this as anything for a look.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.340]   We now have more volume inside the iPhone to work with
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   and look, we have one less component
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.220]   that we have to pay for.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.700]   - No, they're gonna say so that.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:18.060]   The sound is now going to be 20 times better
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.460]   because the DAC is outside of, or something.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.100]   - The real reason is it's an issue.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.980]   We can ignore it when HTC does it,
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.220]   you can ignore it in Moto Z,
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.140]   because there's many, many choices,
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.820]   but only one company makes an iPhone.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.660]   So it changes it for everybody.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.620]   - Yeah, I don't wanna say that people should just
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.540]   ignore it because when you do see something
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:38.860]   in the Wall Street Journal,
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.300]   this is the best time to express your concerns
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.900]   because if Apple, if you say wait,
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.020]   wait until Apple goes up on stage and makes their case,
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.180]   by then that iPhone is done, that's shipping.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.380]   No matter what you say after that,
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.980]   that iPhone is already shipping.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:51.420]   There have been cases where Apple backtracked
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.900]   like with the buttonless iPod shuffle
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.060]   and they went back to buttons,
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.100]   but you had a year of a buttonless.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.740]   - The other thing that worries me is
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.820]   it buys three or four more years for the lightning port.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.580]   It puts off any conceivable shift to type C,
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.100]   the connector, because if you make this change,
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.660]   you're not gonna, next year, get rid of the lightning port.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.060]   - I believe they feel the lightning port
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.940]   is way ahead of the type C connector still,
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.860]   that it's thinner, it's lighter, it does more things,
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.380]   and they have a better control over it.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.820]   - I wouldn't guess that anybody thinks that, but Apple.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.060]   - It's a smaller profile connector still for them.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.980]   USB C is a little bit bigger and they can't
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.140]   re-ify pins if they want.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.540]   - It's a higher profit connector for them.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.940]   - That's true too, but so like you can make it,
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.220]   like Apple could go up on stage and say,
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.580]   "Look, we've done this, but we've also built,
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.380]   "the lightning now has these audio pins,
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.740]   "and it'll do the DAC inside.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.460]   "It'll give you analog out."
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.660]   And there's a little adapter,
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.020]   and they'll probably sell it for 30 bucks,
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.340]   but hopefully they'll put it in the box,
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.060]   and you can go on using your headphones.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.180]   We have lightning ear pods for you,
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.780]   but the biggest concern is people who want to charge
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.980]   while listening, and that happens all the time.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.860]   You were talking about kids watching Minecraft,
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:54.100]   while they sit there.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.140]   There's all sorts of people,
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.300]   but there are all sorts of people who just listen
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.140]   without ear pods.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.380]   I listen to podcasts all the time.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.740]   - I know, and that's not gonna be a good trend.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.460]   I don't wanna see more people walking.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.420]   - They're down the street with their speakers open.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.780]   - Not in public, but if they put two,
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.260]   'cause right now the iPhone,
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.500]   Apple, the music company,
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.700]   has paid pitiful attention to speakers on iPhones
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.540]   over the years.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.980]   They've finally gotten the iPads better
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.220]   with the Echo with the big,
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.140]   - You couldn't. - You couldn't take chambers.
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.580]   - You can't put good speakers on it.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.180]   - No, but you could put two speakers,
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.540]   maybe even more than two speakers,
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.060]   and at least finally have something where if I turn it,
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.180]   it's not coming out one side,
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.100]   and if I put my hand here, it's not coming out at all.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.220]   At least it's coming out at the top,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.500]   or maybe coming out of both sides, finally.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.940]   I mean, there could be improvement there.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:35.300]   - Does it break things like credit card readers
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.780]   and stuff that are designed for the audio?
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.740]   - So where will have a hard time?
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.540]   Yeah, and some scientific equipment.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.580]   - Yeah, there could be a couple of other extended reasons.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.420]   One of which is that,
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.340]   remember that the headphone jack is a way for a developer
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.220]   to add hardware to the iPhone
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.340]   without having to be part of the MFI program.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.620]   There's also maybe a concern that there will be,
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.180]   it will be possible to do some form of DRM
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.060]   through that connector that you can't do
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.820]   through a perfectly analog headphone device.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.380]   There's a question of, well, developers,
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.180]   well, just makers of headphones,
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.380]   be able to still make really cheap headphones
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:14.300]   without having to pay, be burdened by licensing fees.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.140]   There are a lot of questions here.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.980]   I really hope Apple doesn't do it.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.580]   I don't think it's the right time for it.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.300]   I think that it would make me rethink a couple of things
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.100]   about Apple if they did it.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.340]   But unfortunately, this is the time of year, remember,
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:30.900]   that if there's gonna be a case designed
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.140]   for the new iPhone that does not have a headphone jack,
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.820]   we would have expected to have seen samples
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.820]   of this show up somewhere,
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.700]   and we're starting to see purported samples show up.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.220]   So who knows?
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.940]   - It'll be just the one with the better camera
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.300]   that'll have no headphone port.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:49.860]   They're fine guaranteeing the most possible rage
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.700]   from the Apple audience.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.140]   (laughing)
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.540]   - Well, it would create a lot of,
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.380]   doesn't it?
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.220]   Because that's the big thing,
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.540]   what people are really using their phones for the most,
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.180]   as cameras and so.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.700]   - Having a, putting a camera in that had way more light
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.900]   sensitivity or more resolution.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.100]   - What is the rumor on that?
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.260]   - There's all kinds of reasons for that.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.540]   - One of the biggest ones is two cameras,
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:16.180]   either depending on who speculation you believe
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:20.060]   or who source familiar with Apple's plans, you believe.
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.060]   Either two cameras just to have a little bit more
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:26.020]   of a focal length range or one that will be collecting
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.340]   a different kind of data that can be combined
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.620]   with the data from the primary camera.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.300]   Well, one of the, for instance, one that might be,
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.300]   there are a lot of different two cameras technologies.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.900]   One of them is to have a super, super really good
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.820]   low light black and white camera that does nothing,
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.620]   but provide tone information to the color camera.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.060]   So remember that when Apple,
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:46.300]   all of Apple's camera designs are very synthetic in nature.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.580]   This is building an idealized photo
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.700]   from the limited data that it can capture
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.860]   from simply one exposure off of a mobile light sensor.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.020]   Another one is to simply have enough spacing
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.620]   between the two that it can capture some sense
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.700]   of depth information, which would allow it to expose
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.780]   differently for a background than a foreground,
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:09.540]   make decisions about what's more important in this scene.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.820]   They're a lot of the most interesting,
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:15.180]   the most interesting movements in mobile cameras right now
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.420]   are not necessarily better lens, better sensor,
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.940]   but what happens if you add a second sensor,
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.260]   it's completely separate, second sensor to this,
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.540]   to add to the volume of data that's being crunched
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.820]   to make that picture.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.740]   - Well, and also the thing that Samsung has done with theirs,
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.540]   or HTC, I'm sorry, has done with theirs in the past,
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.940]   that second lens allows you to create a pseudo depth of field,
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.500]   you know, where it basically can figure out basically
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.580]   where people are in the scene,
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.260]   and you can decide what you want to focus on
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.740]   after you've taken the photo,
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.460]   kind of a cheap version of Lightroom.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.100]   - I hope that not anywhere in that era.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.420]   - Go ahead. - That works,
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.620]   but there's actually better ways to do that synthetically
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.980]   by doing focus bracketing,
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.660]   and Apple has such the iPhone, even the iPhone 6 CPU
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.380]   is fast enough that it can actually take bracketed focus
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.340]   exposures really, really fast to make that happen,
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.100]   so that would be one way to do that,
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.460]   but there are other ways to do that as well.
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.100]   - I hope we're not reaching a stage of peak smartphone
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.860]   to the point where all the innovations now are
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.820]   just attempts to differentiate, and in many cases,
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.100]   dopey.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.420]   - There is a way, there is a,
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.460]   you can subscribe to the theory that for years,
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.580]   we have built up the smartphone as the platform,
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.500]   and now that the smartphone has been built up enough
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.860]   that we will be using the smartphone as the platform
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.340]   to build up everything that comes next,
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.860]   including all the internet of things, technologies,
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.140]   and VR, and everything else that follows with it.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.820]   We're not necessarily a peak smartphone,
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.180]   but we're past the year of rapid innovation
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.020]   the way we are on this.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.020]   - That's an excellent point.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.380]   I mean, that's clear that,
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.780]   and a lot of credit goes to Apple for,
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.820]   with the creation of the iPhone,
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:48.820]   spearheading the VR movement, spearheading, you know,
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.500]   the IoT movement,
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.020]   all because they went to, you know,
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.500]   mass, mass, mass manufacturer of sensors and of screens
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.820]   and of all the stuff that you needed for these to take off,
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.700]   and it made it possible for them.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:02.980]   I think we are at the point though,
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.060]   where I'm gonna use this as an example,
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.580]   this is the OnePlus 3,
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.460]   which looks a lot like an iPhone,
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.980]   feels a lot like an iPhone,
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.300]   is in every respect, I would say,
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.700]   you know, a speedy, the camera is as good,
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.660]   you know, as good as an iPhone 6S,
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.860]   and it's $400 unlocked out the door,
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.340]   I think that that's the problem,
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.660]   is that you've got to the point now
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.660]   where this is a commodity almost.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.140]   - And they're all rounded rectangles,
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:30.980]   the all- - Yeah, look at it,
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.260]   I mean, it looks just like,
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.940]   it looks like an HTC and an iPhone had a debut.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.180]   - It's like a jocaine-formed smartphone,
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.460]   and like you could make a triangle,
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.420]   like blackberry, oh, the passport is so innovative,
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:40.860]   but like you really wanted a square phone.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.420]   - Right, right.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.020]   - Yeah, it's difficult,
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.380]   I feel the same ways about that phone too.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:51.100]   I don't think the camera is as good as an S7 phone
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.540]   or an iPhone 6S camera,
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.900]   but yeah, I would not have guessed,
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.300]   the speed is there, the fingerprint sensor
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.220]   is just as fast as on the iPhone,
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:03.140]   it scrolls as fast as an iPhone.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.220]   I don't think that Apple will ever decide
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.500]   to try to make less expensive hardware,
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   I think they're really gonna focus on
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.140]   delivering better value at the same price point
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.660]   that they've always done,
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.580]   but I'm very, very keen to see how this is going to complicate
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.860]   Apple's releases in the future,
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.420]   because I think that the biggest thing
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.060]   that is tethering someone to Android,
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.260]   and the biggest thing that is tethering someone
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.300]   to iOS right now is,
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.820]   you're all the apps that I've already paid for.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.540]   And if I can get the same experience mostly on another phone,
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.380]   why would I want to have to rebuy,
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:42.020]   even if it's just $100 or $80,
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.820]   why would I want to rebuy a whole bunch of new apps?
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.500]   - It also explains a lot of the announcements at WWDC,
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.300]   which promote an Apple ecosystem,
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:54.300]   the benefit of having a watch, a phone, and a computer
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.620]   from Apple.
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.820]   - The minute you make price, the most important feature,
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.380]   then no one ever buys on loyalty anymore,
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.180]   because they'll just buy whatever is the cheapest,
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.540]   less expensive or the most economical phone for them,
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.100]   and the brand will go without the wind of Apple.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.180]   - No, it's not quite-- - It's not quite--
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.300]   - It's that if you can get a phone for half the price
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.940]   that's as premium, which I would submit this is.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.740]   - So like your loyalty is not to Huawei or to OnePlus,
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.260]   or it's just an amazing phone that's at a low price,
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.380]   and that's not a market-- - Well, as long as it may--
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.940]   - No, I'm not-- - It meets this standard,
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.940]   and by the way, while I agree with you,
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.860]   Annie, maybe in minor details,
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.860]   not as good as the S7 camera,
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.500]   I would say that for most people,
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.540]   the difference is not, is de minimis,
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.500]   is not gonna make enough of a difference
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.100]   to make it a bad point.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.380]   - I would, I understand that.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.340]   But to Renee's point,
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.660]   I have to say that I don't think that the iPhone
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.260]   is built any better than that $400 phone.
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:48.420]   I don't think that iOS is objectively any better than Android.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.780]   I can't think of any specific service that Apple offers
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:54.140]   that is better than anything else
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:57.300]   that's available on other platforms.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.380]   Again, I'm not a business analyst,
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.820]   so I don't know exactly how that translates
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.180]   into Apple's future for anything,
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.660]   but it concerns me that when I do an inventory
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.460]   of the stuff that I use,
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.500]   it's a really short list of things that I use
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.580]   that have an Apple logo on it,
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.260]   because they are, that I feel as though
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.100]   that's the best product that's been made for this category.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.060]   It's the one, in the case of the iPad,
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:22.580]   in the case of other Apple devices,
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.100]   it's pretty much that it really suits my needs well,
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.740]   and it's as good as anything else.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.060]   I don't feel as though there's anything
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.500]   that sends me running to Apple right now.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.300]   - Except that ecosystem lock-in,
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.100]   and when Apple starts to say,
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.180]   "Look, you really benefit from a homogeneity
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.780]   "of your hardware, that's enough to keep you in the ecosystem."
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.620]   - That's the goal to increase value of the iPhone.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:46.620]   I mean, the thing is that you're buying Apple for a brand,
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.940]   you're not only buying it because you want an iPhone,
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.220]   you're buying it because there's value in Apple's brand,
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.860]   and that brand is very carefully constructed
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.140]   around premium products,
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.220]   and if they ever made price a competitive feature,
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:59.620]   then they would just be one of many who sell based on price,
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.460]   and you will buy whoever is giving you the best deal
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.460]   at that time. - Yeah, that's the end of the world.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.460]   - And that's why they stayed away from it.
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.380]   Every company tries to make money off what they focus on
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.780]   and tries to fragment what everybody else focuses on.
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.220]   It's why WebKit is free because Apple doesn't compete
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.340]   in the browser space, but a free browser
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.420]   keeps them competitive on that space.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.540]   It's why Google's search algorithm is proprietary
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.340]   and not just giving away for free.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:22.620]   And if Apple ever one day had a product
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.100]   that was so valuable that they thought
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.500]   that giving away iPhones would increase the value
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.060]   of that product, we'd probably see very cheap
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.860]   or free iPhones given away,
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.100]   the way you get a free pair of earbuds
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.740]   in an iPhone box today.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.620]   It's just a question of how the company believes
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:36.780]   it can make money going forward.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.620]   - Well, and just staying back because OnePlus
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:43.780]   is just one of like probably five Chinese companies
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.460]   that are about to march in the States.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.860]   - Yeah, maybe a crazy year.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.660]   - Mark it, yeah.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.980]   - It just bothers me that a few years ago,
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.220]   let's say you have a hypothetical person
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:54.820]   who's still using a candy bar phone
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.660]   and they want to buy their first nice smartphone.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:01.340]   I would have said, well, there's some nice things about Android,
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.340]   but really if you want the best phone made,
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.660]   it is definitely an Apple iPhone.
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:09.660]   Now it's, if you don't already have a money investment
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:14.620]   in locked in contacts, locked in content
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:19.620]   and locked in apps, maybe you want to spend the $200 less
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:23.380]   and buy like good headphones, buy a good charger,
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.660]   put that towards making this into a better experience
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:30.140]   for you because again, factory fresh out of the box
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.820]   to a brand new user, I don't see intrinsic value
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.660]   to the way that the Apple ecosystem works together.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.020]   It's mostly stuff I think that works
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.980]   if you use independent sort of solutions.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.500]   - Well, and I have a couple of Android phones
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:50.380]   and a couple of iPhones and I have to say that,
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.820]   I mean, I'm fine with either one
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.020]   who go back and forth, it doesn't matter,
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.340]   but I would not, I still, I still, I still,
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.180]   I would not hand that to my parents.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.300]   You know, like I wouldn't have my parents try
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.500]   to use an Android phone, there's too many options.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.100]   You know, and, and, and, you know, for, you know,
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.660]   like I can't get my mom off a flip phone, you know?
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:11.260]   And so, so the, you know, the issue I think does get down
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.900]   to this, there is still, I think, an ease of use
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:18.900]   of a very specific way of, that is for a certain consumer,
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.300]   you know, worthwhile.
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.780]   And I think that, the other thing is I think
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.220]   that there is a level of consumer that,
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.500]   I mean, I think it's a little different now,
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:30.020]   there's a lot of, but if you look at who,
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:35.020]   in every time they do this, like, who is buying more software,
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:38.300]   who is buying more things on their phone,
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.780]   almost every single time, you know, it's iPhone users,
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.660]   you know, and I think that it's a certain cross-section
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.660]   and I don't think that that is slipping that much.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:49.500]   And I think that that is a huge value for Apple, you know,
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.180]   is that, is that it's not just that they buy the phone,
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.340]   it's that they're, they tend, the people who tend to do that,
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.900]   the cross-section of doing that tends to be also people
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.820]   who just buy things, you know, and I think that that's valuable
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.260]   to a lot of different, and we can talk about, you know,
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.860]   the global economic reasons for that and everything else,
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:09.140]   but the data is pretty much that the people who are buying
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.420]   iPhones and Macs, they're still, well, specifically iPhones,
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.300]   are tend to be purchasers, which is very valuable
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.020]   to a variety of brands and people trying to sell stuff.
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.660]   - I think even Apple's per user revenue was up,
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:21.900]   I think they said last year.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.900]   - Yeah, news from nowhere else.fr, they're, they're leak.
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:30.860]   I don't know how credible they are,
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.420]   I never heard of them, shows the iPhone casing.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.180]   And this is what you would expect to see, frankly,
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.460]   as we get closer to manufacture, with a bigger camera
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.140]   and dual speakers on the bottom.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:45.100]   Do you think this is real, is this a case, is this?
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.780]   - I mean, it's hard to tell because people,
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.580]   it's a game now and people will make stuff,
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.380]   where they'll do one also, they'll get prototypes
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.420]   or there's all sorts of things.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.260]   I mean, it doesn't seem incredible.
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:55.060]   - It kind of looks like a case, to be honest, so.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.700]   - I mean, that's one of the things is that,
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.980]   I can't say Apple doesn't make mistakes,
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.020]   again, like the no button iPod shuffle,
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.140]   but their job is to sell iPhones.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.620]   And if they decided that taking away a headphone jack
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.580]   would decimate their iPhone revenue,
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.460]   that's not where Jack would stay there forever.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.180]   But if they believe that it is getting harder
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.380]   to differentiate and there's something that they could offer
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.700]   that would make the iPhone seem different,
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.020]   and it's a gamble they're willing to take.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:18.100]   - What if they had dual speakers
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.900]   and they actually sent pretty good?
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.820]   My fingers across so hard, Leo.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:25.740]   - That might actually be enough
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.700]   to justify removing a headphone jack for me.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:29.740]   - Well, I don't know about that,
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:33.060]   but it's don't discount the ability to have really great sound
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.300]   coming out of a phone because, just like with the cameras,
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.620]   there's, it's possible to say,
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.380]   we can't really improve speaker technology,
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.740]   but we can synthetically make it sound a lot better,
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.300]   knowing that, knowing exactly this listening situation
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.980]   you're gonna be in when you listen to this thing,
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.740]   we can actually make it feel a lot bigger
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.260]   than it actually is by saying,
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:53.300]   we're not gonna be true to the original recording,
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.060]   we're gonna basically focus on the experience
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:55.900]   that we're giving you.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.780]   So there's a lot that could still be done
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.940]   on pretty much every phone.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.260]   I've seen demos of, not only in stuff I've seen shipping,
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.900]   but I've seen demos of, in certain labs,
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.540]   of just tiny, tiny little like granorized speakers
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.380]   that I would swear to God,
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.300]   there's a speaker somewhere underneath that table
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.780]   that I cannot believe that this is creating
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.660]   that level of sound.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.260]   It feels as though, it doesn't feel as though
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.340]   the sound is coming from there,
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.540]   it feels as though the sound is coming from like here instead.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.780]   So there's so much that can be done,
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:27.020]   just with synthetic processing.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.460]   - Boy, that would be cool.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.260]   Then I, okay, that might sell me,
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.060]   I mean, I don't, again, I don't wanna see people
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:35.540]   walking around on the street with their boom box iPhone
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:36.900]   blaring, but.
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:39.460]   - Hey, Commisserie, play me, whatever, really, really,
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.180]   - But there are, but there are, a lot of cases
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.940]   where you would, I listened to my phone speaker,
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:45.940]   coming out of my pocket,
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.620]   and if it really, if it sounded decent,
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.540]   especially, see, all I really need,
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.460]   music maybe is gonna be hard to do,
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:53.820]   decent bass and stuff like that,
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.220]   but if voice sounds pretty good,
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.540]   I'd be happy for audio.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:57.380]   - I'd be able to listen to it.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.220]   - I listened to it.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.060]   - I listened to it.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.900]   - Way better than the previous iPod iPads.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.980]   - Oh, that's really true, it sounds wonderful.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:02.900]   - And when I'm cleaning a lot,
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:04.260]   when I'm cleaning or sorting things,
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.900]   a lot of times I don't wanna necessarily have a headphone
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:07.340]   that's getting all caught up in everything,
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.100]   and so a lot of times I'm just setting my phone down around.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.500]   Now I have to admit that I usually use,
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.300]   because the speakers aren't quite powerful enough,
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.020]   I'm using some kind of external speaker
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.780]   that's Bluetooth then listening to,
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   whether it's podcasts or NPR or marketplace, whatever.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.700]   - Really, the only place that's an issue is traveling,
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.700]   like in a car and a subway and a bus,
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.540]   walking down the street.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.860]   - If you're in an office, you wanna block out other people?
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.100]   - I guess in an office,
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.020]   but then you probably have something else
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:35.860]   you could plug in.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.700]   - Oh yeah, your big hands,
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.540]   you're putting on your head.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.380]   - Yeah.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.100]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.260]   - I forgot how much, you know,
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.340]   'cause it's very, very rare for me
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:45.260]   not to have a headset with me.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:47.700]   And I realize how much of my little world lives inside of
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.300]   that I can just watch and do whatever I want.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.140]   - Is that about it?
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.500]   - And no one knows anything about it,
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.100]   like I'm just like sitting there watching, you know,
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.620]   Game of Thrones while I'm standing in line at the airport
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.540]   or whatever, you know, like,
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.500]   and it's just, I kind of go off into my own little world
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.220]   very quickly and I just realize how powerful the,
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.420]   how it has become, you know,
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.380]   and you get very surprised,
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.380]   like my biggest frustration with a lot of websites is that,
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.060]   you know, when I come to a computer,
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.300]   they make a lot of noise.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.420]   - Yeah.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:15.020]   This device in our pocket really has become the science fiction.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:15.860]   - Yeah.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.660]   - All in one computer thingy.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.300]   - It's all in the mother box.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.540]   - It is everything now.
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.580]   This is everything you need in life.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.260]   - Bernie, I recognize that Jack Kirby referenced
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:26.100]   and I praise you.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.300]   (both laughing)
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.140]   - Who's Jack Kirby?
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.060]   - Who's for you, Andy?
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:30.900]   (both laughing)
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.740]   - Third world?
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:34.500]   (both laughing)
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.820]   - Anything else to say before we take a break
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:40.620]   and go to our tips and picks of the week,
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.700]   we've got, you know,
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:46.060]   Betas coming out, I know Mac OS, Watch OS, TV OS.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.060]   - We did previews for all of them.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.260]   We did really long detailed previews.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.100]   - Oh good.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.020]   - It's ready to do the watch.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.380]   I knocked out the Mac and the TV.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.380]   - Nice.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.700]   Really good stuff.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.860]   Anything, particularly you think is worth highlighting?
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:00.380]   - Well, I mean, we've talked about a lot of it
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.940]   to death already, but just the user experience on the watch
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.900]   is so much better now and a lot of the features
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.020]   on the app TV, I think.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:07.860]   - Yeah.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.700]   - Like switch control.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.380]   There's a lot of important, really important accessibility
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.860]   stuff that they've baked in.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:14.540]   And just a lot of additional options on iOS
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.980]   that I think people will be discovering for weeks to come.
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:19.620]   - There's been some good deep dives on the ARS Technica
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:24.620]   on the new file system, including one by a ZFS developer
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:27.940]   who had both good and positive and negative things
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.180]   to say about APFS, the new Apple File System,
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.260]   which won't be out this fall,
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.820]   but in fact, we'll take a while to come out.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.820]   In fact, it's a really good read.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:37.580]   It's a very, very practical, realistic look at it
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.180]   because so much of this is just,
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.340]   he really sets the bar high
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.780]   with his first couple paragraphs,
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.580]   which he says, it really is the stage of the rehab
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.860]   where you're just bringing the building up to code.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:53.060]   So don't, it's basically taking 30 years
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.180]   of accumulated mess code and saying,
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.340]   we're throwing it all out, we're starting all over again.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:00.300]   We're basically creating a new structure that is solid
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.380]   enough that when we add stuff in the future,
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.740]   we're starting from a clean slave
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.140]   instead of starting from a mess.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.700]   And then he goes into a lot of the technical details
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.300]   about what's possible, what seems to be important.
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:13.260]   And the TLDR is that it seems to be,
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.580]   from a user perspective, the immediate benefit
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   is going to be as privacy security
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:25.980]   and the ability to do like incremental sort of backups
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.580]   and incremental sort of restores on the document level.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.700]   - And significant performance improvements as well.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.340]   - Yeah, but he gets that in detail best to read it directly.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.820]   Like I said, it's not, he's really, really knows his stuff,
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.540]   but he's also knows enough not to get people buried
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.700]   into bit level technical detail.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.140]   Like when he talks about really important,
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:48.140]   people don't understand that SSDs work differently
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.860]   than spending hard drives do.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:52.500]   And he does a really good job of explaining,
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.180]   here's why this has been, here's how it's been optimized
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.060]   for Silicon and here's what is actually going to work
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.540]   and what is maybe not terribly important.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.340]   - Adam Levensall, he's the co-author of D-Trace
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:07.100]   and a contributor to the ZFS project,
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.540]   which is widely considered by many to be
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.180]   the kind of the state of the art file system
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.540]   that Apple's emulating with.
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.060]   - His Twitter avatar is the resident icon,
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:17.500]   which means that I trust everything he says
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.340]   about any technical subject related to Apple.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.540]   - He is a geek.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.380]   (laughing)
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.060]   - That is very, very awesome.
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:27.540]   - I still miss the good old resident days.
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.380]   - Me too.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.620]   - Oh, resident.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.460]   - Oh wait a minute.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.380]   And he says he avidly reads you or read you
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.820]   in Macuser magazine when he was 10.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   - Oh, look at that.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:41.380]   - When he say that to someone who doesn't feel
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.460]   so they're that old, they don't think I could say is,
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.580]   "Oh, thank you, aren't part too sweet."
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.980]   - I'm getting it a lot lately, Andy.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.820]   Get ready.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:51.660]   - There's a lot of interesting stuff in there too
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.140]   that I don't know if it directly portends
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.380]   to future hardware, but stuff like the deep color,
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:57.580]   the wide color gamut is system wide now
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:59.980]   and it doesn't just support DCI-P3,
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.020]   but it supports Rec 2020 going forward
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.500]   and it's just across everything.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.540]   So whether we start seeing better displays
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.740]   in Mac laptops and iPhones, it'll be interesting.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.500]   Raw support is baked in everywhere now.
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.620]   So whether that takes advantage of the new cameras,
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:13.460]   super interesting.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.660]   Siri on the Mac could mean better microphones.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.340]   'Cause right now there's no direct voice activation,
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.300]   but if you have better Macs,
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.700]   better mics and a Mac, maybe in the future there will be.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.660]   So I think there's just a lot of it that we're seeing now,
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.820]   but when we get to the fall and we see the new hardware,
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.900]   I think it could be even more impressive.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.860]   - I'm counting on new hardware in the fall.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:31.940]   Count on it.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.900]   - Yeah, it's gonna get totally huge.
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:34.740]   - It's gonna get pretty good.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.140]   - A lot of what we talked about today really will rise
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.540]   or fall depending on what happens this fall.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.900]   It'd be interesting to see.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.740]   Let's take a break.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.660]   Come back with our final thoughts, your picks,
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.620]   your tips, your tricks, anything you wanna share
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.500]   with us Renee Ritchie from iMore.com,
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.980]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.340]   and of course from Pixelcore,
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:55.420]   it's our good friend Alex Lindsay,
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.420]   always nice to see you Alex.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:58.260]   - Good to be here.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.980]   - Our show today brought to you by Squarespace,
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:04.140]   the place to make your next website,
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.660]   whether you want a simple cover page.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:08.300]   That's actually, that's the gateway.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:10.300]   The gateway drug to Squarespace, that's what I did.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.740]   I said, I ought to try this cover page thing
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.460]   and you know it was really fun.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.860]   If you go to leo-loport.com,
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:19.620]   you can see how I got sucked in.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.220]   And then once you do that, you go,
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:23.700]   "Oh yeah, maybe I should have a few blog pages,
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.980]   a calendar, oh I can have links to all my social media
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.740]   presences, and so much fun.
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:32.140]   Pretty soon you can't stop."
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:35.140]   But the best part is you can do this for free right now.
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:36.460]   If you're a photographer,
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:37.900]   look at this full bleed design,
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.980]   a great way to make your perfect portfolio.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.020]   If you're a blogger, they've got all the tools,
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:43.540]   you can even post from your iPhone,
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:47.140]   your iPad, your Android device in a very, very nice app.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:51.020]   They've got commerce built into each and every template.
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.020]   In fact, the templates are kind of the secret.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.660]   When you start at Squarespace,
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:57.220]   you pick a template and there are many to choose from.
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.780]   And the thing is, these templates combine
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:02.740]   obviously beautiful design, they have great designers,
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.020]   but behind the scenes, the best engineering.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.260]   So you're getting really kind of the state of the yard.
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:10.100]   And that's one of the things that's tough these days
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:14.740]   in web, doing a website is the styles change,
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.180]   but also the engineering changes.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:18.380]   And it's not something you wanna try to keep up with
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:19.820]   or pay somebody to try to keep up with.
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:21.940]   Just have Squarespace do it.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.100]   This is, it's turnkey.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.220]   For instance, you're seeing now
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:28.540]   one of these really nice magazine style templates
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.220]   has a grid style landing page.
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:33.260]   So you can see all the posts at once, infinite scroll,
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.060]   which is very popular right now,
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.540]   related posts at the bottom,
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.140]   encouraging visitors to explore more.
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:40.300]   You can have author profiles.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.380]   You have integrated search in the header,
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.300]   which makes that very easy.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.340]   And again, it's image focused, which is wonderful.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.900]   I mean, if you have beautiful images,
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:53.820]   it really looks great, but it looks great on any size screen
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.060]   because it's mobile responsive.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.220]   That means no matter what size,
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.540]   whether it's a 27 inch Thunderbolt display
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:02.500]   or a little four and a half inch iPhone 3GS,
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.180]   it's gonna look great and fit.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.860]   I love that.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.500]   You get a free customized domain name
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.740]   when you sign up for a year at squarespace.com.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:14.340]   Of course, 24/7 customer support.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.740]   They also now sell domains.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.860]   They have access to 200 of the most popular top level domains,
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.300]   of course.com.net, but everything else too.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.780]   Purchase it at squarespace domains,
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:27.180]   and you'll get a clean, spam free parking page.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.380]   Unlike some of these other guys,
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.740]   your parking page looked great
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.540]   when you're ready to start building.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.380]   Build.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.300]   It's so great.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.820]   The commerce, there's nothing better.
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.140]   They recently introduced advanced analytics for commerce,
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.980]   which allow you to view the traffic in real time,
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.860]   but also see things like a band and checkout.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:47.020]   So you really could get a sense of how your commerce is working,
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.220]   device filtering, so you know,
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:51.900]   who's there and what they're getting there on and more.
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.260]   It's the only platform, unless you manage brand
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:56.500]   to create your store in a way that reflects
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.700]   your ethos, your style.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.900]   So it doesn't look like some add-on,
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.140]   tacked into your site.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.940]   It looks like your site.
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:08.540]   And of course, all the tools that you'd want with commerce.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.580]   They've just added something new.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.420]   I love this.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.820]   And a lot of us qualify,
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.220]   members who have built or contribute

[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:17.460]   And we have many here at Twitch.

[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.460]   I love that and more.

[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:54.060]   Time for all the picks of the week.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.940]   Let's start with Andy Inako.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:00.020]   - I'm gonna pick Plex this week.
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:02.700]   It's not new, obviously it's been around for,
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.340]   since about 2008, 2009.
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:07.860]   But this is the media server and playback
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.580]   kind of ecosystem that is,
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:14.820]   it looks like it's gonna replace iTunes on Apple for me.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:17.900]   And pretty much every media player I have on every device.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.500]   Because the past few weeks,
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.820]   I decided to really do a deep dive on it.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.180]   Plex is great because its job is to find the media
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:27.860]   that you have in whatever form that you have it
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:31.460]   and deliver to you on whatever device you have
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.980]   with in whatever format is useful to you on that device.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:39.260]   So for instance, I was able to simply drag my iTunes,
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.500]   show it my iTunes library after installing the Plex app.
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:44.380]   There's a, the app is free.
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:47.220]   If you give it a, if you subscribe for $40 a year,
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.300]   you can get all kinds of other services,
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.460]   but the basic app is free.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:55.300]   It will simply find your iTunes library, organize it,
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.900]   let you use it as a player, use it as a streamer.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:01.020]   And if the interface is I think is a lot cleaner
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.020]   and a lot nicer than iTunes.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.740]   But also I can have multiple libraries.
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:08.580]   So for instance, I'm in the process of re-ripping
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:10.500]   all of my CDs, 'cause I didn't,
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.900]   when I ripped them originally,
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.260]   I didn't rip them as lossless,
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.740]   I might have ripped them like 10 years ago almost.
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.340]   But instead of contaminating my main library,
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.820]   I can have a second library that I'm calling it,
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.740]   I'm calling this new library, My Loss.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:25.180]   That's just lossless complete albums
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:28.580]   where I've tuned all of the, I've tuned all of the tracklists,
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.220]   I've tuned all the album art, all that sort of stuff,
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:34.540]   but it doesn't mean I have to pick between one or the other.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.500]   They will both work in the same library.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:39.420]   So I can have playlists that combine, combine them all.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:43.460]   But when I go into my Roku box or my Apple TV,
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.820]   it's giving me this beautiful sofa level interface
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.100]   that I can also get access to all of that.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.220]   It will, when I sometimes download stuff off of YouTube,
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.660]   I capture stuff, I capture TV shows and video
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.060]   off of my cable box and off of my HDMI capture device.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.260]   So if I simply call this,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.980]   this is Bob's Burger season two, episode three,
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:07.140]   it will pull all of the information about that episode.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:09.940]   A synopsis, people who are on that show,
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:12.060]   related characters, related shows,
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.580]   and will populate this entire screen.
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:16.780]   You also, then you get the next step up.
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:19.020]   Let's say that I want to listen to some of that music
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:22.260]   on my, that uncompressed music on my,
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:26.380]   I'm sorry, lossless music on my iPhone or on my Android phone.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.220]   Well, it will transcode these 20 megabyte font size files
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:34.940]   down to MP, automatically into MP3s, nice compacts things.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.980]   When I tell them to the please,
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:38.460]   I'd like to put this playlist on my phone.
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:39.620]   I can do it all from the phone,
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.260]   and then suddenly without having to do any conversions
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.380]   of my own, it all happens in the background.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.780]   It lands in the device, similar for video.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:49.140]   If I have this nine gigabyte Blu-ray rip,
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:51.020]   if I say put it on my iPad mini,
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.700]   it will, if I wanted to, it can transcode it down
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.900]   to 720p in the background.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.900]   So it takes up much less space.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:59.700]   If I'm out away from the house,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.780]   it will basically turn my, that,
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:06.060]   that Plex server into a streaming,
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.700]   streaming version of iTunes.
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.300]   So I can access all of that stuff from wherever I am.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.820]   And the only downsides are that most people
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:17.340]   would be running this on a desktop machine,
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.700]   or a notebook that sometimes is turned on,
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.260]   sometimes is not turned on.
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.420]   So some of these features like,
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.060]   hey, I'm traveling somewhere and I want to get access to
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:28.500]   a playlist or a movie that I didn't actually load onto the device,
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:31.740]   that device has to be turned on and sort of standing by.
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.940]   So, but if you have a Mac mini that you can put into,
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.340]   put into a low power mode, it'll work there.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.940]   I have a Synology network attached storage.
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.740]   There is a version of Plex for that NAS.
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:47.700]   So basically I've got Plex running on that network
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:49.780]   attached storage device.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.220]   So truly that is the up 100% of the time, 24/7 machine,
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:55.900]   so that I can access this anywhere.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.860]   I think that for me, this is really the solution
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.580]   that I've been looking for all along,
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.780]   where there's a clear, it helps me find the music that I like,
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:06.900]   it helps me appreciate the music that I enjoy,
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:08.860]   and I just like how pretty it is.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.660]   It just makes it, it really is,
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:13.580]   when it comes to delivering a consumer level experience
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:18.020]   where I'm not necessarily want an app that manages my music library,
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:21.580]   so much as I want a piece of home audio gear,
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.220]   that makes it easy to find the album I want or discover stuff
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:27.260]   that I wasn't thinking of, but it's related to the mood that I'm in.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.820]   It's really, really great.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:32.260]   I signed up for the $40 a year Plex Pass,
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:35.620]   and I think that it won't be too long before I pop for the full 150 bucks
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:39.740]   for the lifetime pass, because they just keep expanding it
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.020]   and making it better and better each and every year.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.740]   It doesn't have an Apple Watch app, for instance,
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:49.420]   but it is open enough that other people have been able to write
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:51.180]   their own Apple Watch apps for it,
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.700]   so you still have access to that sort of stuff.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:55.780]   But if you go to the site, you'll see just this long line of,
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:00.020]   got a game, a home game system,
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:03.260]   it'll work on Sony, it'll work on Microsoft, Xbox,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:04.140]   it'll work on all this sort of stuff.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:07.500]   No matter what you have or what you're going to acquire in the next three or four years,
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.820]   you will be able to use Plex on it.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:11.420]   So I think it's a good investment into the future.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.060]   There's absolutely no lock in whatsoever.
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:17.980]   Very nice, of course. We all love Plex.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.100]   It's a great thing.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:23.100]   And I think there is a plugin for Twit on Plex.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.300]   I'm pretty sure there is.
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.140]   There used to be.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.900]   It's funny too. There are also streaming video channels that
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:30.300]   I'm not sure if I should really tell people about this,
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.380]   but normally if you want to see like CBS streaming programming,
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:38.500]   you have to subscribe to CBS All Access for $5 or $6 a month.
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:42.740]   But there is an official CBS channel in which all of that is there,
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:45.220]   not with that great like CBS All Access interface,
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:49.980]   but you can simply select full episodes late night,
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.580]   late show with Stephen Colbert.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:54.020]   And now you're watching the last weeks,
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:55.940]   the birth of episodes of Stephen Colbert Show.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.140]   So there's a lot of meat there.
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:00.940]   You just got to dig in for it and you'll find some really cool stuff.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.380]   Very nice.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.060]   Amazing.
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.380]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:09.340]   So I have two picks. One is a pick that actually can't have anything
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.100]   to do with the Mac right now, which makes me super sad.
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:15.020]   And that's because it's an HTC Vive game that I was playing last night.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.660]   And it is a lightsaber, not an official lightsaber simulator.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.060]   Were you over at Georgia's house playing with her vise?
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.140]   She was doing paintball.
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.660]   And then I didn't want to play the paintball game.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:25.660]   So she let me try it out.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.220]   I saw this. I saw you doing this.
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.580]   I didn't realize this.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.220]   So there's an arcade thing behind you.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.140]   Is that part of it?
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.860]   That's the computer that's running the PC that powers the--
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.900]   Oh, they put it in an arcade thing.
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:37.500]   Oh, my God.
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.980]   Yeah, because they also do arcade gaming on it.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:39.420]   Such kicks.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:39.940]   I love it.
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:42.460]   So I spent a lot of time studying Chinese culture.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.220]   I did a lot of double knife training when I was young.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.460]   And I've always loved lightsabers.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.780]   And this-- I fight had this when I was training.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.060]   It would have been remarkable.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:52.420]   But even now, just the ability to actually do that lightsaber--
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:54.460]   and again, it's not an official Lucas sanction thing,
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:57.460]   although hopefully ILM will get into that at some point.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:59.020]   But it's just remarkable.
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.340]   And it's basically a display if people aren't familiar
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.580]   with the HTC Vive.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:03.540]   It's a VR display.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.980]   You plug into a PC, and it lets you play all these incredibly
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.020]   immersive games.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.260]   And part of the reason why I really
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.380]   hope there is a new Mac Pro, or at least a substantially
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.060]   powerful Apple computer, is that right now it
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.140]   doesn't run on any existing Mac.
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:15.260]   People try to hack it in there.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:18.420]   But the graphics cards are powerful on the Mac Pro,
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.340]   but they don't work together.
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:22.340]   So independently, they're not powerful enough separately.
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:24.420]   And even if you could combine them, maybe not.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:25.140]   It's still old enough.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.140]   It's three years old.
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:28.140]   And this is why I really want a powerful graphical Mac,
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:30.060]   because I have Windows laptop down there,
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.180]   but that's not going to run it.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.140]   And I don't want to have to buy a whole Windows box just to do
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:33.340]   this.
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.060]   I'd much rather--
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:34.660]   Yeah, that's what we did.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.380]   And I'm sure this is what Georgia did as well.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:36.900]   She did.
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.500]   She totally did.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.100]   She bought a really powerful Windows box.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.980]   I think two of them, because she has the Oculus now, too.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.180]   And it's just not-- it's not ideal.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.660]   So this game was enough to make me start looking at buying
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:49.500]   the Vive myself, and then start looking at having to buy
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.500]   a computer to support it.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.780]   So I was super sad.
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:53.220]   So I hope that one leads me.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.660]   What's the name of this one?
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.700]   This one is-- I have it right here.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.740]   It's Light Blade VR.
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:41:59.540]   Light Blade VR.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.900]   And it's on Steam, of course.
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.760]   And there's another game-- my little God's
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.140]   Hung Gabriel loves, which is just a complete dungeon crawl
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:06.700]   game.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:07.540]   It's like that one.
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:08.300]   It's called now.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:12.100]   But it's just a guy putting together a bunch of epic unreal
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:13.700]   footed elements together.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:16.100]   And it's remarkable what people are--
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.180]   We have a lot of fun, but you know what's interesting?
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.820]   Our Vive-- we have a Rift and a Vive.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.060]   We hardly ever use a Rift.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.940]   In fact, I guess not at all anymore.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:25.660]   We use the Vive.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:29.620]   And Megan's kids come in here a lot and play it.
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:31.100]   The kids love it.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.180]   It is a very compelling gaming platform.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.980]   I don't like the Oculus as much because it's kind of sit
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.420]   down and there's no hand controllers yet.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.220]   And I really find it disturbing not to see hands.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.020]   It's kind of fun, really.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:41.300]   With the Vive, you have to have enough room because it's--
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:41.740]   Yes.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.460]   You have to set up a room for it without obstacles.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.780]   It was such a good workout, Leo.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:45.940]   And like half an hour went by.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:47.500]   I was sweating.
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.300]   And I just-- I didn't even know I was working on it.
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:50.420]   It was just so much fun.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:53.100]   So to make it up to the Apple-efficient autos,
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.620]   HomeScreen.me relaunched, I believe it was today.
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.820]   I'm sure everyone here gets asked what their home screen
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:00.220]   looks like all the time.
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:01.860]   So this just makes it super easy.
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:03.420]   You can log in with Twitter or Facebook.
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:06.140]   You can upload your watch and your phone screenshot.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:08.500]   And then anytime anyone asks you what you're using,
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:09.620]   you just give them this link.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.980]   And you can update it as often as you want.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.860]   And I'm not sure if everybody needs it as a service,
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.620]   because maybe what is on your home screen
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:18.020]   is not that important to everybody.
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:18.940]   But I like it.
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.220]   And mine is almost always default, so I apologize.
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.940]   I just reinstall all the time and switch devices a lot.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.620]   So the only way I can remember where apps are
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:27.660]   is if I leave them where Apple put them.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:30.500]   But there's a lot of really interesting productivity,
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.460]   optimized home screens, and a bunch of people sharing them.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.780]   And if you're looking for ideas for apps or a layout
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:36.940]   so that you can be more efficient,
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.460]   it's a great place just to browse around.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:42.660]   This is a really good idea for sharing your home screens.
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:43.820]   I really like this.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:45.420]   It's not iPhone only.
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:46.300]   It's Android as well.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.980]   So you can do it.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.740]   You have a home screen we'll carry.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.460]   Or is it only iPhone?
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.260]   I think this one might be iPhone.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.580]   I got fooled because that's the HTC One Wallpaper.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:57.380]   But you know what?
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:58.860]   I think it's only iPhone.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:43:59.540]   And Apple Watch.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:02.260]   So you can do Apple Watch now as well.
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:04.100]   Really people have Apple Watch home screens
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.380]   that they were proud of?
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.020]   Well, especially now because applications,
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:10.780]   Apple is positioning the watch face
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:12.220]   is almost like a launcher.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.940]   And the complications are getting much more powerful.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:17.220]   So you'll be able to arrange these watch faces.
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:19.740]   Like I have one for movies that just has a very low power
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:20.540]   time on it.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.380]   And some people have them for travel
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.700]   because it has a destination and the current time
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:26.540]   and a stopwatch for flight time.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.820]   But other people are putting new complications in there.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:32.740]   Things for productivity or things for whatever occupation,
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:34.700]   like maybe they have their pager in there.
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.860]   And you'll just launch the app.
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:37.500]   And any app that's in a complication
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.540]   stays resident in memory.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.060]   So they launch super fast.
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:41.780]   So instead of having to even go to a glance
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.500]   or to go to the dock, you can just launch things
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.100]   straight from the watch face.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.100]   So I think they're going to become more and more important.
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:48.900]   This would be so much more interesting if you could use
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.260]   Android.
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:52.020]   Really, iPhone, HomeScreens aren't free.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.700]   There's not a whole lot of variations.
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:54.500]   Just a bunch of icons.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.340]   Nobody knows that.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.300]   Nobody uses an iPhone.
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:58.020]   No, they don't know what they're missing.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:58.500]   I guess.
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:44:59.820]   We think it's wondrous for I guess.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.300]   This is the most sophisticated one.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.820]   No icons.
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:06.060]   Just a bunch of folders.
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:07.420]   One of the people I work with, Laurie,
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:10.420]   she just has her home screen covered in folders filled with apps.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.860]   And to me, it's impenetrable.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:14.620]   But to her, it's like just everything at a couple of times.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:17.340]   I have my home screen has single icons
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:19.940]   and then second and third screen are folders.
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:22.740]   For me, folders are like a place that apps go to die.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:23.940]   Like, oh, you're right.
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.940]   As soon as they're there, I don't--
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:27.100]   I just stop registering them.
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.100]   And I've decided to--
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.300]   every time the one thing I don't do
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:32.860]   is I don't restore my new iPhones.
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:35.060]   Every time I get a new iPhone, I don't install anything.
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:35.540]   I start over.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.580]   Like, oh, I need that app.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:37.740]   And then I put it on.
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:38.860]   Otherwise, you just--
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:40.020]   I mean, I have too many apps.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.780]   iOS 10, you can 3D touch on a folder now.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:45.220]   And if you have badges in there, it'll
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:47.140]   show you the number of badges on the app.
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.820]   And you can very quickly get to the ones that are the most
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:50.660]   active.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:51.620]   It's a little improvement.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:53.740]   Why has no one done this for Android phones?
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.460]   It's very odd.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.500]   Opportunity people.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.260]   I guess so.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:03.220]   Home screen.me for iPhone and Apple Watch.
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.620]   I've got a very geeky pick.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:09.460]   I'll do it now so that we'll save the expensive multi-Alex
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.260]   pick for last.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:14.460]   It's not a small multi-Alex.
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.260]   By the way, I don't know if they've talked to you yet.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:22.340]   But we've decided we want to do a special screen savers
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.860]   Suvide edition.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:24.380]   Ooh.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:25.700]   You've got the ANOVA.
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.420]   And Andy, you're going to be--
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:28.860]   I just got the mellow--
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:30.580]   well, I didn't get the mellow yet,
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.060]   but they charge my credit card, which is a start.
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.180]   Things are moving.
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:38.540]   And so we thought we would have a special edition Suvide.
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.780]   And Andy, if you want to come in by a Skype,
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:42.900]   you can do that because I'm going to steal your technique
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:45.220]   of Suvide in a piece of me and then using a blowtorch
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:45.940]   to sear it.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:46.860]   So great.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:48.260]   I have both of those.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.220]   I could have some--
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:49.980]   Do you have your mellow?
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.140]   Did it come?
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:52.660]   Oh, I don't have the mellow.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:53.820]   But I have the--
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.140]   Blowtorch and this.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.260]   I have the Sears all.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:57.980]   I have two different Suvide devices.
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:01.300]   And I'm sure I've told you my wonderful breakthrough
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.500]   discovery of microwave burritos in our Suvide.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:05.500]   I know.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.660]   Whoa.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.940]   I'm saying I'm totally in on this.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:08.580]   It's next level.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:09.580]   Whoa.
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:10.580]   Whoa.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:11.580]   Microwave burritos.
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.780]   Oh, as long as you're not vegetarian, I'm in.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:14.780]   Critical key.
[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:18.060]   Oh, what an interesting idea.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.020]   Carried chicken.
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:24.780]   I had a thought and I had frozen microwave burritos in the fridge.
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.460]   Like the good premium line.
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:28.260]   And it works perfectly.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:29.860]   It's wonderful.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.060]   All right, so that's coming up.
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:34.180]   But now I'm really hungry.
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:37.060]   But my picky-- you know, I've been doing a lot of command
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.540]   line stuff because I'm a big fan of the command line.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.260]   One of the reasons I love Macs is because you have access
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.740]   to Bash in the Bash shell and the command line.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:47.780]   I actually use Fish shell, which I've talked to you about before.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.980]   But I found on GitHub a really interesting set of command line
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:54.220]   tools for developers.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:59.460]   It's a GitHub project, Mac CLI by Guarino Gabriel.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.340]   And what it does is it gives you--
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:04.940]   it's kind of like a very elaborate alias system.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:08.780]   They all begin with the word Mac and then followed by a space.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:11.100]   And it gives you a huge-- and by the way, you have to also
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:14.380]   have Homebrew and Git and PIP and Pyp of you
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.260]   are in Python installed, which is fairly common for people
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:20.180]   who use the command line a lot on OS 10.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.220]   And then it gives you this incredibly long list
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:27.060]   of very useful commands that you can just say, for instance,
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:33.100]   type Mac space time or Mac space lock or Mac space apps
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:34.740]   colon close all.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:38.060]   And these are going to give you very, very quick command
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:40.740]   line access Mac space speed test.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.100]   Give you a quick speed test.
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:43.100]   I just--
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.460]   the Mac is the speed test infinite.
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.740]   Infinite runs it every five minutes.
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:48.220]   Keep going.
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:49.900]   Going to a very large bill if you're not careful.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.660]   Keep going.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:58.460]   For LAMP clients, they have SQL, MySQL queries, PHP.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:00.500]   There's SSH utilities.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.820]   It really is a very nice complete set.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.500]   And if you're new to the command line, of course,
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:08.020]   you could do all of these if you know what command to use.
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.460]   That's not hard to find out.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.900]   But this will give you a set.
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.780]   And of course, when you first install it,
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:18.660]   you can just type the word Mac and get a list of all
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:21.100]   the possible commands and utilities.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:23.420]   So it's just kind of a cheat sheet.
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:25.020]   For a lot of the command line utilities,
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:28.100]   people may not even know about on the Mac and touch.
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:28.660]   I really like this.
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:29.900]   We could type to Siri.
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:31.500]   Just let me type to these things.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:31.980]   This is so great.
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:33.940]   I think-- look, I love a mouse.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:34.740]   I love a GUI.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:36.020]   I'm not abandoning the GUI.
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.580]   But I have to say there is a lot to be said for keeping
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:41.620]   your fingers on the home row and your keys and your hand
[01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:42.100]   off the mouse.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.660]   It's the quality thing where when you change context,
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:44.220]   you forget.
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:45.940]   I'll get a Slack notification.
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:46.460]   I'll go there.
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:47.300]   I'll see something else.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:47.660]   I'll do it.
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.340]   I'll leave Slack.
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:49.500]   I'll remember the notification.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:49.900]   Go back.
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.460]   Do something else.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:50.940]   Leave it again.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:52.300]   I see myself.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.500]   So I really wish that at some point, I'm in messages.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.580]   I could just type @Calendar@appointment.
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.100]   I'm in messages like a type @Siri wins the movie playing.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.620]   And never have to change context.
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:02.900]   Just direct whatever text I want to type to that thing
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:04.260]   and just have it work everywhere.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:06.300]   Completely agree.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.740]   So when I get in command line mode,
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:08.860]   I stay in command line mode.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:10.380]   And I really like it.
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:13.540]   I even have a command line to do list, and calendering,
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.020]   and everything.
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:15.740]   So this is kind of cool.
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:24.020]   It's from Gabriel Guarino, G-U-A-R-I-N-O-G-A-B-R-I-E-L on GitHub.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.500]   You can clone it, download it.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.300]   He has installation instructions.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:30.900]   And begin your command line journey.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:31.780]   So great.
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:36.060]   And now, let's get Lindsey.
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:38.060]   Alex Lindsey is pick of the week.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.380]   So this one's probably no one's ever heard of before.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:43.500]   Not many people about it.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:44.500]   I like that.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.180]   But one of the things that a lot-- whether you're
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:49.180]   at a church or a school or you're doing a corporate presentation,
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.540]   there's a bunch of things that you
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.380]   have to figure out as far as doing basically
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:55.100]   all these presentations.
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:56.620]   You might have multiple monitors.
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.340]   So one of the things really popular right now
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:00.660]   is you have three or four different projectors
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:02.140]   that are all against each other.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:04.180]   You have to blend those together and make it all look
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.980]   like one long screen.
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:08.380]   And then you want to have the lights tuned in with the video.
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:09.860]   You want to be able to interact with it.
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:11.340]   You want to have little things to tap on it.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.260]   And all those things you don't think are important when you start.
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:16.940]   I mean, we all start with keynote against a projector
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:18.260]   on a screen.
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:21.260]   But when you get into these larger corporations,
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.260]   a lot of this stuff becomes very complex.
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.340]   And it doesn't have to be something that only
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:26.940]   is done by these big companies.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.900]   It's something that now-- I mean, it used to be.
[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:32.500]   But I have a piece of hardware that does that.
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:36.420]   And it was $80,000 piece of hardware that does this.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:41.740]   And now that blends these things across screens
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.700]   and does all this stuff really cool.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.300]   But now you can do a lot of that.
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:47.700]   I mean, all of it, but a lot of it on your Mac.
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:51.020]   And with a program called Malumin.
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:52.580]   And right now, Malumin 2, I think,
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.580]   is the one that's a version 2 that's come out.
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:56.500]   And it's not a replacement for a spider, which
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:57.700]   is what I was talking about there.
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:00.700]   But it is a-- but it is a different--
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:02.820]   basically, even if you're not interested,
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.500]   and you're not going to do any presentations today or tomorrow,
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.500]   it's worth looking at because it is
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:11.580]   some crazy geek fun of having a program that's
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:16.820]   playing video and playing different, basically, timelines
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:19.620]   that can activate lights, LEDs, MIDI.
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.940]   You can have interactions coming in from Connect
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:23.940]   and Arduino and Leap Motion.
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:26.940]   And you can tie this into different applications,
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.900]   write your own.
[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.100]   You can have all kinds of things that are activating it,
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:33.020]   all kinds of things that it activates.
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.220]   And in addition to that, of course, it blends screens
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:39.860]   and does a lot of other things, maps, big projections.
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:42.420]   And hopefully, the goal by recommending
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:44.860]   is-- and the version that I'm--
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:46.460]   there's a lot of different versions.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:50.900]   I mean, obviously, I have things like 800 bucks for the app.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.860]   And it's a fraction of what a lot of these things
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.700]   oftentimes cost.
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.780]   But if you're looking at whether, again,
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:01.420]   whether it's your school or your church or your company
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:02.980]   and you want to do something that's kind of--
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:06.140]   or your little league, whatever you're
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.100]   doing the presentation for.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.740]   And you want to take it kind of to that next level.
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:11.900]   It's definitely worth downloading a 30-day version
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:14.660]   and playing with it a little bit, watch their videos.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:18.620]   It's just amazing the kind of interaction
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.420]   that has kind of grown up around this application,
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.860]   specifically, which I think is-- a lot of us
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:25.820]   haven't heard of it because it's a European company,
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:26.660]   I think, a French company.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.300]   But it is-- it's pretty cool.
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:30.980]   And it was one of those things that only over the last year
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.980]   or so, more-- I started seeing more and more of this--
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:38.860]   you see the apps because we spend a lot of time backstage
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:40.180]   behind big events.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:42.900]   And so you kind of look at what apps everybody's using.
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:46.900]   And you slowly start seeing this app showing up everywhere.
[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:49.900]   And so anyway, if that's the kind of thing you're thinking
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:54.020]   about, I know it's pretty vertical as far as what
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.260]   you might be interested in there.
[01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:57.100]   But it's a pretty nifty thing.
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:58.820]   And even if you're not interested in doing this,
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:01.260]   just look at what this app does because it's just fascinating
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.820]   to see all the interactions and all the things
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:05.140]   that you can do with something like that.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.780]   So I'm watching the Vimeo video on there,
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:10.460]   front page, which are primarily dance performances.
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:13.460]   So explain to me.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:18.020]   So they're using a lumen to project onto the wall
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:20.460]   or sometimes a screen in front of the dancer.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:22.540]   Is that a prefabbed thing or is it
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.220]   responding to his movements?
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:25.180]   It's prefabbed.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:28.620]   So he is coordinating his movements.
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:30.180]   Yeah, I think he's coordinated.
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:31.180]   I'm looking at it right now.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:32.700]   I think he's coordinating with it.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:34.420]   This is the one that's kind of interesting
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:35.700]   is where she's interacting with what
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.900]   looks like wispy smoke coming out of the floor.
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.740]   I guess if it was even if it's canned,
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.460]   she would learn the dance that goes along with it.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.060]   But you're saying that--
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:47.500]   And there might be ways to set up that.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.260]   But I have a feeling that a lot of this stuff
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:53.780]   is very tightly mapped and tightly planned.
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:58.580]   So what's an idea is you could make light shows
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.100]   that you could project.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:02.460]   Well, yeah, and I think this is a very-- this light show
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.540]   is-- unfortunately, I think the unfortunate thing
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.580]   about this video that they're showing on their front page,
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:07.340]   it looks really cool.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.060]   And I'm sure they're very excited about it.
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:11.420]   But it's not really what I see on a day-to-day basis
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.660]   of how people use this app.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:14.780]   What they're using it for is if you look at--
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:15.420]   if you look at it--
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.700]   It's a performance thing.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:19.340]   Well, if you look at a huge corporate event
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:21.580]   and you see videos that are going all the way across
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.260]   this big, wide screen--
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:25.180]   and you see things popping up all over the place,
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:27.460]   and then you'd like to go do something else,
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:28.620]   that's really what it's used for.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.140]   This is a very esoteric-- what they're
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.060]   showing on their front page is a very esoteric version
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.140]   of what is used.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:36.380]   And I think that if you-- there's probably
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:37.460]   a couple other examples here.
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.380]   You can see light control.
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.380]   If you click through a couple of these,
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:41.220]   you might-- you know, of course,
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:45.100]   they're going to show what they think is the most impressive.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:47.020]   But it's not really--
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:50.260]   What's the use case you think might be the most?
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:51.780]   Well, it's building--
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.740]   Could you use it with a DMX controller to do light?
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:55.860]   Well, you can do-- you can use light.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:59.380]   But what the number one use case I see it for is, again,
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:01.260]   blending screens and then blending effects that
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.340]   go across many screens and appear on many locations,
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:05.620]   you know, all over the place.
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:08.460]   And I think that Europe is ahead of the United States
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.900]   in development of this.
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:12.860]   There's this-- there's another one that's
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:16.540]   much more complex called Ventus that is--
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.860]   literally lets you program a lot of this stuff very, very
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:20.380]   deeply.
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:23.420]   It's used in game shows and big events and everything else.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:26.940]   And so, you know, Europe, I think,
[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:29.220]   it's much more popular to do a lot of this stuff.
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.420]   So we see a lot more of it there.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:34.820]   But there's a lot of bread and butter solutions
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:40.340]   of just making a larger-than-life event.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:43.300]   If you're looking at trying to move outside of the standard
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:45.980]   16x9, one screen up there and you
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:47.180]   want to have a bunch of other things
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:49.020]   and then also tie in your lights and then also tie in--
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.980]   So you see this a lot of rock concerts, too,
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:53.260]   with these very lovely objections and stuff.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.820]   So this would be the kind of the controller software
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:58.500]   that would let you generate and then play back
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.100]   those projections.
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:01.220]   For a lot of different things.
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:02.620]   Yeah, and a lot of those rock concerts
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:04.020]   use all kinds of things.
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:06.060]   But this would be one of the things that might be used for that.
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:09.300]   And again, what I see it most is in--
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:12.300]   is specifically related to big corporate events
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:14.940]   and educational events that I've been to,
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.660]   where you're in the background.
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.860]   And that's how they're mapping across these huge LED
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.660]   walls or blended screens.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.780]   Is there using this app to do that?
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:24.220]   Very interesting.
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:25.460]   You're wondering how that--
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.540]   And also, if you're sitting in one of those things
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.020]   and you wonder how that happens, you watch these
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:31.140]   and you'll understand how that gets designed.
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.180]   And it's truly--
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.020]   I mean, it's incredible.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:36.100]   It's both technical and artistic.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:39.700]   And it's to do this kind of work.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.020]   And I'm playing with it.
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.700]   I'm playing with it so I know what to ask when
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:44.500]   I hire a professional to do it.
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.500]   That's right.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:47.460]   I don't have any expectation of me becoming
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.740]   an expert at this application.
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:53.420]   But I play with it a lot to just noodle with what can it do
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:56.900]   so that I don't ask completely stupid questions when I hire
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:58.020]   someone who's been doing it for five years.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.220]   It does look like it has a component that would allow you
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:02.340]   to do it in real time because they say it supports
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:04.460]   to connect our Arduino Leap motion.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:06.340]   Yeah, you should be able to do those kinds of things
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.740]   where you're tying those things in.
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:10.460]   So you can dance in front of your Xbox One
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:12.020]   and it would make funny shapes.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:13.780]   Theoretically, yep.
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:16.460]   I can't wait.
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:19.780]   And it is only half an Alex, but free for 30 days.
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.500]   Yeah, I would definitely download it.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.900]   Watch all the videos, then download it and play with it.
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:26.860]   And even, again, it's just like looking into this and--
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:30.940]   some of these apps that people use in these huge events
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.740]   are just fascinating just to see all the interactions
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:36.660]   that someone has built for something that is done every day.
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.020]   I mean, these kinds of things are being used all day,
[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:41.460]   every day in different locations.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:44.060]   And here's a free pick from somebody in the chat room
[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:48.060]   who passed along slither.io, works on any browser.
[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:49.420]   It's not Mac specific.
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:50.780]   And it's a game where you're trying
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:52.340]   to eat as many of these little dots
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:56.100]   and get as big as you can before bouncing into--
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.900]   You can get it on the App Store, too, if you want it on.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:58.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.940]   Oh, cool.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:00.940]   I sounded familiar.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.540]   Have you picked it before?
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:03.380]   Looks good.
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:04.540]   No, but it's super popular.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.900]   It's very fun.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:09.220]   But watch out, because some of these snakes are pretty big.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:13.420]   And they'll do everything they can to engulf you.
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:16.780]   Because then they get to eat your dots.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:17.420]   It's his life.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:19.500]   Look at-- there's a big American flag snake.
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.500]   Oh, somebody ate him.
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.100]   Oh, somebody ate me.
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:23.100]   Slither.io.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:29.540]   I just thought-- another time suck in case you didn't have enough.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:30.500]   But it's a classic.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:32.740]   It's a classic time suck.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:35.060]   Oh, and then Java Man's giving me another one--
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:36.820]   d-e-i-p.io.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:39.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, before we really go down this rabbit hole,
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:41.220]   let's wrap things up.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:42.380]   It's time for security now.
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:46.500]   We've got games to play, people to go, people to see,
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:47.060]   people to--
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:47.780]   Burritos to heat.
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.860]   Burritos to heat, or to Suvide.
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:54.700]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun times his website, cwob.com.
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:57.460]   Thank you so much, as always.
[01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:58.260]   Always fun.
[01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.980]   As always.
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:03.700]   And don't forget his other podcast, Andy's in Almanac.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:04.620]   Almanac, amanak.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:06.140]   And not goes Almanac.
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:08.900]   [SINGING]
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:10.900]   [LAUGHING]
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:11.300]   Where is that?
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:12.340]   Five by five, right?
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:13.340]   On five by five, duckie.
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:13.820]   On five by five.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:17.020]   And then it relayed FM material.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:18.020]   Material.
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:20.540]   If you want to hear it from the other side,
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:23.140]   get your folks listening to material to do a home screen.me
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:24.860]   for Android.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:25.700]   That's what we should--
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.620]   I will propose that.
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:27.540]   That's a good idea.
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:28.100]   Yeah, that'd be cool.
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:29.020]   Shifty home screens.
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.020]   Yeah.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:33.580]   Just like Adam Savage has doing for the Maker Week
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:36.740]   is saying, everybody show me a picture of your maker's space,
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:38.620]   like your workshop, your workbench.
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:40.740]   And it's immensely fascinating just
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:43.220]   to see how people set up their own little work tables.
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.620]   And I think that's the screenshots of desktop
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.540]   to the same way.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:49.420]   Thank you so much, Renee Ritchie.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:51.020]   iMoor.com is the place to go when
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:53.820]   you want to figure out if these rumors make any sense at all.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:56.900]   If you want to find out how to use your Apple device.
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:59.300]   And of course, they've got the nicest people in the world.
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.260]   Oh, I think you can.
[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:00.940]   It's great.
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:01.780]   iMoor.com.
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:04.100]   And Renee has about 18 podcasts of his own.
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:06.340]   I've cut down.
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:08.020]   Still doing debug, though, right?
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.340]   Yeah, actually, recording tomorrow
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:11.660]   with two very recently former Apple designers.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.260]   I think people will be super excited about it.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.420]   Love that.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:17.380]   And of course, Mr. Alex Lindsey, who
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:20.380]   does many mysterious things that he can't talk about.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.300]   But you'll find out more at pixelcore.com
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:24.940]   or follow him on Twitter @Alex.
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:26.300]   Lindsey, where is your next--
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:28.780]   where are your travels taking you next?
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:30.300]   I am--
[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:32.100]   What am I doing?
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.100]   This is even though.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.700]   He just has somebody come over in a car.
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:37.660]   He gets in the car and ends up somewhere.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.780]   Yeah, we have Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:42.780]   And then--
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:43.380]   We're in August.
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:44.540]   --of the final tap.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:51.140]   And then Nigeria and Rwanda and somewhere in the Middle East.
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:52.220]   Coming soon.
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:53.820]   Yeah, those are the next six weeks.
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.940]   Jeez, Louise.
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.180]   Jeez, man.
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:59.300]   Well, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:00.540]   It's always nice to see you.
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:01.660]   Hey, one more thing.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:04.660]   I know many of you participated in our annual Twit audience
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:07.100]   survey at the beginning of the year, which
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:11.260]   is really valuable for us in our programming and advertising
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:11.820]   practices.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:13.180]   That was something we did personally
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:17.860]   our partner for so many years, PodTrack Analytics
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:22.140]   is looking for avid podcast fans, including Twit listeners,
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:24.500]   but not exclusively Twit listeners,
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:26.860]   to chime in and provide anonymous information
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:29.260]   about the trends and needs of podcast audiences.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.860]   And they've asked us to let you know they're
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:35.580]   looking for people to join PodTrack's audience panel.
[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:37.100]   And you can find out what's involved.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:38.300]   It doesn't require travel.
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:39.940]   It's an easy thing to do.
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:41.540]   But if you'd like to influence--
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:43.780]   not just our shows, but podcasting in general.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:45.180]   This is a great way to do that.
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:49.940]   So if you listen to a lot of podcasts, visit PodTrack, P-O-D-T-R-A-C,
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:53.580]   PodTrack.com/panel.
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:56.220]   And you can find out more where they've been.
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:03:01.340]   They've really been for almost a decade helping us
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:04.980]   get advertising on the show and keep the show doors open.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:10.380]   And so we're glad to help them out to podtrack.com/panel.
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:11.940]   Thanks to all of you for tuning in.
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:15.420]   We do Macbreak Weekly, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern Time.
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:20.260]   That's 1,800 UTC at twit.tv/live.
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:24.180]   You can watch live and join the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:24.940]   Or be in the studio.
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.180]   We had a massive studio.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:28.780]   It's really nice to see you all.
[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:32.820]   Most of these shows, people leave as the show goes on.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.580]   But this, for some reason, unaccountably,
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:37.460]   more people arrived as the show went on.
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.140]   So if you want to be in studio email,
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.260]   we've actually run out of seats.
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:43.100]   Tickets at twit.tv.
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:44.980]   We'll make sure we can get a chair out for you.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.620]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:49.580]   And unfortunately, I must say this now.
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:51.380]   It's time to get back to work because you know what?
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:53.300]   Great time is over.
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:54.300]   Bye-bye.
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:57.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:00.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.240]   (upbeat music)
