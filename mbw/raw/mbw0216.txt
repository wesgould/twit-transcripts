[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.120]   Less and less Macintosh, more and more iPhone and iPad
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.800]   and iPod.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.880]   And here he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.720]   The Buffont of all knowledge, Mr. Chris Brings,

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.240]   And always a welcome guest on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   Hi, Chris.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.680]   Hi, Liam.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   Great to be here.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.200]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.160]   Filling in for Alex Lindsay, who has the day off.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.320]   He's traveling.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.600]   Andy, you're not co-sear, too, from Point East
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.560]   and the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   Speaking of Point East, I might be a little bit off my game
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.120]   this week because I used to be in a chair facing East.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   Now I'm actually facing North.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.440]   So I don't think that's going to have any effect on my performance
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.040]   today.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.640]   I'm hoping that we can just get past it.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.000]   I really probably shouldn't even mention it.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   But I don't have that out there.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.240]   Because otherwise people will be Twittering saying, hey,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.640]   does it look like Andy's facing North this time?
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520]   He's a little bit off of azimuth.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.120]   It's time to--
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.840]   Well, and I think there's a Feng Shui issue in the--
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.320]   It's like the elephant in the room, the--
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   The face is facing the mouth of the dragon.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.320]   Yeah, the Feng Shui in the room is big.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440]   Actually, the Feng Shui in the room,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.120]   I came in very early yesterday.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.040]   For some reason, even though Microsoft is in Seattle,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.440]   they decided to hold their Windows 7 launch event at 9.30
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.880]   Eastern times, 6.30 Seattle time.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.560]   But I was here in the studio.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   I was the only one.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.640]   I was unshaven.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.280]   I was wearing slippers and jammies.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520]   But I was here at 6.30 in the morning.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.760]   And we finally have-- we have a Windows Phone 7.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   Nine devices rolled out by Steve Ballmer.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   Ralph de la Vega, the CEO of AT&T was there
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.480]   to talk about the three devices AT&T will offer November 8.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.880]   T-Mobile will have two devices mid-month, they say mid-November.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.960]   All of them share many of the same characteristics,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   unlike Google.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   Microsoft has a reference hardware platform
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.400]   that they want everybody to adhere to.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.320]   Gigahurt Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm, sorry Intel.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.440]   800 by 480 screen, although the screen sizes range from 3 and 1/2
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.480]   to 4.3 inches.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.200]   5 megapixel camera.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.640]   I do believe that some of these have front-facing cameras.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.200]   Some of the screens are LCD Samsung
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.600]   will be doing AMOLED screens.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.240]   There's a differing amount of storage
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   ranging from 8 to 16 gigabytes.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.720]   But these are all very similar.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   And they're all running what is a completely redesigned user
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.600]   interface.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.480]   Looks a lot like the Zoom HD.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.160]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.480]   Did you look at these?
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.200]   And boy, am I really excited about getting my hands
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.560]   on one of these for real in-depth testing.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.520]   I was trying to think about something to say about it
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.720]   in a column this morning.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.240]   And the best I could come up with is how excited it was
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.920]   when Conan O'Brien started taking over late night.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.240]   Because you had David Letterman, who totally changed
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.400]   what the talk show could look like.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.000]   And then everybody said, wow, that's good.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.160]   Let's do a show that's like that.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.680]   And so you had the "You're Sitting at a Hall of Show."
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.080]   You got all these shows that copied it.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.240]   But then you had the first people who said, OK, that's good.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.800]   But let's do something that is not obviously a copy of this one
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.240]   that obviously influenced so many others.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.320]   So I mean--
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.760]   So you're saying it's no coincidence that Conan O'Brien is
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.120]   also launching November 8 on TBS.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.520]   They should advertise.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.520]   But--
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.240]   And maybe a little bit.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.080]   And the important thing is that we managed to get Conan O'Brien
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.960]   and his relaunched show somewhere inside the show
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.920]   so that we can show our support for Team Coco.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.000]   Team Coco.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.120]   Team Coco.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   Word.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.280]   The point being that it's exciting because this
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.040]   is the first phone since the iPhone that's not either a clone
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.640]   of the iPhone or either a--
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.880]   oh, so we should do a phone.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.760]   That's kind of-- that's the direction we should go in.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.120]   Because mostly, there have been a lot of lame copies going on.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   This is the first time where there's
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.960]   a brand new perspective, something that
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.760]   seems very, very relevant to the way
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.400]   that people use phones today.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.640]   It doesn't seem as app-driven, like as destination app-driven
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.720]   as the iPhone or as the Android.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.040]   But it seems to be the methodology of this interface.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.360]   Seems to be a lot more towards the--
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.880]   I'm going to take my phone out of my pocket.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.280]   I'm going to get a piece of information.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.440]   I'm going to put that phone back in my pocket
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.040]   because it makes it so easy to have multiple tiles of information,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.560]   multiple apps that can get your attention at the same time.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   If you just want to see--
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.640]   we just want to check email.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.440]   Just want to check Twitter.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.080]   Just want to see what the latest track is.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.760]   And put anything on that screen that you
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.560]   need to have a quick reference at.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.080]   This is really optimized towards that.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.200]   And it's a very, very pretty interface too.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   Apple can really take a couple lessons from here.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.680]   It's a very, very pretty ambitious interface.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.560]   It's pretty clear Microsoft sees it the same way
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920]   you've seen perhaps the season of the witch ad.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.320]   I'll play a little bit of it.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.480]   This-- using some great doors music.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.680]   It's a people--
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.200]   people-- is that the doors or--
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.280]   That would be Donovan.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   Donovan.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   Thank you for correcting me on that stupid mistake.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.640]   Yes, this is Microsoft's vision of the future.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.680]   Millions of people, no one looking at each other.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.200]   Nobody's looking at their phone.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.280]   At first, I thought, boy, did they get this run?
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.120]   Then he realized that everybody's staring at their iPhone
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.960]   and they're all sorts of accidents having occurred.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.440]   Including Guy fell off his bike.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.640]   There's the apples falling from the fruit stand.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.480]   And finally, it ends with a car running to a street lamp.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.000]   And you realize that what they're really saying is--
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.960]   I'm not sure this is a good ad for Windows Phone,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.280]   but they say it's time for a phone to save us from our phones.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.040]   And the point really is that with Windows Phone,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.840]   you get in, you get what you want, and you get out.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.760]   So that's kind of an interesting pitch.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.320]   Chris Breen, what do you think?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.080]   I think that is an interesting pitch,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.640]   because you could play that a couple of her ways.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.720]   And one is that--
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.200]   I think they might be addressing the fact that apples
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.680]   is what we have 250,000 apps and more, which is fine,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.040]   unless you've got a bunch of them on your phone
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.200]   and you're trying to do something,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   and you're constantly switching here,
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.640]   and you're going back there.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   And you just have so much stuff that, yes,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.720]   you do tend to have your face on the phone.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.480]   On the other hand, the message can also
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.000]   be if one were to look at it that way,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.920]   that this phone isn't very interesting,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.160]   and there's not much to look at.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.080]   And so what you really need to do is go, yeah, I'll tell you,
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.840]   oh, I've got Twitter.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.000]   Oh, well, I don't want to do anything else with this phone.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.400]   So I'll just put it back in my pocket.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.200]   So it's possible that the iPhone is really compelling,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.280]   and people spend so much time looking at it,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   or an Android phone, because there's so much going on,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.360]   and they're so interested in it.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   Where is Microsoft on the phone?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.920]   Yeah, I got--
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.400]   OK.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.640]   I have to ask, who is that at Aimed, Adam?
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.360]   Is there anybody who's buying a phone who doesn't want
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.520]   to be engaged by their phone?
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.360]   Your parents, it's being sold to parents who's saying,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.160]   get your face out of the phone.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.800]   I want to have a conversation with you.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.400]   You're kids today.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.880]   Yeah, so they'll get them a Windows phone,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.080]   and they could have gone, oh, yeah, a lot.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.960]   Well, I'm going to get one.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.360]   I'm sure Andy, have you got a review unit yet, or are you still?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.080]   I'm still in process.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.240]   I expect to get one well before the release date,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.880]   but I don't have one yet.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.040]   And I'm always reluctant to review a phone based even
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.400]   on just a few days, let alone no days experienced with it.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.280]   I think you really have to try it for at least a couple
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.480]   of weeks to really get a set.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.080]   You know, live with it.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.480]   Force yourself to live with it.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.840]   But one thing struck me immediately,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.240]   and you kind of raised this, whereas Apple and Android,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.400]   which really is an Apple clone in the respect
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.680]   that you were talking about, Andy, are very app-centric.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.360]   The OS takes a backseat to the apps.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.000]   The UI, for the most part that you live in, is an app, not
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.480]   so much the phone.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.160]   This, Microsoft taking exactly the opposite point of view,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.080]   maybe because they only have a couple of thousand apps.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.840]   But I think really that they're rethinking this,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.120]   and they're saying, we're going to be OS-centric.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.520]   They say it's your data-centric, but really,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.840]   it's always your data-centric.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.680]   What it really is is OS-centric.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.640]   We're going to deliver it your way.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.680]   And I think the success of this phone is absolutely
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.040]   going to rely on how well people take to this way of doing it,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.520]   because you really don't have a choice.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.440]   You've got the tiles, you've got the slities, the metros.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.360]   It's that or nothing, because apps don't take over the phone
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.240]   in the same way they do on Android.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.640]   And I think it's going to be a really good test case,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.320]   because so many companies, Apple included,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.080]   try to think that, well, we've got 400 million apps,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.000]   and that makes us better, because 400 million
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   is a larger number than 80,000, which
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.000]   is how many apps our competitor has.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.240]   But it's going to be a really good test
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.920]   to see how many of these third-party apps do people really
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.480]   rely on.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.320]   Do you really need to have a huge app store,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.920]   or is it enough that you cover eight, nine, maybe
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.160]   a dozen specific bases that people are looking to go for?
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.680]   If people got their Facebook cover, their Twitter covered,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.040]   ability to get email on the web, and the ability to maybe
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.640]   access cloud documents and Google documents on the run,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.600]   does it really matter to them that they
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.800]   don't have 800 different flashlight-fired apps?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.840]   It's my guess that Microsoft--
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.640]   I could just see the decision-making process, which
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.800]   is, can we ever compete with the app store?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.760]   No.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   Right.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.480]   I think that's the smartest move they may.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.840]   They decided to-- the only way you can compete with the iPhone
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.760]   and even with the Android is not to compete,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.520]   do something new, differentiate yourself in such a specific way
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.280]   that people will attract attention.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.320]   You won't just be buried in the scrum.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.880]   Here's another Windows phone ad just
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.920]   to give you an idea of where Microsoft's positioning
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.280]   is fun.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.960]   They're all looking at their phones this time.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:52.120]   Uh-huh.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.440]   She's giving a massage while looking at the phone.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.120]   He's pouring his coffee out.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.320]   The guys on the seesaw, the poor kids in the air.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.320]   There's a beautiful woman.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.680]   He's looking at his phone.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.040]   She's going on the roller coaster.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   He's looking at his phone.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.320]   A shark is coming.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.520]   He's looking at his phone.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.480]   He's in the urinal.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.560]   And he drops his phone.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.240]   Really?
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.920]   OK, I got to say, I like this ad.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   It looks like they're looking at a blackberry, by the way,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.640]   in every case.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.120]   Doesn't it?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.880]   Doesn't look like an iPhone or an Android phone.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.360]   It really looks like a blackberry.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.200]   They're all scrolling.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.240]   Really?
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   Really?
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.640]   It's for a phone to save us from our phone.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.880]   It's on to save us from our phone.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.400]   I think that's a really interesting pitch.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.360]   And out and back to life.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.080]   Get you in and back to life.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.960]   It's an interesting flip on the whole Mac versus PC thing.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.040]   Because in the past, everybody was saying, well, you get a PC
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.400]   because there are trillion applications for it.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.280]   And look at the Mac.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.880]   There are only a handful of them.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.440]   And Mac users would always say, yes, but they're all the write apps.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.120]   I can do everything I need to do in a more elegant way
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.480]   and a simpler way on my Mac than I can on a PC
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.760]   because on a PC I'm overwhelmed with stuff.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.680]   And now Microsoft has flipped that around.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.320]   Well, it goes even farther than that.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.760]   Because the Mac was always the computer for people
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.080]   who just wanted to get stuff done and get in and get out
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.880]   and not didn't want to fuss with it.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.560]   And this is exactly the opposite.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.880]   So I think it's great that Microsoft has turned the tables.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.640]   However, I have to say, I think it's going upstream.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.480]   And I really--
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.120]   I'm not convinced, to be honest, that this
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.000]   is going to be a successful strategy.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.520]   I really think it's going to come down
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.040]   to how people feel about those tiles.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.840]   And I think in the-- because I don't think you can--
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.280]   I mean, you're in the tiles, man.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.360]   This is it.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.560]   And I think--
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.440]   No, not really.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.600]   I mean, as soon as you tap a tile, you get into a big--
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.920]   a really nice horizontally scrolling interface
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   where it's on one level, it's the same sort of drill deeper
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.920]   as you go through menu, menu, menu, drill deep, drill deep,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.840]   drill deep.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.160]   But there's enough of a twist on that concept
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.240]   that it does give you a natural idea of the flow of where
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.080]   you are, where you're going, and how to get back
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.960]   to that first main screen.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.360]   The big idea is that all these tiles
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   are active, live, and interactive.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.720]   So it's not just that you get one little badge that says,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.240]   oh, you have 412 emails.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.760]   Do not tap me unless you want to get lost in work.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.960]   It can actually be giving you presenting information.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.560]   Just like, if those of you who do want
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.080]   to maximize the 90 seconds you're spending waiting in line
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.880]   at the post office, you take out the Windows 7 phone,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.120]   you glance at it on the screen, you
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.720]   find out what's going on in Twitter
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.680]   with the latest sports score is.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.520]   You find out that with a subject line of your last email
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.440]   is what the location of your next appointment is going to be,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.120]   whether your flight's been delayed.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.520]   Not that you would want to look at eight tiles at once,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.640]   but it saves you from an additional tap
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.800]   to launch-- in my case, trip it just to find out,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.520]   is my plane on time or not.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.720]   You're saying it's dashboard focused?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.560]   It's dashboard-- well, yeah, it's a nice centralized dashboard.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.240]   But even when you get into apps, the UI is very distinctive.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.280]   I mean, you know you're using RITO's phone the whole time.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.920]   It seems to be.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.960]   But that's a good thing.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.320]   It's such a unique interface where the best way to put it
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.600]   is that it's very, very focused on transitions and camera moves.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.720]   So as you are drilling deeper, it's
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.280]   such a simple idea where you can either have a little ellipsis
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.040]   sort of thing where an arrow pointing to the other direction
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.320]   saying, over here, you have a list of active mentions
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.120]   on Twitter.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.840]   Or you can simply make the title
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.520]   pane of the previous screen a little too wide.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.960]   So it's actually still encroaching into the next screen
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.120]   so that mentally you look at that and you realize, oh,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.720]   right, that's right.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.960]   That's the ONS of mentions.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.800]   So if I tap that, that'll take me back to the mentions page.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.920]   I'll just-- the camera will move one step to the left,
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.560]   and you'll be back for you before.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.840]   I've used it on-- I got the first really positive review
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.280]   of the Zoom last year when the Zoom HD came out.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.880]   And it was based on-- and I know the Windows 7 phone
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   is based a lot on the same UI stuff that the Zoom came out with.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.480]   And I was pretty happy with the interface on the Zoom.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.840]   Well, if you like the Zoom, you'll like this.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.920]   This is the Zoom phone.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.280]   It's flashy and it's very, very functional.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.120]   Again, it's a beautiful user interface device design.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.560]   I don't know how practical it's going to be.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.360]   I don't know how functional it will be in practice.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.480]   We have to try it.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.880]   I've had all of this kind of--
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.400]   How cool it's going to be.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.480]   There's a coolness factor with Microsoft.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.720]   When people look at Microsoft, they think of going
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   on the seven food groups ride at Disneyland.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.560]   And I go, oh, there is such a thing.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   Oh, well, all right.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.760]   Well, I'm going to have to go on that right there.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.440]   So Microsoft has sort of an uphill battle
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.200]   because there's already iPhone and Android, which people
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.720]   tend to think in twos anyway.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.360]   And now you've got this other option.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.000]   And people think, as they do with the Zoom,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.520]   although I think the Zoom in its current form is great,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.680]   they look at this-- yeah, but it's Microsoft.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.240]   So do I really want to do that?
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.400]   Well, it's a horse race.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.480]   Let's put it that way.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.160]   We just don't know how many horses.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:57.120]   It's obviously Apple, Google, and probably Blackberry.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.440]   You've got to worry about Nokia, which has 41%
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.240]   of the smartphone market worldwide, but dwindling fast.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   Yeah, that's like the percentage of the Earth
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.600]   that the British Empire had in 1946.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.200]   No 1946.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   Good number.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.240]   Enjoy that number.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.280]   It's going to be trending.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.480]   The adult city is going to be negative for the Nexus.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.400]   Press the little girls.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.000]   The trend is not your friend.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.120]   You might be able to hold on to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.360]   if you're lucky.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.160]   We're going to-- did you see Woz on--
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.120]   Of course you did, because you watch Big Bang Theory religiously.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:27.960]   Yep.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.360]   Woz and Mrs. Woz.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.000]   And Mrs. Woz.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.720]   Janet was on, too.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.280]   I guess she smiled and nodded quite nicely.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.680]   I'll tell you what, I probably will get this show removed.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.920]   If I haven't already, by playing Microsoft ads,
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.440]   I don't know, from YouTube.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.600]   Anytime we play copyrighted material, YouTube just says,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.080]   "Ah, you didn't want to show that, did you?"
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.040]   Well, that's OK.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.920]   Then we can talk about how clueless Microsoft is
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   for prohibiting us from giving them free ad play.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   Well, let's see how the Big Bang Theory folks feel.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.200]   I'm going to play that as well.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.280]   So one more shot at copyright violation in a minute.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.800]   And then we'll talk about something very exciting having
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.560]   to do with Woz and this network.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.480]   But first, I want to talk a little bit about go to my PC.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.920]   Boy, they are a great company.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.400]   These Citrix folks, they're really the kings of remote access.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.160]   And now access to your PC or your Mac anywhere, anytime,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.120]   from go to my PC.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.560]   Here's how it works.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.480]   First, you go to the PC or Mac you want to remotely access.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.200]   In your web browser, you surf over to go to my PC.com.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.280]   You sign up for the free trial.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.040]   Use the offer code Macbrake so we get some credit for that.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.800]   You click download.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.200]   It's about a 30 second download.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.120]   I mean, depends on your bandwidth, but it is fast.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.800]   And then you're done.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.480]   Now you're set up.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.960]   That computer is accessible from anywhere,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.720]   from any kind of computer, Mac or PC.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.040]   So you don't even have to use the same kind of computer
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.600]   to access that computer.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.200]   You go to any other computer on the net,
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.800]   whether you're traveling, whether you're at home.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.760]   You open up your browser.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.920]   You go to the website.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.400]   Once again, go to my PC.com.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.160]   You enter your secure username and password.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.280]   And boom, there it is.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.880]   That Mac or PC accessed full speed.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.400]   You could do anything you'd want to do with a run any program.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.000]   Check email, send email.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.920]   Fool everybody.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.800]   They'll think you're at work when you're not.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.360]   Access network resources.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.720]   It's that easy to use.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.240]   I love it.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:24.960]   It's fast.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.080]   It's efficient.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.800]   It's effective.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.400]   And I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.600]   If you're planning a trip in the near future,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.800]   go to my PCs and must have.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.840]   Before you leave, put it on your computer.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.000]   You'll be glad you did.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.040]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C dot com.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.400]   And the offer code is Macbreak.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.160]   Give it a try today.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.520]   Go to my PC dot com.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.880]   Offer code Macbreak.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.080]   I think you're going to love it.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.200]   All right, folks.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.120]   Some very good news.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.000]   Mr. Wozniak is going to be on--
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.360]   we're going to start--
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.200]   we're following in Bloomberg's footsteps.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.520]   Bloomberg's doing a thing.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.560]   They call them game changes.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.640]   They're interviewing all the big names.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.240]   I think Zuckerberg's going to be on--
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.320]   Steve Jobs is going to be on, I think, soon.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.400]   And I wish we could do such a thing.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.840]   But we couldn't get jobs, but we got Woz.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.080]   So Steve Woz on Wednesday.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.760]   This day, tomorrow, right?
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.960]   Tomorrow.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.920]   Yes, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern, Tom, Merritt,
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.880]   and I are going to spend some time with Woz asking your question.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.360]   In fact, if you've got a question you'd
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.200]   like to have us ask Woz, please do Twitter it.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.360]   I guess let's make the Twitter hashtag--
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   which we-- Woz on Twitter.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.560]   OK, Eileen, Woz, W-O-Z-O-N-T-W-I-T.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.840]   We'll look for your hashtags.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.040]   You can put your questions Woz on Twitter.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.640]   And then that way we'll know to look for it.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.400]   But here he is.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.760]   See, he's such a superstar.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.880]   He was on Dancing With The Stars.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.320]   And here he is on the show--
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.840]   Big Bang Theory.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.920]   Manager.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.440]   Oh, Lord.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.680]   Look who it is.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.200]   So what's the name of this character?
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.080]   He's a remote telepresence.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.840]   No, this is Sheldon Cooper.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   Sheldon.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.760]   And he's at a coffee shop.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760]   But he's not really there.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.080]   He's there via telepresence.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.920]   He's built himself a telepresence-- like telepresence
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.960]   remote droid so that he can live forever and not
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   have to be exposed to germs or injury.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.560]   But now he's going to learn an important life lesson,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   like, about why we're supposed to be out there in the real world.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.840]   So he sees Woz and Janet, Woz and Mrs. Woz,
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.280]   and goes over in his telepresence robot.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   You know, there's an olive garden down the street.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.080]   You guys should try it sometime.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.800]   She's not real happy.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.320]   Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.080]   Oh, hey.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.000]   Nice virtual presence device.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.840]   Thank you.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.560]   I just want to say I'm a big fan.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   You're my 15th favorite technological visionary.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.600]   Only 15th?
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.960]   It's still six spots above Steve Jobs.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.800]   So who are 1 through 14?
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.120]   That's what I'm really wondering.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.240]   Number one is himself.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.720]   I'm betting.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.400]   And it's like we're two, three, and four.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.520]   So we're in there.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.880]   It's nice that Janet got a little--
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.400]   I care about it for Turtle Next, nor showmanship.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.080]   Little shot at--
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.560]   I never got that turtle like thing.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.320]   Little shot at Jobs there.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.000]   Obviously that was written into the script,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.080]   but Woz isn't good.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.160]   Woz will say anything.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.800]   You know, you put it in front of him.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.760]   He's got his-- by the way, he's got his nixie watch.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.400]   See, he's wearing his nixie watch on there.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.840]   And a catch up with the wine, which I think is very Woz-like.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.760]   Let's--
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.200]   One of my proudest possessions.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.560]   That's Janet, by the way, Janet Wozniak.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.440]   We know Annie and I know because we've cruised with her.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   There we go.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.360]   On a ship.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.640]   Yeah, not down Petaluma Boulevard, nor is on a ship.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.080]   She--
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.200]   On a lowrider note.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.080]   I don't know if she still does.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.000]   She worked for Apple Education for a long time.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.440]   And as a great person, and that's--
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.360]   Still works with Apple, I believe.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.920]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   And worked and of course went on
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.640]   to many of the Mac Mania cruises.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.160]   Bins is a vintage 19--
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.240]   As did Woz, by the way.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.040]   I've cruised with Woz a couple of times.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.920]   B7, Apple II.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.480]   Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3,
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.880]   it was a pretty nifty little achievement.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.360]   Thanks.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.000]   We were shooting for nifty.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.840]   You know, if you hadn't here, I'd autograph it for you.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.880]   Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.120]   depending on how the buses are running.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.040]   So Sheldon was golfed to get his vintage nerds.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.960]   Oh, I guess she doesn't get aligned, does she?
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   They'd have to pay her then.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.080]   So he runs off to get his vintage Apple II.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.960]   That is clearly an Apple IIe, which you can tell
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.920]   by the back of the bus.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.840]   Sheldon could have been a burning produce, which
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.400]   had a much, much better process.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.080]   It is a IIe.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.600]   That's why this episode didn't work for me.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.680]   Yeah, well, it's like the Zuckerberg movie.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.520]   You know, when they get it wrong,
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.040]   it just spoils the whole thing.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.800]   Just as easy to get it right as it gets it wrong.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.600]   I'm producers.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.960]   I'll tell you what, so that we won't--
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.440]   we won't-- no spoilers.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   But Sheldon, as you said, learns a valuable lesson.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.840]   You have to watch that episode of Big Bang Theory, which
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.800]   was on a couple of weeks ago.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.040]   And I hope you will tune in to watch
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   Woz on our show tomorrow, on our special.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   We're going to start-- we've got John Perry Barlow.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.600]   We're going to start interviewing, I think, big names,
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   just like Bloomberg's doing.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.800]   So Jobs will be on Bloomberg television this week,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.040]   talking about his days as a college dropout.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.960]   Seriously.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.160]   Those that he can remember.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.640]   If he can remember any of it.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.600]   At Reed, I think he was.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.160]   One of 11 episodes of Bloomberg plans to air--
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.840]   now through January 2011, as part of its documentary series,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.800]   Bloomberg, Game Changers, Zuckerberg, Sergey and Larry
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.440]   from Google, Biz, Stone, and Evan Williams at Twitter.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.640]   Well, they moved up in the world.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   Larry Ellison will be on.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:56.560]   I think there's a clip.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.280]   I mean, we're going to get blocked on YouTube anyway.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.240]   Am I as well just--
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.720]   Let's just go for it.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.800]   Let's just show Star Wars Episode 4.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.040]   Let's just go all the way.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   That doesn't look like Jobs.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.320]   Maybe they made a mistake.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.200]   I don't know.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.920]   Steve Jobs does not care what you think.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.040]   This is a gutsy guy.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.760]   He's the greatest turn around in the history of corporate America.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.960]   In business, you're used to a lot of give and take.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.200]   That's not Apple's way.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.240]   He's transformed the world we live in.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   How does he do it?
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.600]   He's a showman who can really introduce a product.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.400]   And he has great products.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.280]   Oh, it's Guy.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.920]   It wasn't a gold farmer in Afghanistan
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.800]   that hadn't heard about the iPhone.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.040]   Like Thursday at night.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.480]   Can you say the effing iPhone?
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.400]   Wow.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.840]   Bloomberg's getting itchy.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.120]   So I'll watch that.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.720]   That'll be interesting.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.840]   So they can't complain about that.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.880]   That was a promo.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.400]   They didn't even have any, Steve, in there.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   All right, the official iPhone rumor segment now of the show.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.160]   We do this every week.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.120]   I think we talked last week about the Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.440]   And the iPhone, did we not, Andy?
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.320]   I believe we did.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.600]   I believe we did.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.640]   Anything new about that?
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.720]   Anything to deny?
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.120]   Cuz, Preen, do you believe that a Verizon will get iPhone in 2011?
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.640]   Well, gosh, if the Wall Street Journal says so,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.280]   and then the New York Times says,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.000]   "The Wall Street Journal's right."
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.520]   Then it must be true, huh?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.920]   It must be true.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.520]   And why not?
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.480]   I think we've all been waiting for this for a really long time.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.160]   It makes a lot of sense when we see the Android share going up
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.880]   as much as it is.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   It would be lovely for those people who say,
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.240]   "I'd like to get an iPhone, but I can't because I'm stuck with Verizon
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.080]   or I don't like AT&T or I love Verizon.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.000]   Now those people finally have an option."
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.280]   And I have to think that really, truly this time, early 2011, we see it.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.640]   I guess the question everybody is asking is,
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.240]   "Well, how much does Apple concede to Verizon?
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.040]   Do we get Verizon apps on the iPhone?
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.520]   Do we get VCAST locked in as we do on other Verizon apps?"
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.040]   I hope that we have like three NASCAR apps on the front page
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.560]   and we could make eight button taps to the camera app.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   That would be good.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.920]   It's the Verizon innovation that we're missing.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.720]   It's the way, the Verizon way.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.960]   Now, there are other rumors.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.080]   TechCrunch, of course, didn't want to be left behind with the times
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   and the journal in this.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.400]   They've got to come up with something new.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.320]   So TechCrunch says, "The phone will be a dual radio phone with GSM
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.840]   and CDMA," which I'd like to see because Verizon CDMA does not work
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.920]   outside the US and some limited North American country.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.880]   So if you travel, it's nice to have a world phone.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.000]   But they say, and I'm hearing this from other places as well,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.720]   will not support 4G, the LTE network that Verizon is rolling out,
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.360]   has announced it's rolling out.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.880]   In time for this phone, I mean, they're going to have it in Silicon Valley,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.840]   they say this year.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   Thoughts?
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.640]   Is that credible, a dual band phone without LTE?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.400]   Well, a dual band certainly makes sense for Apple
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.600]   in terms of their manufacturing.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.440]   Why make two different flavors of phone if you don't have to,
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.280]   if they can do a dual-band phone?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.720]   And this would be the iPhone 5, right?
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.680]   I mean, it would be--
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.400]   Right, yeah.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.000]   It'd be a new phone.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.200]   And then, you know, they still have a strong relationship with AT&T
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.920]   and maybe AT&T is still going to talk to them about what they're going
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.400]   to do with 4G, and maybe it's going to take them a little longer.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.320]   And maybe they don't want to have this built into the phone
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.440]   and then have AT&T customers say, yeah, but I can't use that.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.240]   Yeah, but you've got to think Steve Jobs is watching the Windows
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.040]   phone launch with Ralph de La Vega, CEO of AT&T Front and Center.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.560]   In fact, he even said something like, we're really happy to have
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.960]   the best smartphones on the AT&T network.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.760]   You know, you have to think that this is Ralph saying, OK,
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.080]   Apple, you're going to leave us, but you're not going to leave us alone.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.280]   And this would be the first strange moment those two have ever had
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   in their relationships.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.960]   So I see this could be grounds for a breakup.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.760]   It is certainly strained.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.440]   No, that certainly has before.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.280]   I was being facetious with it.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.320]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm right.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:54.840]   OK.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.360]   I mean, Steve falls them all together.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.960]   I know.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.560]   What's going on here?
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.960]   So for him to go out on stage and say, yes, this is the best phone ever.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.800]   It's sure it's for you to think, though, this is a real opportunity
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:11.960]   for we iPhone 4 users to find out if the problem is AT&T or iPhone 4.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.480]   Because I'm going to get--
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.640]   I hate to do it, but I think I have to get an AT&T Windows Phone 7.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.440]   I don't hate to do it because of Windows Phone 7.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.240]   I hate to do it because of AT&T.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.640]   Even my son is--
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.800]   now, by the way, my son is not propagandized, does not follow this.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.640]   And even he, last night, said, boy, you know, half the calls
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.840]   I make on my iPhone 4.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.680]   What's going on, Dad?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.120]   Is it broken?
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.040]   He did not-- he'd never heard any of these stories.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.240]   He's not into this stuff.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.120]   But even he completely independently is saying, it's not a good phone.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.160]   I mean, Apple just hates problems that they can't solve themselves.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.920]   And AT&T, just whatever the actual problem is, is not a problem
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.640]   that they can solve directly.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.800]   I was at the-- again, New York Comic Con over the weekend.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.400]   It was just the absolute dead zone for coverage.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.280]   You could not make phone calls.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   You could not tweet.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.640]   You could not get access to it with your iPad worth anything.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.960]   And so really, it was--
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.720]   I'm going to have to think about every single interesting and amusing thing
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.320]   I could possibly say at a Comic Con.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.080]   And make sure I do that from my hotel room before I leave for the Con
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.480]   for-- because of the Javits Center, AT&T was just a big smoke and crater.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.000]   So Apple could quit very quickly offload, I think, 40% of their PR problems,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.200]   just by simply making sure that it's available on multiple carriers
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.680]   so that people start blaming the carrier.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.120]   So inevitably, whoever has a Verizon phone and gets bad service
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.000]   will say, oh, stupid Verizon, I wish I had AT&T and vice versa for the AT&T users.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.520]   Well, it could go both ways for Apple.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.200]   That could be the case.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.440]   Or the Windows phone could work great on AT&T.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.400]   And then Apple gets to say, well, we didn't want to say it.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.160]   But the problem-- actually, it would be the other way around.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.720]   AT&T would say, we didn't want to say it, but the problem was Apple.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.800]   Or it goes the other way.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.360]   And then Apple says, well, we didn't want to say it.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   The problem was AT&T.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.040]   I think November 8th.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.760]   We're going to learn a lot about who's really--
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   Oh, so that's a shame.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760]   Hopefully.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.240]   I think in Microsoft's wildest dreams, they will sell enough Windows 7 phones
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.280]   that network overload is going to be a problem.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.480]   Well, no, they're all using the same.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.000]   They're all using the same 3G.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   So if you're in San Francisco with a Windows Phone 7,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.600]   you're using the same exact network that the iPhone 4 folks have complained about
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.080]   for three years.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.200]   Or actually, the iPhone users-- and now the iPhone 4 users complain about.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.680]   If you don't have the same problems on Windows Phone 7 in San Francisco,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.280]   presumably then that indicts the phone, doesn't it?
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.200]   Yeah, it certainly does.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.400]   And you have-- I mean, a lot of what people are saying about San Francisco in particular,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.800]   and I don't know if this is the situation in San Francisco or in New York.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.680]   But it's a matter of having enough towers that San Francisco-- I've talked to a few
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   AT&T people-- and I said, we would love to just sprinkle towers all over that darn city.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.160]   But, you know, and Leo, as you know, living around here, it's hard to get stuff done in
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   San Francisco.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.920]   They have many towers here, us.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.840]   Yeah, even if you make them look like trees, they don't look like the trees we have.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.520]   And so, no, you can't do that.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.320]   And so I could certainly understand AT&T's frustration that they do want to build up
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   the infrastructure.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.880]   But the government is saying, yeah, well, it's going to be a three-year wait before you
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.680]   can do anything in our town.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.400]   I want your opinion on this, because I think I may have made a mistake-- a little bit of
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.320]   a mistake on a Twit this Sunday.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:29.640]   We had Ryan Block on, Ryan posted this week a big blog post saying there's something-- there's
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.320]   a real problem with the iPhone 4.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.600]   He called it Glassgate.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.040]   He said, Apple has dumped all the slip-on covers, of which I have one, from the Apple
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   Store.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:45.120]   You can't buy the slide-on covers anymore, because it turns out that this glass on the
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.680]   back is so prone to scratching, scoring, and eventually fracturing due to those scratches
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.280]   that a slide-on case-- that's why Apple sells a bumper case-- a slide-on case.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.960]   It could cause some real problems.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.720]   He says it's a severe problem that Apple's taking extremely seriously.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.000]   Linkbait, or is there really a problem?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Gee, I don't know.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.400]   I haven't seen a problem like that.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.120]   My main area of curiosity was whether the backplate was more prone to fracture than
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.280]   the frontplate.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.720]   And if that might not have been an engineering decision, so that if force has to be transmitted
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.400]   from that rigid frame to something, better to make it a $29 easily genius bar replaceable
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.280]   part than a $100 part that needs to-- that's best to swap out to do.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:36.240]   I bought this-- I-Frog's case at the AT&T store has a little velveteen on the inside.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   But the idea is even a case like this, which Apple apparently no longer sells, would score
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   the back.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.040]   And once scored, the phone would be more prone to cracking.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   I haven't had any problem.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   I haven't been using this for a while.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.760]   Andy, I really do need some proof before I'll subtract that.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.720]   If it weren't Ryan, I love Ryan, and trust him so much that I really believe that he
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.200]   is not the kind of guy who would go for the linkbait.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.120]   But then subsequent, I got a lot of email from people saying, "Where is the evidence?
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.680]   What's going on?"
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.880]   This sounds like a story to generate traffic, not a real crisis in the iPhone.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.440]   Have you, Chris, heard anything at all about this?
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.160]   I haven't seen any evidence of this, and I did read the post.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.920]   And I thought the post was quite well done.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:24.000]   Although I question the wisdom of putting gate in anything, unless there's a real serious
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   problem.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.080]   I don't think Ryan was around when the first gate happened, which was Watergate.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.840]   But that was a serious cover-up, big problem.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.000]   And maybe Apple is concerned about this, and maybe there is something going on, but I'm
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.320]   not sensing that there is a serious cover-up of anything going on.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.120]   I think that we would have seen people saying, "Look, here's the photograph.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.080]   There's evidence that I've got scratches here."
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.880]   And look, it's shattered because of this.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.520]   I looked at this series of comments in his post, and there were a few people who said,
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.400]   "Yes, mine shattered.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.400]   What happened?"
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   Well, I dropped it.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.640]   That's not the same thing, exactly.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.000]   And that doesn't really merit a gate unless it's clumsy gate.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.240]   And you swear that you didn't drop it.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.880]   And then that definitely is a gate.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.200]   All right, we won't call it gate.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.480]   And I will say the jury is still out.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.320]   But I do think it's somewhat telling that Apple pulled these slide-on cases.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.000]   And I have to say, I bought a slide-on case.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.440]   I gave Henry my bumper case.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.720]   He had a slide-on mophie case.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.880]   I said, "Take this instead."
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.840]   And we'll just have to-- I don't know.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840]   We'll wait and see.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   But I haven't had any problem.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.720]   On the other hand, this iPhone doesn't really get out much.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.160]   So it may not be this particular iPhone may not be a good example.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.200]   I thought I'd bring it up, give you guys a chance to weigh in.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.120]   More to come in just a little bit.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.560]   We are talking with Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.840]   And the Sérez Judo waist of Badenwet.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.200]   And obviously, a sad Red Sox fan today.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.880]   No, I'm a great Red Sox fan because I'm a fan of the greatest team in baseball,
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.800]   the Boston Red Sox.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:06.680]   See, we don't get-- we get our pleasure from the game, the sport, the ballpark,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.200]   the integrity of our players.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:13.440]   We don't need that ego boost of postseason play to make ourselves feel good about ourselves
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.440]   and our teams.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.960]   Let that other team keep writing those checks, just write the check, write the check, write
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   the check.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.200]   Maybe that'll fill that Yankee-sized hole in your heart where your heart would be if
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.960]   you were not a Yankees fan.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.520]   It will never work.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   But I eat the only pity them.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   They have the money.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.360]   I'm rooting for a Yankees giant.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.960]   I know this is the farthest fetch thing in the world.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   I'm rooting for a Yankees giant's World Series.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.240]   So I can root against the Yankees with you.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   Exactly.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.800]   Also here Chris Breen, the pouffant of all knowledge is Twitter account.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   He actually is too.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.520]   He has hair of Breen and body of Breen.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.000]   Do you do both of those or somebody else?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   No, I don't.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Hair of Breen is somebody else.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.240]   But you acknowledged hair of Breen by having your Twitter account be body of Breen.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   Well, I had to.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   It was a natural reaction.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.040]   I thought, well, if my hair is going to have an account, I need to do something as well.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.400]   And I would be wearing my giant's hat because I'm now a reborn giant.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.400]   Me too.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.920]   Smush the sound.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   Classy giants too.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920]   Yes.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.400]   Bobby Cox stopping applause.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.720]   That was a classy move.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.960]   It almost looked like Bruce Batchy was trying to run over and shake Bobby's hand.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   I think he was and Bobby just had to go.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.760]   I think he was choked up.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   You know what?
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760]   That's what it was.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760]   I really think that's what it was.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.920]   I think he did not want to cry in public and at the press conference, he did in fact
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   lose it.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.920]   He did.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   And that was that was so touching.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.840]   And when he was talking about his team, I just thought, I'm sorry.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.440]   I didn't mean this to go to be.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.640]   Well, no, it's hard for me.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.920]   It was a fall, but it was classy.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.560]   As a giants fan for years, and we have often faced the Braves in clutch situations and rooted
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560]   against the Braves.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:47.960]   And I remember the days of Smolts and really hating the Braves.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.200]   But Bobby Cox was always there.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.920]   And so you got to tip your hat to a great competitor and obviously one of the Hall of
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.880]   Fame manager, best managers in baseball.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   But it was a good night last night for giants fans.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.640]   Let's leave it at that.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.080]   And I bring it on, fillies.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   So you're right.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.760]   I don't know how that happened.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.840]   We got into that.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:14.640]   Let's talk about something everybody can root for the little, the little fighting machine
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.080]   from data robotics that we call the Drobo.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   You got to love the Drobo.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.960]   Everybody loves a Drobo.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.560]   I pull all my stuff in a Drobo.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.000]   But all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.360]   I've got the new Drobo FS.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.760]   Actually, there's a newer Drobo.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:35.000]   If you go to Drobo.com/Macbreak, you can learn all about the various Drobo models.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.200]   They now have a Drobo Pro FS, which, you know, compared to my Drobo FS, looks like there's
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   something wrong with it.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.200]   It's like it's got stretched.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.360]   Look at the size of that thing.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.880]   That's because it's got eight count them, eight drives.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.960]   It's like a double neck guitar.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.560]   It just has to be more awesome.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.800]   It is twice as awesome.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   Twice as awesome.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.960]   You can see what all the Drobo units are.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.520]   You can also get a great deal, save up to $500 on a populated Drobo.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.840]   You know, it says Macbreak weekly on the website.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.080]   I've been told it's Macbreak.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.360]   I don't know.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   Try one of the others.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   See what you get.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.600]   You get you the better discount.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.560]   Oh, I tell you.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   Let me talk about the Drobo models though here.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.520]   You got your basic Drobo, which is the first to come out.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.600]   We were all so excited when Drobo came out.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.880]   For drives, for data redundancy and speed connects via USB 2 or Firewire 800.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.480]   A lot of photographers, people with videographers, people with big data storage needs went out
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.920]   and got the Drobo.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:43.680]   Drobo realized that there was a market here that came out with a Drobo S via eSATA Firewire
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.320]   800 or USB 2.0.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.000]   Five drives for more capacity up to 10 terabytes.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.600]   The Drobo FS, which I have in my house for backup network wide because it connects via
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.920]   a gigabit ethernet.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.320]   I just love having that redundancy.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   Any drive can fail.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.520]   Actually, you could set the Drobo FS for any two drives to fail.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.960]   You just pop them out, put a new one in, and it's back up and running without the loss
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   of any data.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.760]   Those lights on the front tell you exactly the drive status.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.720]   When one of the drives starts to fill up, pop the smallest drive, put a new one in, and
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.560]   you've got more capacity just like that.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.920]   The Drobo Pro with the eight drives.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.840]   The 16 terabytes of storage, nearline bulk storage is what they call it.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   Bulk up.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.920]   Of course, the Drobo Elite with its eye-scuzzy, its virtualization support, its a certified
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.160]   VMware client up to basically a say on 16 servers or workstations can connect at the
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.880]   same time.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.680]   They're great products.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.920]   Highly recommend for anybody who has to do a lot of storage.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   We all know about the Drobo.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.200]   I hope you know about the Drobo.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   If you don't, I want you to go to Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.160]   Drobo.com/macbreak and learn more.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.640]   I guess if you decide to buy it, use the code Mac.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.840]   That's what it says on the website, MacBreak Weekly.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.720]   You'll save $75 to $500 off a populated Drobo model.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.080]   Put all your stuff in a Drobo.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   We do.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.160]   We trust it with our most precious data.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.520]   I love that jingle.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.200]   I got two jingles for Drobo in play.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   This is another one.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   DROBODROBO.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   G-LEN DROBY.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   That's F-Smith.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.960]   G-LEN DROBY.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   Moving along.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   Let's see.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   More news for you.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   Apple trademarks.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   There's an app for that.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.040]   Well, of course they do.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.200]   It ought to be theirs.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.840]   And with other people coming along, I think they ought to own that, don't you?
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   Absolutely right.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.480]   Who came up with theirs and app for that?
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.280]   Was it Apple or was it the ads or was it somebody else saying it?
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.360]   No, I think that was an Apple thing.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.560]   And why would they let that go anymore than Campbell would give up?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   Mm-mm, good.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   Right.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.520]   We've talked about this before.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.680]   And I think I know what Andy's opinion of this, but I'd like to know what Chris's opinion
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.840]   of this.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.880]   It always looked like to me when they first came out with the iPhone, there were no apps.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.560]   And Steve Jobs really went on and on about how you really ought to do web apps.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.840]   That's the way to go.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.440]   You build your apps on the web and we'll support them.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.280]   And it's just like an app, but it's better.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.560]   And apparently the demand for apps was so great, they created the app store in just a
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   few months.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.800]   And by the time of year, I don't remember if it was the next iPhone that had apps or
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.440]   if they did it within just a few months of the release of the first iPhone, but they
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.760]   obviously apps have been huge.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.640]   It always struck me that Apple, and this happens in the industry, you can't predict
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.520]   until people start using your stuff, what they're going to want.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.360]   It seems to me that Apple didn't realize apps were going to be huge.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.200]   But once they figured that out, they sure run with it.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.120]   Do you think, I think Andy, you think that Apple knew ahead of time, it just, it was
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.440]   typical Steve, misdirection.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.600]   I think so.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.680]   I think that they did, this is speculation, but I do think that that app store ecosystem
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   was always part of the plan.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.920]   I do think that there are some serants and saying we have this really great system for
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:11.600]   building web apps, which will, which from their point of view will get added functionality
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.080]   out the door and will allow the iPhone to really start planning its flag in the world
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.280]   without having all the infrastructure for the app store set up yet.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.600]   I'm not sure that that was ever an intention for web apps to ever be on the same playing
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.120]   field as those things, but I think it's silly to think that they just saw that the trial
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.240]   balloon that they floated got shut down quickly, then they carried to put together some sort
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.480]   of third party third party app store.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.560]   There's still more to gain because you can sell stuff and get 30% off it.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   I'm sure Apple has billions.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.040]   Well, they're saying that at the shareholders meeting, they're still saying that it makes
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.760]   money, but not as much as you'd think that mostly the app store is there to sell more
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.640]   iPhones and make it more important in the marketplace.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.240]   That's how iTunes always has been.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.200]   It does make money on the music, but it does sell iPods.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   So Chris, what's your take on it?
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.520]   You think Apple knew that apps were going to be big and just slow played it?
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.560]   They slow played their hand is to use poker parlance.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.480]   I believe they did.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:13.080]   I think that Apple has enough money to afford a whiteboard and they use that whiteboard.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:20.200]   They ride at the top and they go down the whiteboard, or actually this way.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.240]   I think the idea that Apple is a very large ship.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.600]   It's the big tanker and the idea that suddenly they get the big stink on the web apps or
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.200]   not the kind of enthusiasm they want, particularly from developers, is that they're suddenly
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.440]   going, "Oh, well, let's do this."
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   And look, six months later, we have all the infrastructure set up for the apps.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.120]   She certainly is convenient that we happen to have this iTunes store thing that we've
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   already set up.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.680]   Maybe if we just rejigger that a little bit, no, I have to think that Apple has the whiteboard
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.800]   with years of plans on it.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.040]   Certainly they're going to vary from it as things change.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.440]   I want a picture of that whiteboard if you ever see it.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.120]   Wouldn't you love to have a picture of that?
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:07.400]   I think I would have to hone my ninja skills to the 75th level just to get to the fourth
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.360]   door away from that room.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:15.880]   That's a Tom Cruise mission and possible moment where he's hanging on the wires floating,
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.680]   snaps the whiteboard, pulls them back up.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.200]   But I'd love to get a picture of that road map, so would everybody else in the world.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.920]   It's always one of those things where it's obvious in hindsight that the app store was
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.880]   a great idea.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.800]   It's obvious that that was a competitive, complete competitive advantage over everybody
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   else.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.840]   It made everybody else have to play catch up and it took them years to do so.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.240]   That's why I think maybe Apple didn't know, but who knows?
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.160]   They're obviously smarter than I am.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.600]   Oh, don't tell me.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.520]   No, absolutely not.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.400]   I think I just bought my last computer, my last desktop computer.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.560]   I'm sure I'll buy more laptops.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   I'm sure I'll buy my iPhone.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.720]   You finally have been banned from every Best Buy and Apple store in our video.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.320]   Canada is so close by.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.160]   I decided I was playing...
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:12.200]   I bought the Mac Pro, the i7 Mac Pro because I thought, well, that will be my last desktop
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.760]   because it's an i7, but it's a laptop and so it's not that fast.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.680]   I've been playing Starcraft and I put it on the 27-inch monitor, which I...
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.920]   She says, "Sounds like I'm spending a lot of money here."
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.400]   I am, but it's all for Starcraft, so it's okay.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.600]   But when you get the 27-inch monitor and you get the big resolution and you try to run
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:37.880]   it off the laptop, the laptop labors, and I mean, you can hear it going...
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.080]   So I thought, well, I need a better computer to play and then I thought, maybe I'll buy
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.480]   a Windows computer because then I could play Civ 5 and there's some games that are still
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.000]   not on Macintosh, even though Steam is.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.520]   And then I thought, well, really, the best Windows computer is a Mac Pro.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.880]   So I decided I bought a Mac Pro.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.520]   I haven't told my boss this yet, but I bought the...
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.960]   I used the Twig credit card.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.240]   Is that okay?
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.240]   I bought the...
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   Honey?
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   Honey?
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.560]   I bought the 8-core...
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:14.800]   The middle one, not the 12-core, not the quad-core, but the dual Westmeers with 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.920]   And I'm thinking, as I'm buying it, this may be the last desktop I ever buy because...
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   Really, I can't...
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.000]   I mean, how much more power does one need?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Ever.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Don't you think?
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.120]   I mean, I'll probably buy more other devices like laptops.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.120]   But I just don't see myself...
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.680]   I mean, for 10 years, what are we going to do with a more powerful computer?
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.160]   What is it that we need?
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.680]   The next version of StarCraft.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.520]   Well, that took 10 years.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.000]   No, I'm sorry, Chris, you were about to say.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   No, I wasn't.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Okay.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.960]   I think that we're just going to need more powerful processors just to support more powerful
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.360]   user interfaces.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.360]   And until we get those...
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.700]   Those user interfaces and operating systems that just require more crunch power, then people
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.920]   are going to be surprised to see how little they can get by with.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.800]   The past few weeks were...
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.920]   The iPads final exam for me because it was the first two real trips that I've taken relying
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.840]   on the iPad as my sole computer.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.800]   I'm not talking about like, I'm going to be backpacking in Canyon Country.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.960]   I'll just maybe write a couple of notes myself.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.200]   No, I'm talking about actually researching, writing columns, driving presentations, creating
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   presentations.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.200]   We can put in the horsepower.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.160]   We can do it on an iPad for crying out loud.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   Exactly.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.600]   I mean, even at New York Comic-Con, Comic-Con was the real test because this was one where
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.160]   I was covering a...
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.160]   It wasn't just like...
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.680]   Okay, it was me horsing around as a geek at a Comic-Con, but it really was a working show
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.800]   for me where I was taking lots of briefings, lots of meetings, had to write and produce
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.520]   a lot of different content.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.160]   And the iPad was just fine.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.560]   And that's the A4 processor is not a quadillion core, a blow-upon processor.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.000]   It's just an A4 mobile processor.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.200]   So I think you're exactly right when you say it's going to be a new UI because in fact,
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.960]   that's what's happened.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.720]   All of this extra horsepower that's come along has at first was the first just to support
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.480]   Windows, to support GUIs, support all of that stuff.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.680]   We caught up, we are now fast enough for even the most sluggish graphical user interface.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.240]   It's games that's driving it, but games...
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.400]   I mean, come on, games can't outpace hardware by too much.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.240]   Nobody will buy the game.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.280]   Double saddoms used to say something about how...
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.120]   The Apple II first got started, when the person who peers first got started, 5% of the processing
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.880]   power was used to figure out what you want to do, and then 95% of the processing power
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.800]   was used to actually do it.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.080]   Now it's exactly inverse.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.920]   It spends 95% of its time trying to figure out what you want to do and presenting your
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   options to you.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:50.320]   You also see somewhat of a stasis at this point in operating systems.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.440]   Even Snow Leopard and Windows 7, they're just like polishes.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.160]   You got to look at processors.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.040]   The processor I bought is 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   We're not getting to 4 gigahertz processors.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.480]   They can't let a demand aside.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.800]   There are technical limits, so they're adding more cores or adding more RAM.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.640]   I have a feeling that actually I got a 2.6, I think.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   I can't remember what I got.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.120]   But anyway, it's not the...
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.160]   There are faster processors, but I just feel like we're kind of at the...
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.160]   We're plateauing.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.840]   Yeah, well, I actually agree.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:30.080]   I have a Mac Pro from four years ago that I still use, and it's fine.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:34.600]   There's no point where I run up against a wall except with bandwidth, and it has nothing
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.400]   to do with my computer.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.920]   I want a faster pipe coming into my house, and I don't.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.040]   I'm on DSL, I'm out in the boonies, and I get three megabits down, which a few years
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.040]   ago would have been amazing.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.560]   But now I'm feeling like I'm on the edge.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.120]   So, that's where I want to see the big speed up, bring me a bigger pipe into my house, and
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.040]   suddenly my computing life gets a whole lot better.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.360]   Well, I just...
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.600]   I mentioned this so that those of you who have been waiting to buy a Mac Pro now will
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   know that Apple should release new Mac Pros any day now.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.160]   This happened to me last time I bought a Mac Pro.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.000]   We buy them for the editors.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.280]   So, that's part of my justification is, "Well, I'm buying them for the editors.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   I should get one."
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.720]   But the last time I bought a Mac Pro for myself, literally, Apple said, "Oh, we won't ship that
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.720]   right away."
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   And I said, "Huh?"
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.360]   And then two days later they said, "Now you know why we have a new Mac Pro."
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.160]   So I'm waiting for that email.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.560]   You know, that's actually the...
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.120]   This one just came out, so I think you've saved them.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   I think I'm all right.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   Yeah, four years.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.680]   Because it took on a long time to update this one.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.360]   So, you're all right.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.960]   Whew.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.880]   From the bouffant of all knowledge, I am okay.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:42.880]   You're all right.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   Thank goodness.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.640]   I'm so excited.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.840]   Did get my Apple TV came in the mail today, too.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.280]   So, if you were a late, late, late buyer...
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   Oops.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.920]   Oh, did I drop it?
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   Yeah, you just dropped it.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.920]   Is it broken?
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   Is it made of glass?
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   Do this.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.920]   What?
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   Spun sugar.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   Yes.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   That's a good thing.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.320]   They make it out of the same high quality material used for prop bottles in Western movies.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.120]   You must have missed that episode of Cake Boss where he designed it.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.360]   It's all fondant.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.360]   All the way down.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.720]   No, it's apple getting a little bit out of hand with the micro packaging because...
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.440]   There's no room for watching this.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.800]   In the new line of iPods specifically, I'm thinking that if I just spend $150, $175
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.360]   for the new iPod Nano, I want something larger than an ice cube.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.880]   I want a T-shirt in there.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.480]   I want a bath towel in there.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.160]   I want to feel as though I got, you know, $150 for this stuff.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:47.240]   I'm convinced that Fox Pro made a machine to wrap the cable, the power cable.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   Look at this.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.040]   Oh, see, I'll never get it back in now.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.120]   It's like the thing in the fake pecan can.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.560]   It popped out and now it'll never go back in again.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.040]   I just think that they just put all the stuff together and they just dunk it in a vat of
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   like liquid cardboard.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040]   It's like shucking things.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.920]   It's at least solidifies in the shape of this box around it.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.880]   I wish I could get jeans like this.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.880]   No, I don't.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.800]   No, no, no, I'm just...
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   See, now it's...
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.920]   I wish some people could get jeans like that, but I'm not going to heartfully with you.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   Yes, only me.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.720]   There, well, no, see, it's not...
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.040]   I'll never get it back.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.320]   It's the funniest thing.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   So there it is.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.680]   It popped out, but they do a nice job.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.920]   And they're using these new silicone cables.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.000]   You like the power cable on that?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.880]   Ooh, it's...
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.040]   It's sad when I'm fetishizing the electrical cables.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.120]   He's into rubber.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   Okay.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.880]   All right, enough of what Leo's buying.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   That's good.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.080]   Moving along, there is an app for that.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.280]   NgMOCA, which makes an app that I confess I...
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.280]   I'm trying to...
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.000]   The reason I want to do this is Starcraft.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.640]   So I've actually spent almost as much on Mojo in We Rule.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.200]   So I figure, you know, 3,000 in Mojo or a new computer to play Starcraft where I don't
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   have to buy in-game upgrades.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.080]   No, I'm just kidding about that.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.960]   But you do understand now why DNA, the Japanese developer, is buying NgMOCA, the San Francisco
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.920]   game company, that does We Rule.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:22.360]   And it's an iPhone and iPad app shop only.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:28.320]   And it's being sold for $400 million.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.960]   Social gaming is obviously a big bucks.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.200]   These are free games too.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   That's the thing.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.360]   They don't make the money in the games.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.440]   They make the money in...
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.240]   Let me show you the Mojo store.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.800]   That's where they make their money.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.000]   Oh, the Mojo store is closed.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.320]   Maybe they're going to have a new upgrade on Mojo.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.480]   Maybe federal regulators finally caught onto them.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.880]   No kidding.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   That's weird.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   I can't get more Mojo.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.880]   I'm not...
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.880]   No, clearly they need to get it working.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.640]   I can't trade any more real money for fake money.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   This sucks.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   I don't know if this is going to work.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.640]   I'll be right back.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:09.160]   Apparently there's a bug we'll find out about it soon in iOS on daylight savings time.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   Just a word of warning.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.360]   We're going to leave daylight savings time.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.640]   Well, actually, I guess we're going out of daylight savings time.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:21.960]   But the Southern Hemisphere has gone into daylight.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.720]   So users in New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.360]   and Tasmania.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:35.080]   They woke up early an hour ahead this week, according to C.T.net.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:44.000]   The bug has to do with repeating alarms, which are activating an hour early following the
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.680]   switch to daylight savings time.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.480]   So it is only Southern Hemisphere.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.160]   I don't know if we'll face the bug when we leave daylight savings time in a couple of
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   weeks.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.640]   However, you really don't want your alarm to go off an hour early.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:02.320]   Paul says, "We are aware of this issue and we have already developed a fix."
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.200]   I'm sure they spent hours working on that.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   Right.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.240]   We'll roll it out next year when we flip over again.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.680]   We will ship it to you in an upcoming update.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.200]   Actually, when it comes to the next turnaround, we're going to let you sleep in an hour later.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   Give that hour back to you.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   How about that?
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   Give it back.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.560]   So make the alarm go off an hour later than you're supposed to.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:32.520]   Like this, the audience for iOS devices, according to mobile beat, is now bigger than that of
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.240]   major television shows and sports broadcasts.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:41.600]   The daily audience for apps that run on iOS, iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad combined, is
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.640]   19 million users.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:49.920]   They spend an average, according to Apple, of 22 minutes a day using these apps.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:55.840]   That means, if you do the multiplication, that there are more people spending more screen
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.320]   time with iOS than NBC's Sunday Night Football.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:07.920]   So how long before Faith Hill sings a song, "Are you ready for the iOS?"
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.840]   I don't know.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:17.120]   I mean, how many people have yet to train themselves to skip over any ads on any computer screen
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.720]   that they can possibly do, that they possibly can.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:25.160]   Whereas football, if you're watching the bathroom, it's too much trouble to channel surf,
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.440]   just come back two and a half minutes later.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.600]   It's apples and oranges.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.960]   Not many people do what you do, Andy, which is you start the game, you start the DVR of
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.560]   the game, and you go do something for half an hour, then you come back and start watching
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.240]   the game and you could skip through the commercials.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   And it ends.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.240]   It's perfect.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.800]   The game ends right when the DVR recording ends.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.040]   Well, for real time.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.920]   You got to reverse for football.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.840]   If there's a big game, DVR the entire game, skip past the game and watch the commercials.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.840]   Ah!
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.400]   For the Super Bowl, because I can't stay in football.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.120]   It's not that it's a horrible game.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.880]   It's just that I can never forgive it for like always making sure that I can never record
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.120]   the amazing race or the Simpsons.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.040]   I will never forgive you, Evan and Felt for that.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.800]   He's sending night football has ruined his life.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   Those 19 million users are just shy of the audience.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.960]   Just a few million shy of the audience of ABC's Dancing With The Stars.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.240]   That was just kind of depressing.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:28.240]   The more people watch Dancing With The Stars, then use iOS, that's depressing.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.160]   But it is a weird thing, isn't it though?
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:36.040]   If you've ever looked at the top most popular videos on YouTube, you'll see videos that
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:42.320]   have five, 10, 20, even 30 million views and they'll be videos you have never heard of
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.000]   in your life.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.880]   Even though everybody in this conversation is pretty high on the geek curve.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:52.800]   Well, you're not a 12 year old boy, so Fred Figelhorn does not figure high in your life.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.440]   But isn't it weird that something can get 30 million views?
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.640]   And it's not even like, I forgot to say, I know how to spell the name Kardashian.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.400]   I've never seen single damn one of her shows, but I know what that name is.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.600]   There's still going to be a certain amount of reach that television and traditional
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:14.760]   electronic media have that YouTube and online videos and online ads just can't get.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   Well, also they're immediately accessible.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.960]   So you have that factor of, hey, look at this.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.200]   And you can send that around to 20 or 30 of your best friends or people in your office
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.440]   and say, oh, check this out.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.680]   And so that's how it works.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.960]   Well, so, all right, here's a question.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.680]   Which you get your choice.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:36.840]   You can be American Idol or you could be Fred Figelhorn.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.760]   Well, let's put it this way, you could buy an ad on American Idol or you could buy an ad
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.760]   on Fred Figelhorn.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:45.560]   American Idol has 4 million more daily viewers than iOS.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.240]   It is the number one ranked TV show in the world according to Flurry.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:57.280]   So let's say, you know, Fred Figelhorn has 500, I think it was 560 million total views
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.320]   on YouTube.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.280]   So which would you rather be?
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.960]   Where would you rather buy an ad?
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.880]   What's more valuable?
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:11.240]   I don't think that YouTube ads are going to be as valuable as traditional ads.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:15.440]   I don't know how many people it's you're talking about the traditional like lower quarter
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.920]   banner ads that pop up and everybody dismisses with one mouse click.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   Right.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   Yeah, see that's-
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   We're trained to ignore them, aren't we?
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   You're trained to ignore them.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.840]   Secondly, it's not enough space to get any sort of a message across.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.320]   If you have a 30 second commercial and you do it artfully, at least people are going to
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.040]   be patient enough to just sit through it.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.440]   They may not be my God.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.320]   I'm totally fascinated by this man on a horse who simply wants me to buy old spice.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.640]   I do have my wrapped attention, but there's a release going to stick with you until the
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:46.560]   very, very old spices, old spices, sales like doubled after that campaign.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:52.240]   It's much better than their previous ad campaign where the slogan was old spice because maybe
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.760]   your girlfriend is turned on by people who smell like her grandfather or great grandfather.
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.960]   Hi, and I like it true.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   I smell-
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   I'm trying the whole captain.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.120]   I even smell like Phil's because I've been in a ship for 40 days.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:17.240]   I'm going to splash on some sandalwood and hopefully they'll let me into the port.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   Oh, sexy.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.240]   I know what's out.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.360]   I'm spending it in a video to me.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.440]   I don't know if any of you are doing this for your app pick the Yahoo Messenger app.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.160]   Is that an app pick?
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   Not for me.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160]   Okay.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.160]   So I'll mention it.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:37.120]   The new Yahoo Messenger app that is available for free on the iPhone, you'd need 4.1 on
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.360]   an iPhone, features free 3G and voice calling to other Yahoo Messenger friends, including
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   video.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.960]   Could be the new FaceTime, right?
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   Okay.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.000]   I'm wondering if people are like Chris, are people actually using these apps to not get
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.720]   around using their telephone or is it just a convenience thing?
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.440]   I don't think people are actually using it that way.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.560]   I don't know all that many people that are using it at all unless you're 20.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.720]   And then because everybody looks good in video when you're 20.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:16.160]   When you're not, everybody holds their phone up way above their head so that they could
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   do this.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.600]   Because if they do this, you got all this thing and then everybody's looking up your
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   nose.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   So you have to adopt this.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   Oh, hi.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   Hello.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.600]   How are you?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   I'm really excited.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   I'm really excited to see you.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   I do think that's one of the reasons
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.600]   Apple's ads often feature infants for FaceTime, right?
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   Show off the baby because nobody,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   you don't want to really show yourself off.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   They always look great.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.600]   Or, you know, they computer generate the grandparents
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   who look, you know, that little Apple,
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   dried up Apple Face grandparent look, you know,
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   instead of that, you know, Gouty.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   You don't want the Gouty grandpa.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   No.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   Even if he smells like old spice, you don't want the Gouty.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   Actually.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   Apple pays.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   Oh, you wish you were the Fulbright's these days.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   The Fulbright's couple that own parcel of land,
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   a little property, a little bit of property in North Carolina,
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   right up there where Apple's building that big,
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   that big old data center.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   Back in the mid-70s, they bought, they built a modest home.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600]   They bought some land and made in North Carolina.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   They paid $6,000 for it.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   That was a lot of money back in the mid-70s.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   34 years later, right about mid-70s, by the way,
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   is right about when Apple started up.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   So they both grew together, you know,
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   but 34 years later, Apple basically came to those guys
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   and said, "We will give you anything."
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   Because who wants a free MacBook and a free Apple TV?
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.600]   Because we cannot build our 500,000 square foot data center
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.600]   worth $1 billion without your little tiny,
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   little tiny bit of land.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   So what did, according to Bloomberg,
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600]   you've all seen this article by now.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   I just love the story though.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   What did Apple pay for this piece of land that the Fulbright's,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   less than an acre, paid $6,000 for 34 years ago,
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   $1.7 million.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Fulbright's ended up buying 49 acres of land,
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   a couple of towns away in a 4,200 square foot house,
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   and they're just happy as clams.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.600]   I like that story. Everybody wins.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   Although I really so wish that they hadn't.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   And Apple, just like in the cartoons and--
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   Would build around it?
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   Yeah, just build around it and have their little acre
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.600]   in the middle of it, and just this huge black monolith
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.600]   of a building, and they're right in the center,
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   you know, with this little ladder that goes up the side
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   and they have to go over and then down to get their groceries
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   and then come back again and the constant--
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   That'd be huge.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   It would be so cute.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   I just wish they could--
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.600]   And he could probably get a job as night watchman
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   at the data center, so he's there.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   Yeah, or just maybe they're retired, you know,
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   and Steve could come over for dinner, you know,
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   and visit up, and when people are stressed,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   they go over and lie on the hammock and watch
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   as the server spin, but no.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   That was my little fantasy, and it's been crushed.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   Thanks, man.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   Hey, this is--
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600]   Oh, that's it.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   If Apple thinks they got the better in the deal,
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   they're gonna get screwed because there's a homeowner's association
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   in that neighborhood.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600]   (laughter)
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   Okay.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.600]   They're gonna get it for hanging a wind sock.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.600]   They can't hang their laundry.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600]   Yeah, I can't do that.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   No.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   And also they're running a business on that property.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600]   So--
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600]   No pirate flags.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   Ooh, yeah.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   Can't have more than four chickens, either.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600]   (laughter)
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   So that's not so good.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   No more fresh eggs for you, Steve.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   Apple is going to discontinue .Mac homepage viewing by.Mac.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   I guess this is the last bit of .Mac to go away.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   MobileMe Member's got an email.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.600]   Yesterday, I guess, saying as of November-- no, a few days ago.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   As of November 8th, in one month, webpages published using .Mac
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   will become unavailable.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.600]   If you're using iWeb, that'll do it automatically.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.600]   It'll fix it, but the rest of you, you'll find your stuff on your iDISC
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   and you could do something else with it if you want.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   It's been a year in the making.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   Is this the last bit of MobileMe, Chris?
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Have you gotten emails at the Mac 911 page-- or 411 page saying--
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   Is it nine or four?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   Oh, it's nine.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600]   Nine.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600]   411 directory assistance.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600]   Right.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   Yeah, I'll just tell you, call those people.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.600]   Right.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.600]   Talk to them about the scholarship.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   They got 1.45 million dollars, so they can do that.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.600]   Apple warned people about this some time, about a year ago.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600]   Right.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   Saying, "You know, we're not going to do this anymore.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   It is going to go away."
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   Certainly, they're going to be people, you know, like old Apple
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.600]   works people who just cling to it and say, "No, but it's the best
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   thing that ever happened to me.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   Why has this gone away?"
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   But indeed, it is going away.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   Yeah, it's the last vestige of the old-- before they started
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   talking about the cloud and the wonderful things you could do
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   with it, it's that old kind of creaky dot Mac world.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   And it's OK that it's gone.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.600]   They have other things you could do.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   OK.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600]   It's OK.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   All right, we're going to take--
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   Your webpage has gone to a much, much better place.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600]   Yes, your eye disc.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.600]   You'll find it there.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.600]   Now, go away.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   We're going to take a little tiny teeny-weeny break, come back
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   with our picks of the weekendy and not coz here from a
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   Chris Breen from Macworld.com.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   He's senior editor there at the Mac Daddy and the author of
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.600]   the Mac 9.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.600]   1-1-com.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   Before we go on, though, I would very much like to talk about
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   our good friends at audible.com.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600]   Audible is the place I go to get my audio entertainment.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   I'm listening to so many-- I get so many good books on
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   Audible.com.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   I subscribe to two books a month, so that way plenty of
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   reading.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.600]   But I have to say, every time I go to the Audible homepage,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   because they have 75,000 plus titles and they're adding
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   dozens a day, so every time I go here there's more, it's
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   like, oh, I want to listen to that.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.600]   I want to listen to that.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.600]   The new Condoleezza Rice memoir is on there.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   I'm listening to the 1% solution.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   She figures quite a bit in that.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.600]   And it's this kind of book about the response to the 9-1-1
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   attacks.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   Fascinating.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.600]   I'm also reading the Dark Tower.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.600]   I had to take a break because I read the first book of the
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.600]   Dark Tower and it blew my mind, man.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.600]   So now I'm kind of absorbing the gunslinger, Stephen King's
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.600]   bizarre.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   I think it was like he was like, hmm, on Mescalant or something.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   I don't even want to go to it.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   Oh, a little strange.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.600]   Is that the lobster one?
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.600]   No, lobster-ocities?
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.600]   No, lobster-ocities one, but I can't remember which book that
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.600]   was.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   No, it's book one of the Dark Tower series, The Gunslinger.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.600]   Yeah, but there's a scene in that series somewhere about that's
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   where they say it jumps the shark was with the lobster.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.600]   Okay.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   But I haven't gotten there yet.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600]   It hasn't.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   It's so far from jumping the shark that it's I don't even know
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.600]   what's going on.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.600]   It's just, but it's good.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.600]   It's well.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   It's great.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   It's well written.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600]   It's the Millennium Trilogy.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   You know, I'm one book in, but that's great there.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   Andy, what are you reading these days on Audible.com?
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   Let's see.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   The current one was inspired by one of my new favorite TV shows.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   I cannot stop watching the Hoarders Show on A&E.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   [laughter]
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   Hey, I've been saving this comic collection for years.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   Yeah, yeah, I know.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   Okay.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   Well, first of all, that has nothing to do with that because
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   part of our cultural heritage, they're going to be worse on
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.600]   me someday.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   Shut up.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   Shut your shutty up mouth, Mr. Leo LaPortes.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.600]   Shut up.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   Not a hoarder.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   Not a hoarder.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   That man understands me.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600]   [laughter]
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   No, but that's actually, you know, that's why I kind of like start,
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.600]   because I don't, I do have a bit of a clutter problem.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   I like to say things, but I don't, I've never, I'm glad to say
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   that I've never had a problem throwing out like a five week old
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   issue of People magazine, nor has like any, any of my rooms,
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   because I don't know how to make them look like a six week old,
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   but I'm not sure if it's possible.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   I'm not sure if it's possible.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   I'm not sure if it's possible.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.600]   I'm sure if it's possible, I'm sure it's not possible.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.600]   I'm sure if it's possible, it's not possible.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.600]   I'm sure if it's possible, I'm sure if it's possible, I'm sure
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   if it's possible, I'm sure if it's possible, I'm sure it's not
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   possible, I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.600]   I'm sure it's possible, I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   But I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600]   I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600]   I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.600]   I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.600]   It's possible.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600]   It's possible.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   I'm sure it's possible.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.240]   what they're eight are eight MPSO to cans of the nightstand here. I really do think I'm capable of
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.560]   just putting those right down to their cycling right now with some instead of making it to keep
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.800]   in there. A fourth or a fifth day. Right on right on right. So I got kind of I got kind of
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.760]   interested in the topic because the people who are on this who are helped by this program have
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:38.000]   real problem with this. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so I got pointed to a really interesting book
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.400]   called stuff compulsive hoarding and the meaning of things as by Randy Frost and Gail Stakeet.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:50.160]   And it's not necessarily a clinical diet. It's more of a mass market book, but it was written by
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.920]   tooth scientists who explains not only the roots of this kind of disorder, but kind of getting to
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.320]   what I was talking about a couple weeks ago with how the brain works about how there are reasons
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:06.080]   why people develop these disorders. And it's sometimes it just comes into the idea of there is a very,
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.520]   very logical and very, very productive process that the brain follows, but it gets short-circuited
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.280]   at some point. Yeah, I mean, it's probably with some survival thing initially.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.360]   Yeah, well, they get into that. I'm only about five chapters into it. And mostly they're getting
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:27.120]   they're getting not into evolution, but behavior. But they're talking about mostly things like how
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.720]   it makes sense for someone to say that, you know what, here's something that this I should
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.600]   check to make sure that this is for me myself. I'm going through my storage lockers and make sure
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.600]   I'm starting to empty those out because I put some stuff in the storage about a year or two ago.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:48.400]   The ability to go through some stuff you've had for five or 10 years with your iPhone and the
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.800]   eBay app in your pocket and see that, okay, this lights and sounds Star Wars Episode 1 action figure
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.240]   bank is there eight of them on eBay right now with a buy-it-now price of 20 to 30 bucks and
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.160]   absolutely no takers. Okay, so I'm going to be definitely taking this to my friend Steve at the
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.680]   outer limits and getting store credit for it. But for other people, it would be, but you know what,
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.600]   if I hold on to it a little bit longer, I'm sure that I'll be able to get a good price for it.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.200]   It's only going to get more valuable because I'm sticking with it. And then the other people who
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.200]   are this is too good to throw away or someone else can use this or actually have a lot of good
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.280]   memories that are associated with that. And all of these are things that you can really associate
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.880]   with because there's so many things in all of our homes that you have for sentimental value. I have
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.160]   on my kitchen wall a fly-swatter that looks like a cheap plastic giveaway fly-swatter with the name
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:44.160]   of a programming manual from 1977. And only if you know the story behind it that it was a giveaway
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.960]   at the first computer show I ever went to with my dad. Would you realize, oh, that's why he's keeping
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.080]   it? And that, okay, it's okay to keep that, but not, yeah, but I was reading this magazine when my
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.560]   dad came to visit me that, well, no, that's the reason to save it. So, but it's a very,
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.000]   very readable book that makes you feel as though you understand a little bit better about how the
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.800]   human mind works. If there are people that you think are in your life who might have a problem
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.840]   like this, that's also very handy because you might recognize some behavior and it might give you
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.760]   sort of the impulse to start looking a little bit closely at what their lives, how their lives are
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.920]   going and whether they do need help. But it's a very, very readable, very, very entertaining book.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.440]   As I said, I'm only about four or five chapters injured right now, but I'm liking a lot. Also,
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:34.560]   it's read by a very, very good reader. And that's, I have bailed on some books after five chapters
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.640]   because I'm driving, I'm thinking, I really thought I could deal with that little nasal
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:46.160]   pang that he puts into every fourth sentence. And then I, there was never going to be,
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.760]   do you, you mostly listen to the car or do you, it sounds like you get so much reading done,
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.800]   you must listen around the house. I mostly listen in the car. I usually bank
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:06.800]   and when you do some driving then. Yeah, I mean, there's, I moved, there's a couple places,
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.800]   like my comic book shop that used to go that used to go to all the time used to be like a 10
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.200]   minute drive away. I could not find a single decent comic shop in my new house that was anywhere
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.600]   near as good or even tolerable. And so now I drive like an extra 35 minutes extra 40 minutes,
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.000]   just to go back to the original store they used to shop at. So I do a little bit of,
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.600]   I do a little bit of driving and it's just a, it's a great thing to do in the car because it's,
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.280]   it uses the CPU cycles of your brain that are not being used by the safe of operation of the car,
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.520]   but it never becomes so distracting that you will not be able to tell that, okay, that guy up ahead
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.680]   is going to kill either me or himself. I'd rather he kill himself. I'm going to slow down a little
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.840]   bit and move it version of this lane, etc. Yeah, I actually found myself driving more. I volunteered
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:57.360]   to do carpool and stuff now because I want time in the car. I love listening to audio books. I
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.320]   listened to Audible at the gym too. I work out more. It's actually been good for my health. I spent
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.000]   an hour a day at the gym because I know it's going to be good reading time. And Stephen's
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.080]   right. I think Stephen Fry credits audio books with, he lost a huge amount of weight. And he said that
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.480]   it got him to walk because he all the books that he's been meaning to read but never got around to.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.240]   Now he just got himself in the habit of I'm going to download the audio book and I want to listen to
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.440]   it on iPod and take a walk while I listen to these books. You know, he is, he's a great reader
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:30.240]   himself. I wonder if there are some Stephen Fry. A lot of them are the available on Audible UK,
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.040]   but not available on Audible US. I'm just going to do a little search for Stephen for. Oh, yeah,
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.400]   there are. He does Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That's good. Some check off short stories.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:45.120]   He's such a very potter narrator. Yeah. Well, he is in the UK, but you can't get those in the US.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.960]   It's Jim Dale. Yeah, there's quite a bit Winnie the Pooh by Stephen Fry. I love that.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.360]   That's the point about Audible. It's got kids books. It's got adult books. It's got books of
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:02.480]   all kinds, 75,000 titles in every category. K through 12 to sci-fi and fantasy and more.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.480]   If not everybody loves reading or listening to books, but if you listen to podcasts, I have a
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.880]   feeling you're kind of auditory focused, you're going to love Audible. Stuff is our pick of the
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.520]   week and he's pick of the week, but do browse around. You're going to get your first book free
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.960]   by going to audible.com/macbreak. You'll sign up for that gold account, which is a book a month.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.520]   I think that's about right for a beginning Audible reader. Don't try it. Don't attempt
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.640]   the more challenging, more difficult two books a month until you've really broken in
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:38.480]   your brain. But I'll tell you, that's what I do. Audible.com/macbreak. Your first book's free.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.400]   Cancel it anytime and it's yours to keep forever. I think you're going to like it. And we thank them
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:48.000]   so much for their support of the TWIT network all around. Time for our picks of the week.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.240]   We will start with Mr. Christopher Breen and the Center Square to Block.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:17:02.320]   Okay. I am going to show off the Zoom H1. Look, it's so little. Look at it. It's so little.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.960]   Yeah. For those of you who are watching rather than listening, it's about the size of a
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:12.640]   reasonable size Mars bar, except it has this little plastic hood on the top where you have
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:19.840]   two microphones and an X, Y axis. Zoom has been making these portable field recorders for quite
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:27.440]   some time. This is the smallest and least expensive one they've made. It's $99. And it records in
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:36.560]   wave format, uncompressed at 1644 on up to 2496 kilohertz. It also records MP3 files on up to
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:44.400]   320 kilovits per second. It runs off a single AA battery. The interface is not bad. If you can
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.680]   see this, if you're watching, there's a line of buttons on one side. And that's for controlling
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.880]   volume in your play controls. On the back, you do have switches for switching between wave
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.400]   and MP3 files. On another side, you have your volume controls and your headphone out. There's
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.640]   a little speaker in the bottom so you can hear what's going on. If you need to listen back to
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.120]   something to make sure you've actually recorded it. Simple one button recording. It's got a little
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:13.680]   readout on the front that tells you what's going on. It's a, I've used some of these recorders in
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:19.760]   the past. This one has a fairly simple interface, easier to use than the previous one. One thing
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.960]   it does not have is an XLR connection because it's, an XLR plug would be about as big as the
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.720]   right as the device. So you do have a line out and a line in. So you can use an external
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.920]   microphone, but it's a three millimeter connector. So if you want to use an XLR, you can get a series
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.880]   of adapters that will eventually get you there. But the quality of the onboard mics is really
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:48.000]   quite good. It's got a tripod mount on it. If you want to hang it over somebody, this is good for
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.720]   podcast recording. I've done a few interviews on it and it sounds really good. It's also good for
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.600]   concert recordings. Not amazing if you're in the back row because the gain may not be as hot as you
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:04.720]   like. But for everyday really good quality recording, it's a terrific device. So to use a micro SD card
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:11.120]   that flips on to the side here and you can go up to 32 gigabytes of storage on the thing,
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.760]   which I think gives you like 50 hours of uncompressed recording or maybe that's MP3 recording.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:21.280]   So this is a new one from Zoom. And they do a great job with those mics. That's really the key on this.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.640]   Yeah, it's again, it's it's plasticky, but it's 100 bucks. So if you're careful with it,
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:32.400]   it's not built like a tank, but it's it's quite a capable recorder, particularly given the price.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.800]   They've announced an HD video recorder with their Zoom mics on it that I'm very intrigued by when
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.360]   that comes out. Of course, that'll be a lot more expensive. When we use Zoom H4s all the time
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.080]   here in the studio, because they do support XLRs if you need XLRs. So you can go out in the field
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.440]   and record stuff and they're spectacular. So I've got to take a look at this new H1. That's really,
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:20:01.200]   really cool. Andy and Ako, your pick of the week. My pick is something I didn't know about until
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:07.200]   two or three weeks ago and is now one of my favorite apps for the iPad ever. It's called
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.720]   Pitcher Link by a company called Zoo Hondon. You would guess that this is a German company.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.840]   I'm going to guess that you're right. Yeah, it says ZooHondon.de. So I'm going to guess that's right.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:24.480]   It's a presentation app and it addresses every single complaint or wish list problem that I had
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.960]   with with keynote. keynote is a wonderful app for building presentations. As a matter of fact,
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:34.240]   I kind of even prefer it to the desktop version because it's so tactile and interactive,
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.560]   but it has one almost silly, embarrassing problem. While you're driving the presentation, it doesn't
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.760]   display the slides on the iPad screen. It just puts them up on the VGA. So as I'm giving a
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   presentation, I have to keep like sort of turning around to make sure that I'm on the page. I think
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.920]   I'm on. And that's just a silly thing that I hope they're going to fix with an upcoming release.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:01.200]   But the second problem is that it's not always true that your presentations are strictly a linear
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:07.200]   presentation. Of the panel that the presentation I was giving at New York Comic Con was I was
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:14.400]   moderating a panel on a great, Fox new comic called the Vision Machine. And so I started off as a
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.520]   moderator just by walking people through what this comic was and what it was about and taking
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.800]   them through just here's five really kind of canned presentation. But after that, I needed to have
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:31.200]   the ability to really just whatever the panel was talking about, find a graphic element that
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.680]   might help them out. And so I had all this stuff preloaded. So I would go to the comp, the first
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.560]   six pages of the comic, or that go to a piece of art from a movie that Nina Pailey, one of our
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:46.560]   speakers said stuff like that. So what it allows you to do is not only do I've got it up here,
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:51.680]   I'm going to zoom in a little bit. So what it allows you to do, and it really is amazing,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:22:01.280]   you can at any point get to the top of your slide deck and get to like the thumbnails of all your
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.960]   slides. And just the VGA screen, the projector screen will go blank, but then you can simply tap
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.880]   any slide you want. And then it will, the VGA screen will wake up, will go again to whatever
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.400]   you tap. So your audience doesn't see the thumbnails, they just see you're out moving to different.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.520]   You're out of the seat of the thumbnails, but you can simply teleport to anything that you put
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.760]   into the slide deck. So even if it's not part of your regular presentation, the better thing though,
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.720]   is that it allows you to build your own like hypercard like link buttons
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:35.120]   onto onto your slide. So for instance, this was this here, I'll put it back into mode,
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:43.040]   this here is sort of like the static image that people at the panel saw, if we weren't
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.040]   actually talking about anything. But if you look really closely, you'll see that there are little
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.880]   boxes drawn around certain elements here. Yeah, we could see this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.000]   So for instance, so this was this was the static image. But anytime that the comic is about this,
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.640]   this Apple makes a makes a product kind of a company like Apple makes a sort of immersive
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:09.760]   reality device. And sometimes I wanted to go back to the panel of the comic that showed
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.160]   with the device was so people started talking about the device, I could simply tap this, this
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:19.680]   image of the character that has the glasses on. And immediately it would go to that shot. The
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.880]   the people watching this on the screen would not see those hot link boxes, but they would say
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   there was just simply simply see that I'd gone to that. I've also, if you look very closely,
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:34.080]   there's another box up at the top here. And I've set that up so that on every single page of the
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.480]   slide deck, there's always that button over there that will always take me right back to the front
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.240]   page. And so I basically put like hot links on this one top page that would teleport me
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:49.200]   everywhere I want to go. Like when Nina Pailey did that wonderful, see the scenes, the blues
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.440]   movie. So anytime that I wanted to show people, she started talking, I could instantly go to
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.560]   still from that movie. And now a section of the slide deck that would start talking about that
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:02.880]   movie here. On top of that, there's the standard like forward and back buttons that let you just
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:09.200]   simply scroll through the slides as you've gone through. But it makes it so very easy to do these
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:16.640]   nonlinear presentations that it's really become my default, my default choice as a presentation app.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.840]   Now the only thing it does not do is obviously you cannot create slides with it as you can with
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:27.280]   keynote. It will just use you add slides to it just by adding images that are already in the
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:34.000]   pictures library. But big deal, the I would anytime that when I needed like real, real like slides
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.440]   with graphics and text and bullets and stuff like that, I would just build it as a keynote slide and
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.920]   then just do do a screenshot, hold down the home key in the power button. And now that gets dumped
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:50.560]   into the pictures library and I can simply add it to my picture link presentation. I really hope
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:25:01.440]   that I really hope that this becomes the the kind of like plants versus zombies only for
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.360]   presentations. I really wanted to be that that I wanted to be that successful because
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:13.280]   there's still a few little quirks about it that little that lack a little bit of polish. But
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.800]   just this basic feature set, the idea that I can do a nonlinear accommodation linear and nonlinear
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.600]   presentation with tools that are on that screen that let me get to exactly the slide I want so
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:28.480]   that I'm seeing things on the iPad that the audience is not seeing that's instead of the way
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.440]   that keynote does it, which is the audience sees things that I can't see on my iPad. I really think
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:39.520]   that this is almost close to a find out if there's only one or two guys who are responsible for this
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.720]   Apple fly them in, give them a meeting, show them the lights of Cupertino and ask them to join the
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:49.920]   keynote team or just buy them, buy them, buy them. I think that this will really enhance any product
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.080]   because of course, if you want video, you have to have the additional video ad accessory for the
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.160]   iPad. It works by a VGA, but this is the first one. This is the first such app that I've seen that
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:04.080]   does a really good job of partition have essentially using the iPad as a true dual screen display,
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.680]   where there are things that you can see that the audience can't see so that you can really set
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:12.720]   things up and tell your story and drive your presentation in a really useful and meaningful manner.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.600]   Picture Link by Zuhan Den. That's cheap. It's like $3.99, I believe.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.080]   $3.99 on the and still there are people who are complaining.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.520]   Oh, is it $3? Should this really be $3.99? Maybe $3.99.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.960]   Maybe $3.99.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.800]   I think I'll buy this for the cruise because I do need, you know, why not bring my presentations
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.680]   on the iPad? That'd be so much easier. Yeah. And again, I've done two presentations now from
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.800]   the iPad include and both of them where it wasn't just I've exported an ad, I've exported from
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.480]   PowerPoint and run through them. I mean just at home, I developed it on keynote back in my hotel
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:51.120]   room and where I was. I either built them or rebuilt them in keynote and played on the iPad
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.480]   and worked perfectly. You don't get to transition the keynote transitions, things like that.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.640]   The only thing you'll see exactly is the only transitions it has is just simply replace.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.680]   But hey, that's such an easy trade for me. And the other thing I should mention is that I did
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:09.840]   actually have to sort of redo my entire presentation the night before a couple nights before only because
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.560]   I sent them and I got it like a couple of weeks ago, really liked it and sent them an email like
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.040]   a week later with a list of suggestions that I want, including I want to be able to have like
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.880]   set one link box, a master link box that will be on every single page, a back button,
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.720]   stuff like that. And three or four or five days later, a brand new version appeared with all
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:33.200]   those features that I'd asked for. I doubt I'm the first person I'm at, I asked for it, but
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:39.600]   it does show that this wasn't a, well, this is my first demo project that I built in Xcode.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:46.480]   And now I'm going to move on to my EP bird version of a demo app. It's actually apparently
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.560]   something they're really working on and continuing to develop. And that $3.99 that I sent them,
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.000]   I'm sure will hopefully encourage them to keep building upon it. Because as I said,
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.320]   great, great app. It's something I've been waiting for for months.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.840]   Very cool. I think I've been downloading it right now. My app is a, you remember Mo blogging?
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:10.320]   It's back, baby. Mo blogging was kind of all the rage when people first got camera phones.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.240]   There was a site called Text America. There were a few other sites and they've just all
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.640]   disappeared. They've withered away, but Mo blogging's back. And I think this might be the app that
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.400]   that brings it back. It does require an iPhone and it's so good that I actually started carrying
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.280]   the iPhone around just so that I could participate. It's called Instagram. It's absolutely free.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:35.040]   I-N-S-T-A-G-R dot-A-M if you want to go to the website. But there's really nothing on the website.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:42.640]   It really is all about on the iPhone. It combines features of Flickr, Twitter,
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:48.480]   and a camera phone app. So you press the camera button, you can take a picture. I'll take a silly
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.760]   picture, but I'll show you what we can do with it. It comes with about a dozen filters that you
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:58.320]   can apply to the picture, which make it more interesting. You see you can take a picture with
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.160]   the front facing camera or the back facing camera. You can also take pictures that are already in
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.720]   your library and then process them with one of these filters, which makes it so much more
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.440]   arty. There are a variety of different filters. They're kind of like the things that you'd get
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:17.600]   in camera bag. Nothing super wizzy. There's two monochrome filters, one high contrast, one medium
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:23.280]   contrast. There's a sepia filter. There's a Lomo style filter that brings up the color. Actually,
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:29.360]   you know, that made that picture look awesome. So I'm going to press next on it. I can put a
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:36.560]   comment in there. I can add location information, a four square style, and then I could post on
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:41.760]   Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Tumblr, or four square, my existing accounts, all or none.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:48.640]   And the beauty of this is once you've posted your picture, it then puts a link in the Twitter
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:54.640]   or any of the places you link to the Instagram website so people can go see that picture at the
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:00.080]   Instagram website. But they can also comment on it and like it right in the Instagram application.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.120]   Pictures that get liked a lot get in the popular feed, which reminds me a lot of the Flickr
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.520]   popular feed. In fact, there's some really awesome pictures in here. Surprisingly,
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.200]   awesome pictures in here. In fact, I've never gotten one of my pictures in the popular section.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.680]   That just shows you how good they are. You can also follow people. So I've followed
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.480]   some interesting people that creates a Twitter style picture stream of their images,
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:31.600]   which makes it a lot of fun. This has become kind of a secret kind of new Twitter that a lot of
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.520]   people have started to participate in and are having a lot of fun with. You choose who to follow.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:44.160]   You can see some comments from people on your picture and you can have a profile and so forth.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:48.880]   But it all lives on the iPhone, which makes it kind of interesting. I'm Leo Laporta on here,
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:52.640]   but if you followed me on Twitter, you've probably seen a few Instagram pictures from me and you
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:59.760]   can go from there to follow me. I kind of like this. If you're in a photography and the iPhone,
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.560]   let's admit that the iPhone 4 is the best camera I've ever seen in a phone,
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.120]   then it really does give you some great images. Here's a chance to kind of use those images.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.680]   By the way, notice it crops them square. So it's kind of, you don't do the, I think that's how
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:18.320]   they solve the portrait versus landscape issue. Just take it all in a portrait mode because it's
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:29.120]   going to crop it square anyway. In STAGR.AM, it's free. You can download it directly from the app store.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.280]   You can find out more if you go to the website, but not much more. It's not what I would call
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:40.160]   a rich website. In fact, it basically just points you to the app store. It's interesting. You can't
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:46.560]   even look at the popular pop photos on the web. There's no functionality for this on the web.
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:54.320]   You've got to go to the app. You've got to do it in the iPhone to play with it.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:32:01.280]   Instagram. I've had a lot of fun with it. Andy Inaco is the guy who does all that great tech
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.920]   reporting for the Chicago Sun Times with the last great papers in the United States of America.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:15.120]   Bless it. And you can also visit him on his own website www.cwob.com. Great to have you in
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:20.240]   always a slice. Always a slice. And Chris Breen, thank you so much for being here. We always love
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:27.280]   a chance to talk to Chris. He's a senior editor at Macworld.com. Also writes their Mac 911 column.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:33.520]   And is the Mac Daddy? His Twitter account, Body of Breen. Thanks very much, Leo. Yeah, thanks for
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:40.560]   being here. And Andy's Twitter account is I H N A T K O, which I always remember because the I H N
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.320]   is short for I have no idea how to spell his name. It's the best mnemonic I've ever heard.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:53.120]   I could never remember. Now I can. And thank you all for being here. We do this show live

[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:16.160]   a move we're moving target. You can watch it live. Twitter. It's confused me five years in a row. I
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:23.760]   think I finally figured out live.tv if you want to watch live comment in our chat room at IRC.tv.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.880]   And we put show notes on our Twit wiki, which is a very handy place to go if you want to see more
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:34.480]   about the shows we do and the behind the scenes stuff that's wiki dot twit dot TV. And we're always
