[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, a weekly show that looks at
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Macintosh computing as it applies to the iPhone.

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Or maybe I should say the iPhone as it applies to the iPhone.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I don't know. Joining us right now from ApplePhoneShow.com
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and the great Apple Phone Show podcast where you think
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   you'd get enough iPhone news, Scott Bourne. Hello, Scott.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Good day to everybody.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Thank you for sending me the University of Pennsylvania sweatshirts.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I'm glad that was from one of our fans who sent it to me
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and then I sent you your resume.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   You're very nice. Thank you to the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Yeah, this one for Devorak.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Kind of ironic because I just came back from my college reunion.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   How did that go?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   University of Hard Knocks.

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I'm glad that was from now.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   A Yale mug, a Yale pennant.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And right above my recording setup, I have the motto,

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and for Yale.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So I just thought that's how I'm going to run my life from now on.

[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hi, Leo. How are you?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Very well.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You just told me what you studied in college and I think the kids
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   at home would be interested to know what you studied.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I think a lot of people have mocked me for this.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I wasn't mocking.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I was just wondering what your parents thought.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   You know, I never asked them Chinese studies.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I think there was a very good thing to major in.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And you know, in retrospect, I was just ahead of my time because
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   if you knew Mandarin now, you'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   You could totally speak Chinese.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Just keep that in mind.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   You'd be able to speak Chinese.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You're first against the wall.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm totally screwed.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I'm not going to say anything.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You're screwed, guys.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.160]   And you're going to be coming to me asking for my advice and how to ask for a couple of
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   ice water.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.000]   We're so tough now when we want to chow me or whatever.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.800]   See, there you go again with the Chinese restaurant jokes.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.000]   They don't like that in China.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Okay.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   We'll keep that in mind.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   They're not just restaurateurs anymore.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They also have cell phones.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   They have cell phones.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And pink bags.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, God.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   We aren't so much trouble.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, it could only get worse.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   And yes, it has the macalope is here.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, he may sound like Jerry Lewis, but that's only because I'm applying
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.120]   special and coding to his voice so that you'll never know who it is.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.920]   Hello, Mr. Lope.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.320]   And now if I actually try and do a jury and Lewis, the person makes him on top of the jury
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.080]   and Lewis filter will happen.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.280]   It's already sounding very weird.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.360]   I don't know if it could sound any weird.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.360]   Go ahead.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   Just try it.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Let's see what it sounds like.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.680]   He's going to fit in real well, don't you think guys?
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.680]   In fact, I won't have to use the voc order if you just talk like that.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   I'll do that.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.880]   I'll pick up bigger bus five minutes.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.240]   Now, just so you know, we have now conclusively revealed and proved that the macalope is
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   none of us.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.680]   He is his own man.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.920]   We are here at it.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   We're at it.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.640]   I mean, nobody's we're not all in the same room.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.120]   I know that's that's true.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.160]   I could be using some very sophisticated technology to make the macalope appear to be on the same
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   show.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.840]   I would like to say for the record that I did hear the macalope and Merlin man speaking
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   at the same time.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.120]   If you want to hear that, just stay tuned because they don't have a drink.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   Quested the water.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   Very good.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120]   Just like Charlie McCarthy.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   Very, very impressive.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.880]   What do you do that with Charlie McCarthy drinking glass of water to see if Edgar Bergen
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.040]   hit reference in a hip audience will get it.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.680]   Absolutely Edgar Bergen, the world's greatest radio ventriloquist and father to.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.240]   Candice Bergen.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   Candice Bergen.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.280]   Television's Murphy Brown.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.080]   I always like I always wanted to be televisions somebody something, you know.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.240]   If you don't mind Leo, if I could just write this in here.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   About there.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   Right.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   Sorry.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.640]   I didn't know if you had the music.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   I do have it actually.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.880]   You want me to play it?
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   Just pretend that you.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.720]   The little sound or where you can just keep it nearby.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.080]   You know what I should do.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.200]   And if I were really a together podcast producer, I would have this all potted onto the assistant
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   synthesizer.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.560]   Instead, I just have to press.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.200]   Ladies, gentlemen, welcome.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:04.240]   Backalopes have it.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.520]   Second thoughts right about now.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.320]   Not too late to run, Mr. Love.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   You start the show with that.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.720]   We start the show with other things.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.480]   We have many things.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   We this is the way Matt.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   Look, we edit all of this out.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   Nobody ever hears this part.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.920]   I'm not worried about it at all.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.160]   Hey, as lives are playing sound effects, should we hear the new iPhone ads?
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.600]   Are you excited about this, Scott Borne?
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   I'm it's tell you the truth.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.240]   I'm excited that we now have a ship date, but I'm more excited by the cold of Mac ads
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.440]   than I am the Apple ads.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.680]   But let's listen to the.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.520]   What's the ship date while we're doing this?
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.400]   It would be June the 29th for those who are lucky enough to keep first in line.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.800]   There'll be about 20 at every AT&T store in the country and then who knows how many
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.880]   at the Apple stores.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.040]   So that means there's probably order it.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   Well, see that.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.440]   I don't know how that's going to work, but there's 2,000 AT&T stores.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   There's 20 at each store.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.200]   So that tells you how many phones will be available to AT&T.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.360]   And demand is clearly for the millions.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   So we'll find out what happens.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   So there's three of them.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   Never been an iPod.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.160]   How to and calamari.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   What are your choices?
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   I go calamari.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.600]   This is like a game show.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   10 points.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   I'm Calamari.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.800]   This is the first time seeing these, right, Leo?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.280]   Calamari for 200, Alex?
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   Yes, it is.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   Here we go.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   This is calamari.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.640]   So say you're watching Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   Hmm.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.120]   Did somebody say calamari?
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.520]   Oh, I do this all the time.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   He's now searching for calamari on Google Maps.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.120]   The closest which by the way I have on my blackberry.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.280]   So far this is nothing I can't do on my blackberry.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.480]   Well, actually I take that back.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.600]   I can't watch Pirates of the Caribbean on my blackberry.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.440]   You don't think that's an elegant little piece of advertising?
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.240]   Was it going to have John Grubler's face 7 clicks or something like that?
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.080]   Yeah, I think it's ridiculous.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.720]   You can do that with most phones out there.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.480]   In fact, my 95 has 7 clicks.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.080]   Oh, yeah, easily.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.680]   But fewer than 7 clicks.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.400]   The weird thing is, am I 95 knows where I am?
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.600]   Are they implying that the iPhone knows where you are?
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.720]   I don't think we're going to have GPS support on ship date, but I think we'll have it later.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   Yeah, I see.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.080]   That's something that is in 95.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.720]   That was unimpressive only because that's nothing particular.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   Let's look at another one.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.560]   This is another one.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.840]   There's never been an iPod that can do this.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.000]   That's the cover flow he's showing off.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.800]   Now he's going to watch a movie.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   Or this.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Zoolander.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.960]   I can watch Zoolander in my iPod camera.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   Or this.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   It's not looking like a slideshow.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   Oh, I guess the whole thing he's doing is his finger.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.760]   He's doing-- you're missing the point.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.280]   You're sure you can do all those things.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   You can do a lot of that stuff with the phone.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.480]   It takes 49 clicks.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   The idea here is that there's a certain kind of thing that people--
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   I see.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   It's all happening in 30 seconds, I guess.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.800]   I've been holding out for what's that sense of flow between applications.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.200]   It looks like this, if it works like they're demonstrating, I think that's a pretty remarkable
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   UI change.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.080]   Well, I think one thing we know is these are not real time.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   You think it happens that fast?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080]   I don't know.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   It remains to be seen.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   But I think that's really the whole-- I'm missing the point.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   I'm missing the point.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   But I think it's the call wrap.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   But I think it's the user interface.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.080]   If it works like it's advertised.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   It's going to be the head.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   It's going to be the head.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080]   It's going to be the--
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   It's not kind of like a Unix guy, Leo.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080]   We're like, ah, well, you know, I can do that.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.840]   Well, but this is television magic.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   They-- look it.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.880]   I could tell you right now, just looking at calamari, that's not going to happen in
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   30 seconds.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.360]   I mean, they took out all the waiting for the map to load, waiting for it to-- they
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   edited all that out.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.880]   None of this is real time.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   I think that was a cynically optimistic representation of what it would be like to use that in reality.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.280]   Well, I'm saying they should have simulation underneath at the bottom of the screen is
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   what I'm saying.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   Hmm.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.280]   No?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   Scott, what do you think about it?
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.760]   Well, I'm-- you know, I wondered about the download speed, et cetera.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.880]   But I think the point is not how quickly it happened.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.360]   But you would hold your finger.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.840]   Concept that you can do it.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.400]   And the fact that you're going to view it on a screen that's much larger than a Nokia
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.000]   N95s, and you're going to be able to rotate it and have the thing rotate with you without
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.400]   having to press a button.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.040]   And I think both, you know, Merlin and the Lope, if I may call you that, sir, the Lope,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.080]   have, you know, talked about UI.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.000]   I really think the more I think about it, we've-- you know, Merlin was asking me this
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.640]   question months ago, and he was a good question.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   I didn't articulately answer it then.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.560]   I think I can better do that now.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.920]   What's the big deal about the iPhone?
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.400]   The more I think about it, it's the UI.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.380]   Well, that's obviously what Apple thinks, because all three of these ads, that's what
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.380]   they're about, right?
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   Well, they do something--
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.380]   Well, they do something--
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.380]   --cannability, but it's about--
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.160]   Yeah, I'm cribbing from about 15 different writers that I enjoy right now.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.020]   But the point is that they're doing something that Macintosh ads should be doing probably
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.760]   more often in a Mac users' opinion, which is to show you more than just, hey, here's
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.560]   how this fits into your lifestyle.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's a way of saying, here is a series of amazing little affordances that become like
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.160]   a second nature.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.460]   And that is a really substantially different experience from, let's say, most computers
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.440]   were for now most phones.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   I guess I'm turning into an Apple phone or iPhone contrarian, partly in response to what
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.000]   I see as a lot of cheerleading.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I'm still not going to buy one.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I'm still not getting one.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.880]   I'm just saying that at least if that was an accurate representation, I think A, it's
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.480]   indisputable to me that that was a very well-done series of ads in my mind.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.160]   And B, if it can flow like that, that looks like the way a Mac phone should work.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.860]   So, I'm satisfied if that works like that, that that's going to be something at least
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.860]   they'll sell to Mac people.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.700]   I mean, I think people are going to be pounding down the doors.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700]   I really do.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.060]   Well, there's no doubt the initial shipment will sell out.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060]   The question is...
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.060]   40,000 is nothing.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.060]   I mean, that's...
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.060]   Well, that's to the AT&T stores.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.060]   There'll be more at the Apple stores.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   The question...
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.060]   Oh, they're selling at Apple stores too.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:23.520]   The question will be, after a couple of months, and we see how AT&T does with the service
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.300]   and all that kind of stuff, and whether or not the widgets are really coming down the
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.560]   pike and all that, that'll be when we really get some proof in the pudding.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.680]   But I mean, Apple can sell as many of these as they want on day one at any price they
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.680]   want.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.960]   And I do have some breaking news here.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.840]   You're hearing this probably first here, nowhere else.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.400]   We know I'm ready to report that the retail price of the phone without the contract is
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   $999.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   Oh.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   Okay.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   Wow.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   Yeah, that's...
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.000]   And you know why it's that?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.200]   Because it's the same reason why a dog does you know what?
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.300]   Because he can.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   It's...
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.140]   There's so many things dogs can do because they choose to, Scott.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.380]   I wonder what you're trying.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.740]   I'll let you be the judge.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.020]   But any of that, they can get $99 without the contract.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.580]   $99 without the contract.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.180]   Which by the way, if you ever do that, you're not necessarily a person that possesses a
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.620]   large intelligent quotient because if you were to cancel your existing singular phone
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.620]   at $125 and bite the bullet and start fresh, you'd end up paying less than $999.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.600]   Well, the other thing that we got out of Sunday, so Leo, I know you've been a little off
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.240]   the grid, this basically showed up with no fanfare in the middle of 60 minutes on Sunday
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   night.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.860]   And of course, one of the things you see at the very end as noted by our friend John
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.400]   Gruber is that there is the note there that it is going to require a two-year engagement.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   Which I guess is pretty standard.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.680]   I know a sprint that's pretty standard.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.840]   But is that something that's been public before or has been...
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   Yeah, I think they always said with two years.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840]   They've always said two years.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   In fact, they said that the keynote.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   900 bucks.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   Crap.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.120]   They didn't say the $999, but they did say the price with two years.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.120]   I remember them saying it at the keynote.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.920]   And recently I remember it is...
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.480]   I was sitting next to somebody and he says, "Does that mean you get two years free phone?"
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   subscription?
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   I said, "No."
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.520]   That means singular owns you for two years.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.740]   They're really scary thought for me.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.620]   And unfortunately, I really haven't given it much thought until I started doing some
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:24.280]   research on it this week for my show is we really don't know what they're going to charge
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.400]   for the data plan.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.560]   We don't know what they're going to charge for.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.840]   I can tell you, I pay 50 bucks a month right now with AT&T for a BlackBerry data only.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.280]   No phone calls plan.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   It's expensive.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.280]   Right.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.280]   So I would anticipate...
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.560]   And unless they want to screw with RIM, which I doubt they do, I would anticipate similar
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.560]   costs.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.160]   Well, they do have a $20 a month plan with phone.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   Not unlimited.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   No.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   No, actually it is unlimited.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.200]   A $15 one is limited to four megabytes or five megabytes.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.920]   I get 20 unlimited plus you pay for phone service.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.160]   But we have no idea, see.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.920]   So that ends up being more because I think you...
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.680]   I feel like I read that somewhere.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.880]   I feel like somewhere this week I saw a price for data.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   Well, AT&T has been unwilling to confirm for me anyway any number.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.680]   And my sources are saying that as late as last Saturday or Friday, there was still some
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.800]   talk about what those initial plans were going to be.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.760]   I'm guessing they're going to come out on the high side once again because they know they
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.880]   can get away with it.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.160]   And then as everybody starts to go into sticker shock, they'll ramp those down and make deals.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.200]   It's like when the razor came out, it was like a zillion dollars.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.080]   Now you can get them for nine cents.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.560]   Hey, Leah, what do you know about Fine Edge?
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.920]   Did you see this story?
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.320]   No, what's Fine Edge?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.000]   It's some kind of...
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.400]   It's a different version of Edge that AT&T is going to be using.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.160]   Is that I'm reading this off of his modo.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.320]   The people have made about the iPhone is that they're on a 3G network, but they don't support
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.480]   the 3G offered by AT&T, the HS DPA.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.520]   So this is Fine Edge.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.080]   So it's like better than Edge?
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.680]   Yeah, do you know anything about that Scott?
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.480]   Yeah, it's like Edge 2.5.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:08.080]   I actually alluded to this months ago and everybody pashod me, but there was information
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.560]   out there months and months ago that their Edge was going to be better than anybody else's
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.720]   type of deal.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.160]   They're spending a lot of money.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   They're actually building T1 lines according to several reports at some of their towers
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.600]   to make sure that there's good transmission rates.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.000]   They think that their Edge is going to be competitive.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.080]   Once again, the big deal about 3G is in a lot of places it doesn't work or it doesn't
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.400]   work reliably.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.880]   They think that because of the widespread nature of the Edge network, its reliability
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.040]   would be good.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.640]   And they can't say it over and over when I question them.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   What's it matter?
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.400]   Because Lifeye is faster than any of those.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.560]   So I don't know, it's interesting to see that they are trying to beef it up a little bit.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   Makes me wonder if maybe it wasn't as good as they thought it was going to be when they
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   first came up with it.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.400]   I just don't buy any of this crap.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   I'm sorry, I'm so sick of this press release stuff.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.480]   Who knows what this is going to be?
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.960]   Every cell phone that we've ever heard of has said, "Oh, but wait a minute, we've got
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.240]   better than the other guy."
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.400]   We'll see.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   I don't buy it.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   Fine.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.080]   Well, we're going to do some tests at the show, Leo, where we actually test the speed.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.880]   I think we're done with press releases on this subject.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.040]   The phone will be out in three weeks.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Less than.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   Well, three weeks.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.360]   Let's wait and see.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.680]   I think it's irresponsible of us to just repeat something singular saying or by AT&T saying,
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.480]   "I don't buy it.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Sorry."
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.280]   Maybe because I've covered cell phones for so long, these guys, of course their Edge
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   is better.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.800]   Why aren't they supporting HSDPA?
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.560]   That's what I don't get.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.160]   Well, their response to that is that it's not working in a lot of places.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.960]   Would it help if somebody read it to you off of a keycard?
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.240]   That is a good line there, Leo.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.560]   They also Steve Jobs at the De-conference.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.760]   We'll talk about Steve and Bill together at the De-conference.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.240]   Steve had a little time at the De-conference.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.600]   He made a couple of announcements, including he says, "It's really OS X."
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.160]   I guess that's a response to people like me who were skeptical that it was a full OS
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160]   10.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.720]   He said, "No, it's the same."
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.040]   And Safari, just again from what they're calling this, a prudering of these commercials.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.400]   Safari does look like Safari.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.160]   It's got to have browsing and stuff.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   Just kind of cool.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   That would be nice.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   Again, this is still our...
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   Sorry.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.440]   He also says we're not going to support third-party apps because it's insecure.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.360]   But we'd like to.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.000]   He's kind of hedging his bed on that one.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.800]   He's keeping his powder dry.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.160]   That's something he can pull out later and go, "Hey, one more thing."
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.840]   Do you think it's important that he support...
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.880]   Mackelop, that he support third-party or that is, in fact, OS X, are these important
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.880]   facts?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.640]   Well, I think what they're trying to do is they're just trying to control the user experience
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.360]   right now because when they're saying ships, they don't want...
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   That makes sense.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.520]   15 apps that have been developed by somebody else that they don't know anything about and
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.880]   they get loaded on and people all of a sudden start having bad experiences.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.880]   That's actually reason.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   They do that.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   They're not controlling the message.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.000]   That's basically what they're trying to do.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   I think there's plenty of room for them to be able to release a controlled environment
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   for developers.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.880]   You're saying on ship day, it's more important that it works exactly as spec than that the
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.600]   few of us who care about third-party apps get our wish.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.920]   I think this makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.280]   I have to say I loaded up my Nokia with third-party apps and I stopped working.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   That's a perfect thing.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   Ding ding ding ding.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.600]   I have to say that does make sense.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.000]   That's frustrating because that's part a lot of the fun of something like this.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Did it stop it from being a phone?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   No.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.480]   It just did the app's wouldn't work.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.840]   Yeah, a lot of the apps stopped working and the cameras stopped working well and stuff
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   like that.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.120]   I'd say I had one of those experiences that everybody was going, "I want my phone to
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   always work."
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   It's very important to me and I'm always like, "Yeah, whatever.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.640]   That doesn't really happen."
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.240]   Then the other day I had tried to use that selling clicker which doesn't work with any
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.040]   sprint phones because sprint sucks.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   But of course I still had it on my phone.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.320]   I'm trying to talk to somebody and my phone keeps going, "Boop!
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   Can I connect to Bluetooth?"
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.320]   "Boop!
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   Can I connect to Bluetooth?"
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.800]   I felt like I was losing my mind.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   It was really annoying.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   Try it.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   You really want to have fun.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   Try a Windows phone.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   Oh.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   That thing will crash you.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   Look at it.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   It's cross-eyed and then you can't.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.880]   Then nothing works, including the phone.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.400]   Yeah, I have to support Stephen.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.480]   Has anybody watched the video of Walt Mossberg's De-conference where Steve and Bill are on the
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   stage at the same time?
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480]   I've read quotes, but I haven't...
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.480]   Yeah, I feel like I've watched the whole thing.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480]   Tell us about it.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.680]   I found it strangely homo-erotic.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   For you or them?
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   I will for them, really.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:51.760]   They had a bunch of clips at the beginning which I had never seen before from back when
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:58.160]   Microsoft was first developing for the Mac as thick as it was.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   They did this format.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   It was...
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   I don't know if it was Mac.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   I don't think Mac was around back then.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   I can't remember what the conference was, but they were all on stage and it was Gates
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.120]   and a couple other software developers.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.760]   Then Steve Jobs was standing at this podium and it was the dating game.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   It was the dating game.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.960]   Steve would ask these developers questions and the whole thing was like, "Which is the
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   right developer for the Mac?"
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   It was very...
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.120]   I just thought it was a little strange.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.720]   Then of course at the end, they asked both of them to reveal something, or say something
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.200]   about their relationship that nobody knew or something like that.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:41.960]   Steve joked that they had managed to keep that marriage secret for all the year.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.920]   Those were just very interesting bookends to the whole thing.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.800]   I would like to see them in an odd couple style play together.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.360]   Oh, that's exactly what it was like.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.600]   It is kind of like the odd couple.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.400]   Now who's a messy one?
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   Steve.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   Well, it's got to be Bill.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   I would think it's Bill.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   Looking at them.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   By the way, it is Bill.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.160]   After watching this, I've decided that dogs and cats can now start living together.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.360]   Well, I don't know.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.920]   I've always imagined they've got a lot of respect for each other.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   You know, I mean, like anybody.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   Yeah, I mean, I think you can turn this...
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.440]   And you were both there at the beginning.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.960]   You know, I mean, they have that in common more than anything else.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.520]   They were pioneers in the computer revolution.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   I think you'd always have that kind of thing.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.360]   There's not that many people in either of their lives, let's be honest.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.320]   There's not that many people in either of their lives that they can call peers, let's
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   be.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   Or as rich as them.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.680]   Well, just in any way.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.240]   In any way, they've got beyond first world problems, each of them.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.440]   And so there's in some ways they share a lot more DNA than they don't share.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   Absolutely.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   You think about it.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   They're two heads of successful computer companies.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.440]   They're different, you know?
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.880]   I think that's absolutely true.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.040]   I would be shocked for this.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.720]   I mean, we all assume all they must be to each other's throats.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   Of course not.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.000]   Freud calls it the narcissism of minor differences.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Right.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And civilization is just, you know, it's this content tense.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Freud says this is what we do.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.560]   We end up the people that are increasingly almost identical to us becoming the people
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.320]   that we hate more than anything else.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.320]   Right.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   Yeah, that's all.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   I've always observed that.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.960]   That's why I hate you so much, Merlin, man.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   Haha.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   Itch you more.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   No, I know what I mean.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.960]   Shut up, Matt.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   You too.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.880]   You are definitely not the same person.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.400]   There were a few interesting contretom.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.600]   There were even some testy moments, right?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.360]   I mean, it wasn't all fun and games.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.320]   I think Bill really resents those Apple ads, for instance, the PC Mac ads.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   He handled it better than he's ever handled it before.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.360]   I mean, he's been interviewed about them a number of times and he's been extremely
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.880]   hoppy about them.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.160]   And this was actually the only time that I've seen him interviewed about those ads
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.800]   and we haven't practically got nothing.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.600]   He joked about it.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.120]   Yeah, he joked about it.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.520]   Of course, Steve didn't help matters when he talked about putting iTunes on a Windows
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.440]   machine and said it was like bringing a glass of ice water to person in hell.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440]   Right.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.120]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.800]   Now what was, so how did Gates react when Jobs said that?
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.960]   Well, he Gates wasn't on this.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960]   Oh, he wasn't.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.760]   That was just Walt Mossberg and Jobs on that one.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760]   Jobs wouldn't say that in front of Bill.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   That would be.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.800]   Another hand Bill said he admired the fact that Steve Jobs has taste.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.320]   And this was interesting because this is a famous moment between the two of them.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.480]   Steve Jobs was it revenge the nerds or triumph of the nerds?
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.520]   Was notorious for saying, you know, the problem with Bill Gates and Microsoft, they just don't
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.520]   have any taste.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.920]   And that hurt, apparently, hurt Bill's feelings.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.880]   Steve made a call to him the last time they kind of mind me that the last time one of the
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.400]   last times they spoke together and apologize that I shouldn't have said you have no taste,
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.560]   but then just couldn't quite bring himself to admit it and say, but you really don't,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   Bill.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   I think the Brown Zoom answers that question.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.560]   Got an effect.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.560]   And a red one now too.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.720]   That's perhaps they'll retire the Brown one and then I can move on.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.200]   Is it a Bono red?
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   Is it?
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   It's unrelated to you too, as far as I know it.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.960]   Is it going to ship with all the Beatles songs on it, Merlin?
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Actually.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.640]   Don't even start.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.360]   Slowly I turn.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.440]   Didn't Mossberg, though, say to them, what's one thing you like about the other guy?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   One thing that the other one is considered to be computer.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.000]   No, but at one point he said, what is it?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   What is it?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   See, I'm not having seen it.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I'm going to disadvantage.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.560]   But I thought he said, what's one thing about you admire about the other guy?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.760]   And that's when that's when Gates said Steve Jobs taste.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.720]   And did Steve Jobs say Bill Gates wallet?
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   What did he say?
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.120]   I like we've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.560]   I have to say, I like that.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.360]   And I think it was focus.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.920]   Focus, yes.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:57.040]   That's a euphemism for his murderous desire to win at all costs.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   His focus.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.720]   Yeah, relentless.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   I like the fact that Steve Jobs said, no, everybody loves the PC guy in the Apple ads.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   He's got big heart.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.440]   They get true.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440]   They love it.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   They love it more than the Mac guy.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   The Mac guy's a slot.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   Yeah, everybody loves the PC guy.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.360]   I mean, everybody loves John Hoffman.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.880]   Maybe that's it.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.440]   So this was an apocalypse meeting of the two.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.240]   Is there any thing we learned though from this?
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.200]   Steve kept alluding to some sort of an online offering that they're working on.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:39.480]   There were a couple questions about web-based applications and that kind of thing.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.840]   And he said something was coming the next one to two years.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.040]   And then he also said that an update to Doc Mac would be coming.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.720]   And I get the impression that it was one of the separate things because he said that
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.320]   the Doc Mac update would be coming through and rolled through a very soon.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   It's definitely time to make Doc Mac do something for his 99 bucks.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.960]   Well, you know, they announced next year's panel, Leo.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.920]   It's going to be Tom Cruise in Brook Shields.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   Which panel?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   The Doc Mac panel?
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   At Walt's going to interview Tom Cruise.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   Oh, wouldn't that be good?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.080]   I'd like to see that.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.960]   Steve did in his talk earlier to the D conference tell us that YouTube would be available on
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.200]   Apple TV, that there'd be an update, a free update to Apple TV.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   That's cool.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   That's right.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   Cool.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   That worked.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   Do you know?
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   Did they say anything more about that?
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.920]   It's just a menu option just like everything else.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.720]   But the word on the street is it's going to be H.264.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.360]   Oh, oh, so like a special YouTube.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.320]   Not that's what I was wondering.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.520]   Oh, they'll be rolling it out.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.760]   I think, you know, like a lot of these kind of scale related changes, they'll be rolling
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.840]   it out a little bit at a time.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.640]   You won't get the full, you won't be able to go in and find every cat playing piano
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   at once.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   They're going to roll this stuff out a little bit every month.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   That's...
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.520]   Keep in mind though, the limit's going to be.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.080]   If the stuff was encoded, crappling in a shot with crappy cameras, it's still going to
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   look like crap on an app.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   That's interesting.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   Do they discard?
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.680]   They must discard the original after they...
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.920]   They can't go back in time, can they?
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   But I wonder...
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   It's kind of interesting to think about.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:23.480]   Well, what it sounds like to me is it's going to favor content submitted by the networks,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.520]   by the high end content providers, right?
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.160]   So let's go look at some of those great, you know, CBS clips or whatever.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:37.320]   That would make it then very interesting, I would think, to NBC and CBS as basically,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.080]   it becomes another promo channel.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.680]   What's a foot in the door on that device too?
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.880]   I mean, it's something that's probably going to be a lot more costly to get on a Tivo.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.960]   You know, this isn't going to be as wide of an audience, but it's a nice foot in the
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   door.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:54.520]   MTV owner Viacom said it would welcome the chance to license its content to Apple, which
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.560]   is a little change from what their attitude in previous.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   Maybe not.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.360]   I think you can take that as more of a shot against who.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.360]   Right.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   Maybe.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.360]   That's very interesting.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.760]   We don't want it on YouTube.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.600]   But I think users would love it, especially if it were higher quality, to be able to watch
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.320]   the top 10 YouTube videos on your...
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.640]   It's going to take something like that to make the Apple TV experience what we all hope
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   to be.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.680]   I thought it was cool, but I always said, I think this is something to be excited about
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.520]   in version two or three.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.560]   This is the kind of stuff coming down the road I think it's going to need.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:39.240]   Well, people like Merlin and I use the Apple TV really is a repository for higher quality
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.600]   video we put on ourselves.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.400]   You know, it's funny though, to Scott's point though, there is something that I...
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.160]   There is like an itch that I'm really starting to want to scratch.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.040]   Something that a lot of people said from day one, and I'm starting to get it.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.320]   The whole thing of I have to go to my computer to go buy that movie or to buy that subscription
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.040]   or to buy that album.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.560]   And that is vexing.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:02.160]   I mean, for this thing to really go to the next level, there really should be a way for
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.200]   it to be hooked up so that you can order from there.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.320]   Or for that matter, even order remotely from your computer.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.760]   But you shouldn't have to have all these devices you've got to run around to to make
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.160]   that happen.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.960]   And yeah, I mean, that's really limiting.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   Do you find that like...
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:22.080]   You're sitting down to watch TV with your family in front of the ITV and...
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.440]   You have to think of it ahead of time.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   Yeah, right.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.600]   You still think of it ahead of time.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.520]   Which is a pain compared to say a Tivo, which you can just program to report.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.160]   But I mean, couldn't they do something where in the same way that you only allow a certain
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.240]   number of computers to use the iTunes library, couldn't there be a way that when you're surfing,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.720]   say for example, the top 10 iTunes videos, music videos, how hard would it be for there
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   to be a way to click and say, "Buy this."
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.040]   The transaction happens back on your computer and then it gets hooked up.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.320]   I think they'd eventually do that, wouldn't they?
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.760]   I mean, you can do that now, my Xbox 360.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.760]   I buy stuff all the time.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.080]   But on the Apple TV, is that a technical constrainer or a policy one, do you think?
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   Policy.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.040]   There's no technical reason why they couldn't do that.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.000]   There's enough hardware in that thing to easily do that.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Easily do that.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.760]   It's already got the activation or whatever you want at the...
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   Right.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.920]   Now, I think Apple TV, you're right.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.400]   It shows more promise than it's delivering.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.760]   I'm happy with it now.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:26.200]   I mean, it's basically just a gateway into my hide-of-TV for online content.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.320]   So I'm using my desktop as a way to grab content from either by either ripping, downloading,
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.960]   or buying, and then getting it on that Apple TV.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.880]   You're going to have a bigger hard drive, too, which is good because of the 40 gig is not
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   nearly enough.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.640]   Actually, that was one of Merlin's original complaints from the Macworld show floor, as
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   I recall.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.120]   Now, I wonder if I could just put a bigger one in and just take it apart.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.800]   It's just, I'm sure, a laptop drive.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   It could be hacked.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   Yeah, that would be worth doing.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.200]   People might have to distribute an image for a larger one.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   Interesting.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   I think Weakness has a kit.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   I think Weakness has a kit.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   How do they?
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.240]   Do you feel like 160 or whatever drive?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   Them guys, he's great.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   You have to be important, but I just don't.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.680]   Not useful, right?
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.600]   Well, you could boot from it.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   Can't you?
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   Didn't we...
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.240]   You can't have a tattoo drive to it.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240]   No, yeah.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   No, you can't drive without a...
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   But it's not an external...
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.840]   Yes, it doesn't become an external thing.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   That would be nice.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   That would be nice.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.760]   Anyway, I feel bad for the Apple TV because it's got eclipsed by iPhone.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   I think there's a lot there.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.400]   I would like to see them.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.760]   He says it's a hobby.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.800]   Steve said in his speech, "It's a hobby for us."
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.520]   He kind of diminished it.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.720]   Maybe he's underselling it because he doesn't think it's going to be anything more than that.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.880]   Well, a big story this month, of course, and I kind of got bit by this one because I
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   went away.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.520]   I prerecorded my radio show on Tuesday and I said, "Well, it doesn't look like Apple's
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.360]   going to be able to do that DRM thing they promised by the end of May."
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.560]   And of course, by the end of May, they did.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   The very end of May.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.800]   Was it May 31st that they released the...they announced the 7.2?
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.200]   Yeah, today was a week ago.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.480]   They waited as long as they could.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   They got it in and out for them.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   It was like a hide or something.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.880]   Yeah, before the month was over.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   EMI content available without copy protection and in this higher 256-kilobit AAC format.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.200]   Has anybody downloaded or bought anything?
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.640]   Has anybody listened to anything?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   I have.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   Me too.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   I upgraded everything.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   Sound good?
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.120]   I upgraded everything I could but it really wasn't that much.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   It takes a while to upgrade.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.120]   I can tell you that.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   What's the cost to upgrade?
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   Just the differential?
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   30 cents.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   30 cents.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   Hey, that's worth it.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   That's worth it.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.120]   Well, two things.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.760]   First of all, I don't know if it was capacity issues but I had a really hard time getting
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.480]   it to finish my collection for like three or four days.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   For me, I think...
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.080]   Well, how many records was that?
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.440]   Something like...I want to say 70 tracks, 72 tracks.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.640]   Well, that's not that many, yeah.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   And I don't know.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.680]   I don't notice a huge difference.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   I'm not an audiophile.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.080]   I'm the kind of person where most of us are not going to hear a huge difference.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.240]   I notice for me, things break around like...
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.440]   I rip everything at 192 MP3s.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   And so if I hear a 128 MP3, I notice it.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.440]   But like a lot of people, I'm not noticing a huge difference in sound quality.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.440]   Do you guys...
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.400]   Scott, you would really notice I guess, right?
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:21.200]   On the right speakers, particularly something with a lot of clean bass, you're going to
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   hear a slight difference.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.400]   And it's one of those things where people think, "Well, it's 256, therefore it must be
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.960]   twice the quality of 128," which is erroneous.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   It's not.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.600]   It is just simply more quality.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.480]   And it's more than enough quality to please 99% of the world.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   And then there's Alex...
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   Right.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   Who...
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   We don't count him.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   I mean, that doesn't.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   He's an ace of quarter-case.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.560]   For the 30 cents, I think it was worth it.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.120]   But to your point, Marilyn, I have four songs that were eligible.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.680]   And it took me four days.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.960]   Oh, boy.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.800]   How do you find out if they're eligible?
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.000]   They tell you...
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.520]   Now, this is one of the cool features of it.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.480]   If it works, be done quickly, it'd be really cool.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.240]   But you click a button and it just goes through all of your purchase history.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.440]   Notice I didn't say it goes through your library.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.880]   It goes through your purchase history.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.640]   Any song you purchase that qualifies, you get a chance to update.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.200]   Now, this is what's really cool.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.720]   Whether or not it's still in your library.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   So if you've lost a song...
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   Oh, I like that.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   I like that.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.560]   I'll be doing that.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.040]   Yeah, a lot of people don't know about that.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   That's great.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   If you've thrown the song out and lost it by accident, you can get it again.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:31.000]   Yeah, now, the one negative of this, Leo, is you don't get to pick and choose.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.800]   You have to do it all or none of it.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   All of it or none of it?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   That's unfortunate.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   Is that right?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   Yep.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.760]   If there's no choice to say, "I want this one," not that one.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   It's everything...
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.600]   It's a good button, but you're right about that.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   So you did a two-man collope?
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   You upgraded it.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:56.200]   Five percent of my iTunes post-this music actually, it broke off nearly seven blocks.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.480]   You didn't have that many songs, I guess.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.640]   Even though I'm on the wall.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   Not from EMI.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.600]   I was thinking of buying the whole Pink Floyd back catalog now.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   I got it up to you.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.640]   It updated my dark side of the moon.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   Cool, man.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.800]   I'll tell you, every time that alarm clock goes off, I still think somebody's like calling
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   me.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   Have you noticed that?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   Did you listen to that?
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Bong, bong.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.200]   I think what you were here is a better record.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   Oh, it is.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   In fact, I am so...
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   Really?
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   You think so too?
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   I get in a fight over that all the time.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.400]   I'm so proud of my daughter.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.720]   She came out with me to my reunion and we went to the Cutler's Records, the New Haven
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.520]   Records store for the last 800 years.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.280]   They used to sell them on scrolls.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.360]   They actually still sell albums.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.600]   She looks up on the wall, she says, "That's cool.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.400]   The guy's shaking hands with the guy who's on fire."
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.600]   I said, "Yes, my daughter.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.400]   That is one of the great albums ever recorded."
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.200]   She bought it, the vinyl.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   Wow.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.480]   Now we have to buy a record player.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.240]   I was going to say, you're going to need a record player.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.160]   She already has about four or five vinyl records.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.600]   There's USB turntables out there.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   She just bought one.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   Is that right?
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.960]   I said, but there's no point in converting it to the vinyl.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.720]   Leo, I've been to that record store.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   That's an amazing record store.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   It's a great store.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.120]   You know what I found there?
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   What?
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.920]   Blind Faith album cover, the one that was banned.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920]   There you go.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   The girl with the plane.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   Creepy pubescent.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.920]   You're just pubescent girl, yeah.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.600]   They had one sitting there.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   It is because they have a lot of old used vinyl.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   It was fun.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   She bought a couple of things.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   What else did she buy?
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   She bought another album.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   I was impressed.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   She's got good taste.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.080]   I also got a sign.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.680]   Joe Kocker sitting on the dock of the bay.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.680]   Wow.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.680]   It is cover album.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.320]   Wow.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:48.000]   So one thing that people are complaining about is just like the copy protected music, your
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.920]   name and account email address are embedded in the song.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.760]   So don't be a thief and you don't have anything to worry about.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.160]   See, that doesn't bother me.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.360]   And we've known, and of course, by the way, it's easy enough to remove.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.160]   I don't know.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.400]   I think even when you run, even when you run J.H.M., all that stuff still stays there.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.000]   No, J.H.M. had an option.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.920]   Maybe they've changed it, but they had an option for a long time to remove the personalization.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   It's just a, it's a clear, as far as I know, it's a clear text string.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.080]   Now they may have gotten a little more tricky, but you're right.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.440]   Unless you're sharing it online.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:27.600]   Why should you care or should you privacy rights advocates are a little upset?
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   Are they?
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   You told me they were Merlin.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   Oh, yeah, they were.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   I haven't followed this super carefully.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   I think I saw some stuff about the EFF talking about this.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.400]   Somebody steals your laptop and your music ends up in some place.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.640]   But it's not doing your fault, but your name is tagged to it or something.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.200]   Maybe, you know, it means just the question of who needs to trust this information.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.920]   It's probably got something to do with the licensing agreement.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   That'd be my guess.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.960]   So, thanks for panel.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.240]   Well as they point out on ours, Technica app, the entertainment industry has always been
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:08.800]   obsessed with so-called casual piracy, which is us, not the triads who are pirating in
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   the industry.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   I don't like that term piracy.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.200]   To me, piracy means you're taking people's stuff and selling it.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.960]   That to me, piracy is over the years.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.880]   Piracy is one of those words like hacker.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.320]   It's come to me to mean something that it doesn't really mean.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.880]   You know, I don't know.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.040]   Well I don't understand.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.680]   I think it's a little disingenuous of privacy rights advocates not to worry about it in
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.280]   the copy protected music, but now they worry about it in the unprotected music.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.800]   It sounds to me like they're playing on sharing it.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.440]   I mean, if it didn't bother you in the copy protected music, why does it bother you in
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440]   the unprotected music?
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.160]   See, this is the stuff that drives me crazy because I know the RIAA, if they had it their
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.560]   way, you wouldn't actually even be able to listen to an album twice without having to
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.560]   pay for it.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.800]   And on the other hand, you got the guys that want to steal it that gets the RIA all crazy.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.640]   If everybody would just act reasonably, we could solve mostly-
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.120]   Yeah, you're probably right.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.760]   We should get some Smarty Pants EFF person on to talk about it.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.760]   Okay, deal.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   I got one right here.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.400]   Hey, Smarty Pants.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   He's on break.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   He'll be back later.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   Apple is Apple.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.880]   You're full of beans tonight.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:23.280]   Apple is apologizing because apparently a number of audio books, some of those fabulous
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.440]   audible books that we've mentioned last week on the iTunes store are defective and won't
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   play on your iPod.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.600]   They'll play an iTunes, including Al Gore as you saw it on reason, but they won't play
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   an iPod.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.680]   Apple's saying, "For now, don't buy any audio books."
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   Got a thank you for that.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.720]   No, they said just from iTunes and they'll fix it soon and they'll contact you when they
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   do.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   DRM sucks.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   Can I just say that?
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   You wouldn't see any of this.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.680]   It's all DRM.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.560]   If they just put it all on MP3, none of this had to happen.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.160]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.240]   Apple has released an update to the MacBook Pro, supporting the new Santa Rosa chipset.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:10.120]   Since you got 800 megahertz bus, they're using NVIDIA of video cards now, which is kind
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   of interesting.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.480]   It's a faster video card.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.280]   And you can also go up to four gigs now.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   One more gig than before.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.840]   Again, that's because of Santa Rosa and it's the new LEDs.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.000]   Has anybody looked at these new LED displays?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.680]   The LEDs are only on the 15s, but you're not the seven.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   Right.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   All right.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   I haven't seen it.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   I haven't either.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   I haven't seen it.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   Supposedly better battery life, which would make sense.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   LEDs are the greener.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.200]   They got less of the heavy metals in them, right?
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.960]   They're greener or less green?
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   Green or?
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.200]   Oh, oh, oh, not color green.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   Oh, sorry.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   Not, not, not.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.000]   And it's a nice green tinge on your display.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.440]   I see your mean there environmentally friendly.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.440]   Right.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.440]   Right.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   I was actually believed to see this upgrade wasn't any bigger than it was because it would
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.000]   have tempted me to break my New Year's resolution of no more MacBook Pros.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.160]   I agreed to keep one for the entire year.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.880]   There's maybe should buy maybe by 16 or 32 more gigs of RAM to see you feel better.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   I can't.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   I maxed out.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   Oh, man.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880]   That sucks.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   That sucks.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.320]   Merlin and I are a little disappointed that there was no 12 inch.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.120]   You know, though, suffering, you think you're long suffering, Mackeleb.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.720]   I am a long suffering user.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.680]   Why is Mackeleb so long suffering?
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   What makes you so long?
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.320]   Well, I, I represent the Mac community.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.720]   That's enough right there.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   That's all you say.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.600]   To the hellfire of the mid 90s.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.000]   Hey, no more is say no more.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.880]   Hey, I was there.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880]   I was there too.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.280]   I made it all I complain.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   I saw my buddy.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.960]   I go face down in the mid 90s.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:46.080]   I saw some of the best minds of my generation using Toshiba Portage.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.280]   Hey, actually, that's where the temptation lies for me.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.160]   They've got a Santa Rosa Portage with LED screen 12 inches, 2.4 pounds.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   Oh, man.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   Oh, if only it ran OS 10.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.840]   Now, what we need is unparalleleds.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.960]   Oh, new parallels is out.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.160]   We're going to say if you got parallels that let you run windows on the Mac, we need
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   an email.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.160]   I know.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   Let's check on the window.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   Perpendiculars.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.640]   Converging.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.080]   We need perspective.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.240]   Parallels is it has announced and I immediately bought the upgrade because I am a parallel's
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.880]   lover.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.520]   Version 3.0 with some nice new features.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.280]   It's not out yet.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.360]   But you can upgrade to ship soon, they say.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.080]   You can't upgrade now for I think was it 40 bucks?
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.240]   Yeah, upgrade discounted price.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   Yeah, it's like 20 10 or 20 bucks off.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.520]   They're in private beta right now should have a final release in the next few weeks.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.880]   It's got a few things new like smart select, a built-in integration tool that allows users
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:50.280]   to open any file from windows or OS 10 with any program from either OS.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.600]   Don't you like that?
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.920]   And that's also part of the coherence.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.560]   So you're looking at a Word document.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.840]   You've got office installed on both the Mac and the PC.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.400]   When you double click it, you can choose which operating system it opens in.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.920]   Oh, that's sharp.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   Sharp.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.200]   And you can do the game.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.040]   They're brilliant.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.040]   So frequently.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.240]   They did something that I was told you couldn't do.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.280]   In fact, I talked to somebody at VMware.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.920]   They've got support for 3D graphics acceleration, which I'm not sure but would imply that you'd
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.720]   get aero glass now in your Vista on the Mac.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.800]   Snapshot backup and recovery of virtual machines.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.000]   Very handy if you're using windows and you get a virus.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Security.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Don't you get a virus, Leo?
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Huh?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Don't you mean when you get a virus?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.200]   When you get a virus.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.440]   I think this is great.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.520]   50 bucks for the upgrade.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.520]   If you upgrade ahead of time, they've done this and they've done this all along, which
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.000]   is sign up early.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.680]   You get a discount and I did immediately.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   I think these guys are the smartest programs.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   Some of the smartest programs out there are programmers out there.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   Where is the retail for a fresh buy?
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   80.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   That's not bad.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.000]   The drawback is you got to buy windows.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.800]   That's the big drawback of all time.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.200]   You can also do Linux.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   You can also do Linux.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   You're right.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   You can do Linux.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   That's what I'm using it for.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   Oh, really interesting.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   How does that work?
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   Okay.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   I mean, I'm really just a hobbyist.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.400]   I want to see what all the fuss is about.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   It's...
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.560]   I know you can use it for Linux, but I keep wondering why somebody does that when you
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   roll together.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   Great.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.560]   You got BSD.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   I don't know.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   I think it's sort of like being...
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.680]   Linux tourist on the same way with VI, where I want to go in and I keep thinking I really,
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.720]   really, really want to learn this, but I don't want to go move my life over on VI.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:35.920]   Only way to learn to use VI is just to not allow yourself anything else.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   Throw out text mate.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.000]   Throw out Koda.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.800]   You have to just say, "This is it."
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.440]   And then you'll suffer for quite a while.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.880]   I'm thinking about growing a neck beard and getting into enex.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.120]   I wish I knew enex.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   I want to know enex.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.560]   I was just there to watch Ken Kays.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.400]   All these people who've got all this crazy e-max skills.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   It's just...
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.400]   It's one of my great regrets.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.200]   That and majoring in Chinese.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.280]   Good news, Dad.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   I've moved to a...
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.160]   I'm going to be an art history major instead.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:13.800]   Any other big stories before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.400]   It's so nice to have you, Mr. McElope, by the way.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.400]   Wonderful, Peter.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.640]   McElope, M-A-C-A-L-O-P-E.com is the website.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:27.280]   Merlin, you know, we first became aware of you when Merlin just kept talking about you
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   over and over.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.920]   And they doubt it.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   I mean, you know, I don't want to...
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   I'm too ex.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.480]   He's part man, part Mac, part antelope.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:41.120]   I'm not going to name names here, but some of the richer members of the Macbreak crew
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.320]   gout it, your existence or your veracity.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.880]   Not never veracity, but he just...
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   And when I...
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   When I...
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   When I...
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   I thought you were around.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   Well, I just...
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.520]   If you were real, they didn't believe you.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.320]   You mean, McElope, you didn't believe in Scott Born?
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.960]   No, no.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.800]   There's no Scott Born.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.160]   It's like not believing in rainbows.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.480]   I do want to point out that because I became so impressed with the McElope that today,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.800]   even though no one can see me, I'm wearing a suit.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   Wow.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   Because I thought this was an auspicious occasion.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   Thank you, Mr. McElope.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   You're such a goodness suit.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.320]   Wow, there was just dead silence there.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.320]   Hey, that big banana...
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   That was like the cell phone commercial there.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.160]   You look good in the suit.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.240]   Big banana, low sugar time.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.960]   Who knows about this big banana.tv?
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.320]   It's an online service focused on bringing movies and film to Apple TV.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.920]   Now, see, nobody's mentioned this.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.160]   It's not a closed platform.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:42.440]   You could, in fact, I guess, be an Apple TV provider.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   You'd have to...
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.840]   That's like five bucks per for like...
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.600]   Yeah, but it's like, "refer madness."
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.080]   I mean, you go to archive.org and get that.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   It's free stuff.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.920]   25 free classic movies.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.000]   I think we haven't seen anybody clamoring to do that because of the low adoption rates,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   all right.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.480]   I think I spent much time on archive.org.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.640]   Can I just say, go in there and look at the film stuff.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   It's not all great.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   It's not all super high quality.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.320]   A, they have huge amounts of totally free live shows of bands.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.560]   And you can download those and are they an app?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.560]   Well, of course, with Visual Hub, you could just...
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   Visual Hub and you're good to go.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   They got Buster Keaton movies.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.240]   They got a lot of really good ephemeral content.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   What's the guy's name?
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.840]   David Prelinger, is that his name?
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.080]   He has this huge collection of ephemeral films.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.600]   I love this stuff.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.360]   Stuff like "Refer Madness" but funnier.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.720]   And anyway, if you wanted to fill up your TV, it's a great place to go.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.320]   So you and I are alike in this respect.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.200]   And I think there are a number of hobbyists like this who are willing to take some time
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.360]   to find content, download it, convert it, and put it on the Apple TV.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   And it's not a lot of work.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.760]   It's all about getting your workflow down.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.520]   I mean, if you do it once, it's for me, it's like learning my sequel.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.560]   We're like, if I don't do it every three months, I'm going to forget it.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.160]   But with this, it's a breeze.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.000]   And then you have it.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   And it's really nice.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.200]   I mean, if I had a bigger hard drive, I'd do more of this.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   Yeah, totally.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   I love it.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.640]   And I have a broad variety of stuff available on the Apple TV to watch.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.000]   And it looks great on my...
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.400]   Especially when you do it with higher quality materials.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   It looks great on my...
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.880]   Do you do YouTube best or go nuts?
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.880]   Go nuts.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   Really?
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.080]   Do you find that adds a lot of extra time?
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   No.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.000]   What we're talking about here is the quality setting in Visual Hub.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.520]   And I'm on doing it on a MacBook Pro 17.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.720]   And the reason I use the MacBook Pro for this, first of all, of course, because of the processing
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.880]   speed, but also because it's got 802.11n.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.720]   So it syncs faster with the Apple TV.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.520]   No, I love doing this.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.440]   And I'd love to get some ephemeral stuff on there.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.680]   But I'm telling you, go get a copy of the general.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   There was a...
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.600]   They could use a higher quality version, but you can go grab yourself a copy of Buster
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   Keaton, one of the great silent films of all time.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   Jerry Lewis.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.720]   Jerry's not in the public domain yet.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.920]   He's still very much alive, never worn the same pair of socks twice.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   He borrowed socks once, though.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   Did you read that?
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   Have you gotten to that point, though, in the book?
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.560]   You're up to the point where he's building the set for...
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.560]   Is it the ladies' man?
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560]   No, it's...
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   Maybe it is, yeah.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.000]   It's the one where he's at the Girls' Dormatory.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Right.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Right.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.480]   And he's actually building a dollhouse set, 45,000 square foot set, that's all open on
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   the fourth wall.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   Every room, every room, in the set.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.280]   And some lights and mics.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   Unbelievable.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.480]   And then they put the camera on a crane and they shoot in any room.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.840]   Yeah, have you considered branching off into a specifically Jerry Lewis-related podcast?
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.240]   I'm thinking.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   Jerry cast.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.680]   You know, there's so much to talk about.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.040]   I think maybe you and me, Marilyn, that we could do the Jerry cast.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.320]   And I think the mackelep might be in from what I can tell.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.600]   The mackelep sounds like a fan.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   You just...
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   Well, we all do the voice.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   You know.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   I think that's our...
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   Everybody would have to do the voice.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.360]   We'd all have to be in the voice.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.920]   That would be funny for two minutes.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.320]   Well, that's like a Jerry Lewis film, actually.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   So it's perfect.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.160]   I want to get bellboy.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.920]   I would avoid hardly working.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   That's the one I would have...
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.200]   That was the last of the series, wasn't it?
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   That's the one where you...
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   The rubber teeth.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.680]   Oh, man.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.600]   But you know, you got to see it.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   It's like a car wreck.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.520]   You got to see it through to the end.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.400]   Have you ever seen the script for the day of the clown-cried?
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   No.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.360]   Where would you see the script for the day of the clown?
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.680]   Harry Shearer has seen it.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.120]   Apparently there are copies floating around.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.640]   I have not looked for it again lately.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.800]   But apparently it was a 300 page, I believe, a 300 page script indicating it's a 300 minute
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   movie.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.320]   Do you know about the day of the clown-cried?
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   Tell us the story.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   Do you want to know?
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:36.760]   In 1970, Jerry Lewis wrote a script where he plays a clown named Helmut Dork who goes
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.400]   to a concentration camp in 1930s, Poland.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.320]   And it's his job as a clown.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   It's already good.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   It's already good.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.320]   The lure children...
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   Into the showers.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   Into the showers.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.320]   That is right.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.760]   And somehow they had never gotten made.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   Wow, really?
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   But it's your idea.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.000]   Well, he was big on "Pathos."
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   It got some European.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.280]   I think from, I want to say, Sweden, there was some funding coming in, but it never got
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   made.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.320]   I think he retays, he's got the only copies of what got filmed.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   And he's clung to copies of the script.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.120]   But there's some productions, good stills, that got out that of him in the makeup with
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.320]   the stripes and everything.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.040]   It's pretty mind-blowing.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:22.280]   There's an article from Spy Magazine describing this whole thing.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.440]   It says, "Lewis has a copy of the rough cut on videotape.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:32.520]   He keeps it in his office, protected from harm and unclassiness by a Louis Vuitton briefcase.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.640]   Over the years he has screened at a piece of it for a number of colleagues and at least
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.760]   one journalist, attempting to piece together the lost work Spy interviewed eight of the
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:45.120]   lucky people who have seen parts of it to create a roundtable discussion, including Harriet
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:50.440]   Anderson, who I guess was in the movie.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   She calls in...
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Yet?
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.800]   Yerry Lewis, she's from Sweden.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.680]   The screenwriter is Charles Denon, Jonah Bryan.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.680]   And Harry, sure.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.680]   Among others.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.160]   Shouldn't we be playing the rat hole music now?
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.680]   This is the ultimate rat hole.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   It really had hurt him though.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   It hurt him a lot.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.240]   It's something he really poured himself into.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.880]   And it took a toll.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.360]   It's a classic Jerry moment.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.080]   But there's so many.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   I don't know.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.360]   You know, if this is what happens, you become a Jerry Lewis aficionado and really everything
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.640]   else takes a back seat.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   It's true.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.240]   It's like people that are into whatever, like the Grateful Dead.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.920]   You don't get a little bit into the Grateful Dead.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.520]   And I think with Jerry, when you feel the love and the feeling and the thing, you're
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.320]   going to go and you're going to follow that.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.240]   This is an industry that fears a genius.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   So that's it.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.880]   I'm so disturbed by the thought of that movie.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.880]   I don't forget to go on.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.160]   I'm going to find you some production skills.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:46.800]   Let's wrap this thing up with our picks of the week.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.520]   And Mackalope says he's got one.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.520]   I do.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.800]   I came prepared.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.080]   Good man or antelope or whatever.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   Man thing.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.800]   Good man thing.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.400]   My pick is Pandora Jam.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.000]   And are you familiar with Pandora?
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Love.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Got to love the Pandora.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   So do I.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   I love the Pandora.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   A website that allows you to create your own radio station based on the music you like.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Exactly.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.840]   They keep music genome and when you plug in new artists that you like, it compiled a lot
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.160]   of information and to just other artists that you might like.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.760]   And to my experience, it's just been great.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:32.160]   I mean, I don't know what's going to get, you know, lemon, but by and large, very good.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:40.600]   And any rate, Pandora Jam leverages Pandora and it is an application on OS 10 that allows
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:46.760]   you, I mean, the best feature of the jump to the chase is that it takes the songs that
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.960]   Pandora is pointing for you and dumps them tagged.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   This is exactly what the recording industry is talking about.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   Oh, geez.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.680]   I wonder why you can.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.080]   So it turns them into mp3s because they actually they are mp3s as they come across.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   There's a minute to get.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.920]   And I took some other things that are in the stream doing their quick express.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.520]   Oh, it's the mister song.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.000]   The last I've got a damn it turned into that kind of thing.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Now owned by CBS.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.840]   People can see what you're.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.400]   Did you see that that CBS bought last FM?
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400]   It's a little bit wild.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   It is.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   I like last.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.280]   So Pandora clown.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   What was it Pandora Jam?
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.720]   You got you got you're reading about Jerry Lewis.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.880]   I'm still in the jury.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   I'm in a jury mode.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   Lock the board.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.720]   You're totally reading about Jerry Lewis right now.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.520]   So so we'll move on Pandora.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   And go jam.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:44.560]   I'm just trying to see that brought to you from the recording industry associated.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.560]   Shut down.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.360]   Shouldn't be shut down by Pandora.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   Shut down.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   15.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.160]   15 smackers, but worth it.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.240]   Think of the money you'll save on music.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.160]   Merlin Mann.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:03.640]   I said before we started rolling tape that my pick was like.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.280]   You didn't have like pick as.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.040]   No, no, it's it's something I feel very strongly about, but it's kind of like yelling
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.200]   stairway to heaven at a concert.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.240]   Today, one of my favorite.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.240]   Be bird.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.240]   Be bird.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.000]   That guy should be punched in the throat all the time.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.240]   One of my favorite applications is my RSS reader.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Net Newswire.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   Oh, updated.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   Net Newswire.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Just I've been playing with the I think it's been an alpha for a while now.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.600]   Just got upgraded and it's got a lot of nice little cosmetic bits and bobs.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.400]   Just more of the, you know, kind of there's tons of new features, but it also it's just
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.200]   it gets more and more like polished and easy to use.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.560]   And I just I think it's a tremendous if you're going to read RSS feeds.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.000]   A lot of people love the Google Reader.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   It's a wonderful application, but I am a huge fan of the Net Newswire and I do this mostly
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.360]   as a way to just to send a shout out to to to Brett and his team because this is this
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   is amazing stuff.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   They've done Yeoman's work with Net Newswire.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   It's a great product.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.240]   You know, I as long as we're talking about that Mars edit was also updated and now supports
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:16.600]   Vox that was by also by what's his name, but it's now.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.800]   So Brent used to do it, Brent used to have, but Brent did it, but now.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   Brett's right.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.600]   Daniel, Daniel, Chuck it.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   Mars edit one, two is out now.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.600]   And he is added.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.600]   I'm really thrilled.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.600]   Vox support.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.200]   Yes, but you know, Net Newswire, I just want to say like a lot of applications you see
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.400]   him get gobbled up by a company and they the sucking starts and I just think it's really
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.880]   cool that they're still putting love into this.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   I agree.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.280]   It's so worth every nickel.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.840]   Now, I downloaded it.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.520]   I haven't played with it yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.680]   I have to say I've been using FlocksReader and have less occasion to use Net Newswire,
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.160]   but I will take a look at three.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.760]   One of the nice things with the acquisition is it synchronizes with what you call it.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   So that's nice.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.720]   Probably should I should probably to trick out my explanation a little bit more.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.720]   I've opened it up and I'm.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.720]   Yes, I would.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.800]   It's got a new thing called clippings where you can go in and it's sort of like flagged
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.480]   items, but you can go in and find things that you're going to want to like say, want
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.760]   to blog later, put that all in one place.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.520]   I've been using this for so long now that I've kind of gone dense to all of the new ones.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.520]   It's got a neat new one thing.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.520]   I thought was kind of cool.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.040]   I'm not using this, but it's got a neat new, you know, how there's the traditional view
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.760]   where you've got the kind of outlook, three pain look.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:29.000]   There's the widescreen where you get three vertical columns and there's a new one called
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.680]   Combine View that kind of emulates the look of like Google Reader.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   So you can see all your stuff in line and it closes up after you read it.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   See, that's what I like about Flock.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   Okay.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.360]   I'm going to have to now look at this.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:43.360]   And there's a new kind of sexy little, I mean, this is just this is like this little Mac
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.960]   eye candy, but there's a neat new little like a preview of like a little thumbnail of the
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   page.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.400]   I think it's like a thumbnail of the site, but for each one.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.280]   So you kind of still stay plugged in.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.400]   So you're reading, in other words, if you're reading something from 43 folders, you'll
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.000]   see a little thumbnail in the lower left that shows you the 43 folders homepage.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.280]   So it keeps you kind of plugged into the real world, so to speak, of the web.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.600]   And then finally, one thing I finally started using more is styles, which have been around
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   for a while.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.080]   There's a lot of really nice styles and you can make one yourself.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.240]   I use feed light aqua.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   And I can recognize.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.040]   I never, you know, it's funny.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.880]   I only recently discovered that because it's not, it's not immediately obvious, but in
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.320]   the lower right hand corner of your window, you can check the, you know, there's a pop
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   up box.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   It'll change the style.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.320]   And it's only for the read.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:35.400]   I don't know what it's like on windows for stuff like this, but I feel like we're certainly
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.280]   not impoverished for great news.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.480]   I like news fire a lot.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.360]   It's another great app.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   We're really lucky here.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.800]   And I think it's nice that the ecosystem is rich enough that, you know, we can kind
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.520]   of see a diversity of different ways and people kind of specialize in, you know, one thing
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.520]   or another.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.560]   And anyway, love it.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.360]   Love it.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.880]   Love the app.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.680]   Net news wire 3.0 is all about.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.680]   How much good man?
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.680]   Yeah, he is.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:01.680]   And Brent Simmons.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.680]   And how much is it?
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.480]   I'm not going to say 30.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   30.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:13.320]   How much comes a year of, you know, I can't remember.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.320]   I want to use Gator.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.320]   News Gator.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.320]   That's it.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:23.760]   And what the nice thing about that is it automatically syncs your list to new.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   Your tab.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.720]   Oh, so like what I do have between two computers and remember, if you're the kind of person
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.880]   that likes to browse, it uses WebKit to let you look at pages inside of the app.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.040]   If you want to do that, it'll remember all of those tabs.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.000]   You can put your tabs on the top or the left or wherever you want to put them.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.360]   And it'll, I don't use them, but I'm told that between sessions, it'll remember that
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.360]   if you're syncing.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.120]   So you don't run into that thing where you look up, you waste a day at work and then
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.720]   come home and have to reread everything.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.160]   No, you could continue wasting your day when you get home.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.160]   And that's what I look for.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.560]   A good application lets you go away, kids.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.560]   Daddy is looking at his tabs.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.320]   I got tabs open here.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.400]   Hey, by the way, I bought Planet Earth.
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   Thank you.
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   What do you think?
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   I haven't watched you yet, but just came.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.400]   Hi, deaf.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.240]   HD DVD version.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240]   First episode's great.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.680]   It introduces you to all of the different stuff.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   So excited.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680]   Attenborough.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   Attenborough.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   David.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.880]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Scott Borne.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.520]   Well I have a free pick today.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.520]   Yay.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.400]   And it's a pretty big deal.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.000]   If you use Camino, they've got the new version 1.5.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.560]   1.5 just came out.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.840]   It always has been one of my favorite browsers, mostly because it opens stuff that Safari
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.040]   won't and doesn't seem to complain.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.040]   Like what?
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.100]   Anything that's window centric that Safari kind of burps on Camino will always open.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.720]   But now with 1.5, it doesn't even better.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   That's actually good.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.840]   I didn't know that, I see I use Firefox, which is pretty much the same.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.600]   You run into the problems.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.120]   What do you, what are you, what are you doing?
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.520]   It kind of burps on various videos.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.560]   Some of the Safari stuff will burp on video things that are Windows centric.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.760]   But Camino will open them.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.000]   And what I really like is they've really, I mean they've really stepped it up.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.760]   It's got spell checking.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.400]   It's got a way improved tab mode.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.440]   It'll actually, you know, when people have you open a link and it forces up a new page,
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.080]   they'll allow you to put that into a new tab.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.760]   There's a keychain entry compliance thing, which makes it easier to keep track of your
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   passwords.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.160]   Every Mac app should support keychain.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160]   Absolutely.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.160]   It does now.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   It didn't originally.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.440]   It does feed detection, way improved pop up for flash and plug in blocking.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.920]   They didn't have as good a job at that before.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.200]   And you know, a couple of bugs and it's free.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.360]   And I've always liked it.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   I played with it today.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.560]   Now as we speak, the site's down.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.120]   My guess is that they're getting crunched for download.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.720]   Even up and down throughout the day.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.120]   But it really, I played with it extensively for about a half hour this morning, checking
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.320]   out all the new features.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.920]   And I have to say that it's nice and stable.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.840]   The other thing I like is that it used to open up with a default page that was a bunch
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.480]   of gobbledygook about the browser.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.600]   Now it just opens up with a nice clean page with a Google search box.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.440]   I have got to download it again.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.280]   Many Mac people consider that the best Mac browser.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.440]   We're very fortunate.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.200]   We have many choices because we don't have that dominant Internet Explorer browser like
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.200]   they do on Windows.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.680]   We really have some good, didn't used to be that way.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   Right.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   We don't have any choices.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.000]   But now you've got Safari, which is superb.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Firefox.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.520]   Firefox derivatives like Camino and Flock.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.520]   Shura.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.200]   A lot of people like Shira a lot.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.560]   You guys have a feeling about it.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.560]   That's real pretty.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.080]   I have this experience that happens sometimes.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.760]   There must be some key combination I'm hitting in Quicksilver that ends up being very close
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.680]   to Internet Explorer because of once they keep watching.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.040]   Yeah, but once a month they open it.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.560]   It's almost like finding a photo of yourself with buck teeth and zits.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.120]   I open this thing up and it's so painful to look at.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   So bad.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.160]   So janky and so carbon.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.600]   What's interesting about all these browsers I've mentioned, I don't want to let that
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.720]   opera, which is also very nice in the Mac.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.400]   But everything but opera and Internet Explorer either use WebKit or the Gecko, the Firefox
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.400]   engine.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.760]   That gives you some real stable engines to develop on.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.080]   But yeah, I mean Internet Explorer.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.080]   But you're right.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.840]   We're seeing, but I think you're right about one thing in particular is that, I mean, it
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.040]   wasn't that long ago, I remember when Mozilla hit 1.0 got the t-shirt.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:34.640]   And you know, Mozilla was like, I don't know, like your really smart dorky fat friend in
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.840]   a sweater, you know, where you're like, awesome, but like it was not a pretty experience.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.920]   It was huge too.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.240]   I mean, if you loaded that whole suite of Mozilla stuff.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.000]   The whole of the yeah, yeah.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.280]   Look at the way the skins you can get now for Firefox and just it's, you're right.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   I mean, you're totally right.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.640]   We have such a polished experience now.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   We get to benefit from all the plugins, all the grease monkey scripts, all that stuff.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.040]   And I think we're very lucky in that regard.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.720]   Were you on the web?
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   Oh, another one.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.240]   I forgot Omniweb, of course.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.680]   I, Ken Case, finally talked me into trying Omniweb again and disclosure, I do work with
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.680]   them.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.680]   I like them a lot.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   They're my friends.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.680]   They're all a long way and does some amazing stuff from where it was a couple of years
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.680]   ago.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.680]   I've got to download that again.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680]   I've got to pay license.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.560]   You can go in and do stuff like per site information.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.640]   So I'll opt to tell when you can go in and like you can skin each site.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.400]   This is all built in like out of the box.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   Wow.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   You're right.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.960]   I mean, we have some deep, some backwards navigation thing.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.760]   I can't remember exactly how that'll be.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.240]   He does tabs on the side, which makes some people.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   Opera.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.240]   Opera does it.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:45.200]   Opera, which is SH double IRA.JP is Japanese, but you know, they also have a widget, a browser
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.680]   widget, a dashboard widget.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.000]   I don't know what you would use that for, but it's kind of an interesting idea.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.240]   And it's very pretty.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   That's based on WebKit.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.320]   It's kind of a stripped down WebKit browser.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.720]   So that really would be kind of a stripped down Safari, basically.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.880]   Some good choices out there.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.560]   You, Mechela, what do you use for a browser?
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:08.040]   I am using a combination of terminal and Safari, depending on my mood.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.240]   How about you, Merlin?
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.160]   I primarily use Safari.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.240]   I use a whole bunch.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:18.000]   I use Safari and I use OmniWeb and I use Flock and occasionally Firefox because I have
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.080]   a Scott Born-like experience where sometimes Flock, for some reason, doesn't like things
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.280]   or problems that Firefox always works.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.320]   I think it's important to note that the lope and I share browser capabilities.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.800]   What do you use?
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800]   I'm getting worded.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   I just blew my mind.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.600]   Born-Doth protest too much.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.520]   I use Camino and Safari.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.200]   When I can't make it work in Safari, I use Camino.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.680]   I think my cool factor must just have risen a little bit because I do what the lope does.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   I do what the lope does.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   What do you guys use for ad blocking?
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.680]   I think you're open to that.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.480]   What do you do for ad blocking in Safari?
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.760]   I go to the preferences pane and say Block Ads.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   In Safari?
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.720]   I don't block ads because I feel that it pop ups is what I mean.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   Do you use like staff or a pith helmet or anything like that?
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   Nope, nope, nope.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.000]   Cards are what keeps this web free.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Don't I know it.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.360]   Believe I believe in the free web.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.800]   That's sadly hypocritical of me.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.800]   That's all right.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.640]   You block ads except on the 43 fold or 43 fold.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.480]   I got to go lines breaking up.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.280]   No, that's exactly why I don't block ads because I want people to see my ads.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.960]   I have a page on my site that tells people how to block ads on my site, which makes my
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.120]   ad people hate me.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.720]   But I feel like if you don't want to have ads, you should go change it.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.800]   Was it who just wrote, oh, it was a howie, Matt Howie just wrote a really good article
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.240]   on this blog.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   Did you see that?
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.360]   I'm saying basically you should show ads to people who aren't your daily regular users
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.560]   and aren't the hardcore users.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.920]   Don't bother showing ads to the hardcore users.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.320]   A, mostly they don't click and B, they deserve an ad free experience.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.960]   I think this is a great idea.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   He's totally right.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.360]   He's on fortuitous is the name of his site.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.120]   He's got a wonderful new site with basically how to be successful with your web business.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.760]   He's absolutely right.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   A lot of people will tell you, a lot of ad people will tell you that I'm repeating some
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.120]   of what Matt says here.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.760]   The long tail is real and a lot of your traffic on a well traffic site is going to come from
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.840]   Google.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.120]   Those folks will click on ads, but the people who are coming there every day, they've seen
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120]   them.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.920]   Not so much.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.560]   I would do that if I could figure out how to do it.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.760]   I'm sure there's some easy to do in Drupal.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.640]   For one thing, there's a really great open source ad server.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   It used to be called PHP ads new.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.000]   I think its name has changed.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.480]   You can go down to the point of saying anybody who's got Safari on the Mac, don't see ads.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   People who live in Poughkeepsie, New York, don't see ads.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.960]   You create ad zones and then make business logic for each one of those.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.920]   You could even say after somebody's seen an ad once, or they've seen three ads, don't
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.880]   show them anymore ads for the rest of their cookies.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880]   Love that.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.440]   Oh, I'll have to talk to PodTrack because PodTrack sells the ads on Twitter.tv.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   And they use their own server.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.440]   But that's right.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   What's their blind?
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   What's their banner blind?
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.440]   What's the point?
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   What's the point?
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440]   You don't get any clicks.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.040]   Of course, we get paid by impression.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.240]   So there's less incentive to do that.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.320]   Lines break it up.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.320]   Let's see.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.360]   We went through everybody's, oh, my browser pick as you know, I use Flock lately.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.400]   I've been using Flock an awful lot and I'm really like, I haven't used Safari that much
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.280]   in a long time.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.960]   It's usually Flock or Firefox.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.280]   But Flock, I'm just really liking it and the firefighting and the integration.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.080]   Now while I was on vacation the last five days, I took a lot of pictures of my camera
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.120]   phone and this application is not Mac specific.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.640]   It's actually a camera phone application.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.640]   I've even mentioned it before, but I just, I think it's gotten better and better if you,
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.080]   if you use a camera phone and you do upload your pictures to Flickr or if you take videos
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.920]   and you want to upload them to YouTube or you have a WordPress or a Vox or a TypePad
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:03.840]   blog, a removable type blog, you should look at showsyouhshosu.com.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.320]   It works on almost all camera cell phones and the idea is it's one click integration
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.920]   that allows you to upload photos very easily.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.400]   So I'll take a picture of my phone and the next thing I see is a little pop up saying
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   you want to save this to Flickr?
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.160]   I say yes and that's it.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.480]   So, so lucky.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.800]   And if I do this with a, if I take a video, it says, now I've set it up to, for my videos
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.400]   to go to YouTube, you want to upload this to YouTube?
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.120]   And I say yes, that's it.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.480]   Some negatives there, one is that four megabyte limit on the YouTube videos, no limit on
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.160]   the photos.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.160]   You can, the nice thing is you, instead of trying to configure these all on your phone,
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.240]   you actually have a showsyou account, which, so you configure everything on showsyou,
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.640]   on the web, you know, the places you want to upload to and that automatically propagates
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.360]   the phones that makes it, you don't have to mess around trying to remember what your
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.480]   settings were for everything.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.840]   And then trying to enter it on the keypad, which is nuts.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.920]   It also has some other nice features that don't really make sense in the context of
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   what they're doing.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   I like them anyway.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.040]   It'll automatically back up all your contacts from the phone to the shows you server.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.280]   So you never lose your contacts again.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.520]   And they've added something called Zukas, which is an interesting idea, particularly
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.360]   for those of us who make video, you might be interested in this Merlin.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.760]   We will automatically download videos for you and that you can then watch on your phone
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   and later on.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   You can have a cool.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.560]   Yeah, it's kind of neat.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.160]   I've seen this on so many people's Flickr accounts because it shows up a little.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   She says shows you.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.960]   And I think I've tried it on every phone I've gotten and of course I'm on sprint.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.120]   So it's totally, but it's, that's so great.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120]   It takes for me.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120]   It takes like eight clicks to post a photo.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.600]   Almost all phones.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.080]   This, this, this sports windows live spaces.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080]   I'm just a ton of stuff.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:57.280]   You can get Zukas from a lot of places, including TV shows, MSNBC.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.720]   It's a really interesting and it's free.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.560]   I'm not sure what their model is, their business model, but it, if it works on your
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.120]   phone, it's definitely worth having.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:18.800]   SHO Z or Z for our Canadian and Anglophile listeners, you SHO Z you dot com.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800]   That's my pick.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.560]   Doesn't have to be a Mac pick.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.880]   It could be something anybody could use.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.120]   Even Mac users works with a Mac.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.920]   I think we're out of time.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920]   Macalope.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   Yes, sir.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.560]   Didn't mean to scare you.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.520]   Boy, I'm here.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.880]   He's part man.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   Part Mac.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.560]   That's all hope at macalope.com.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.360]   It gets lonely a lot.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.880]   We don't know who you are, but we know you have long curly antennas or I guess you call
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.480]   them antlers in your business.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480]   Love Canada.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.080]   Canada they call them the I think in tennis.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:01.280]   Oh, there's a five point antenna moose.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   Great blog.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   Must read blog.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.040]   I'll tell you, you're such a good writer.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.040]   I was sure you were John Gruber, then I was sure you were Merlin man.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:17.400]   Now I'm sure you're earnings taming way back from the dead with a sense of humor.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.760]   So everybody should read Macalope and you know, we can thank Merlin for making that
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.520]   connection for us.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.160]   His voice does not sound like what you hear.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.600]   So don't make it or welcome Mac allop.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.520]   I am a Volk Garner.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.200]   Scott Born's voice sounds exactly like you here.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:44.840]   And that's why he is the master of the Apple phone show at applephone show.com and of podcasting
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.520]   tricks.com and of the I life zone.com the great I life.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.880]   You think we're going to see I life eight any day soon.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.440]   So October, Leo.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.640]   And by the way, on the 20th, we celebrate the one year anniversary of the I life zone.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   That's great.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640]   Chris will be there.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   Chris Breen.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.120]   Your regulars.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.600]   Who else is on there with you?
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.760]   Well, the cast is evolving right now.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.840]   So Chris Breen and me for sure.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.080]   We're looking to maybe make a few changes there.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.000]   And if you're looking for a part time job, let me know.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.200]   And of course, podango.com P O D A N G O dot com, which is got full time job and then some

[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.280]   What's the latest on the Merlin show?
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:37.040]   The latest is episode one of an epic six segment arc with a guy who I can't stop pinping Jesse
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.160]   Thorne guy who does the sound of young America, my favorite podcast.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.800]   And yeah, yeah.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   Is he gone?
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.600]   Oh, God, he's so young, so depressing.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.440]   He's like 26 and he's incredibly talented.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   I hate that.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.440]   I want to hit him.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440]   Yeah, I know.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.440]   He's from UC Santa Cruz.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.440]   What's Santa Cruz?
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.440]   That's right.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.440]   Banana slug.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.440]   Yeah, he's a slug.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.440]   Very cool.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.560]   I have it queued up on my iPod to watch soon.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.400]   And I remind you, I just remind you every week he is also with Jennifer Sharp, the one
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.360]   who puts out the coil in sharp podcast.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.880]   So you can have a fresh episode of coil in sharps on the street, San Francisco mayhem
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.320]   from the skinny ties 60s every week.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.040]   Maximum fun dot org.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.000]   I think we've wrapped up this episode of Mac break weekly.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.640]   Glad to be back on track.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   Thank you.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   Everybody will see you next week.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.720]   Mac with more iPhone news.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.320]   Actually, I'm not going to be here next week.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.640]   I'm going to be in Vancouver.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.000]   So maybe you guys can do this without me.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.880]   We'll try to do our best.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.880]   Do your best.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.840]   And we will see you on another episode.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:44.000]   Another Mac break is broke hole.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:15:03.920]   Hey, it's the Mac.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.280]   Oh my God, this is the best day ever.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.280]   Hi, Mac.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   I'm like the pearly dog.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   You've never you've never converged.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.280]   It's a such an old.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   More than anybody involved.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.280]   No.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.880]   I could try to build in courage the idea that you are me.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.680]   Well, we've now disappeared.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.480]   We're going to walk whoever the people are not.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:25.880]   They're going to want you to drink a glass of water while I'm talking.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:32.520]   So would people be able to deduce your identity from hearing your voice?
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:33.520]   Some people.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.520]   Okay.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.000]   So what we'll do is that you're on a separate channel.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.800]   That's why I had you do phone instead of Skype.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.160]   So I will process it so it will be interesting.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.200]   It will actually sound fun.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.000]   I don't know yet what I'm going to make it sound like.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   Well, go putter.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   You got it.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Yeah, I'll go coat it.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   Cherry loo.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   Yeah, I did it.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   Is there a cherry loo?
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   I would.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   That would be pretty awesome.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   I need.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.720]   And how should we address you?
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720]   Mr. Mac alone?
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.720]   Oh, Mac.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.720]   Lopey.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.160]   I'll be maybe later y'all.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160]   And Lopey.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160]   After a few.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160]   After a few.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160]   Yeah, I'll be.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160]   I'll be.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160]   Lopster.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.440]   I got a feeling there is some alcohol conception during the lope.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.480]   During the lopeage.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   Red hole.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480]   Red hole.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480]   Red hole.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.480]   Boardy three folders of right holes.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.480]   The windy might break in right hole.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.480]   Totally off-tossing right hole.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:35.480]   Totally off-tossing right hole.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.760]   (drum roll)
