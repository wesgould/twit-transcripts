[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.040]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers Macintosh,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.480]   hardware, software, iPhone, iPod, all that stuff,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.960]   sitting right across from me in studio,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.880]   Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.640]   Good morning.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.120]   Hi.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.800]   Good to see you.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.320]   Good to be here.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.400]   It's possible that Frederick V. Johnson
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.520]   will join us a little later on.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.640]   It is possible.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.200]   We believe that he is en route.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   He picked a bad day.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.800]   He was going to come up and he was excited about coming up
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.040]   and being on the show.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.440]   And then, of course, it's the inauguration.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.840]   I forgot that there might be something on TV
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.520]   that he'd want to watch.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.000]   In the morning.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.280]   Here in California.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.000]   And he's like two and a half hours away.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.920]   So let's see.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800]   Let's figure he probably watched till 9.30.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.280]   Now, he's not going to make it.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.760]   It's going to be close.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.120]   Let's show up around four o'clock.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.200]   The end of the usual Mac.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.720]   We'll be able to all.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   All boot cycle.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   We'll be about to watch.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.480]   You'll get to pee with Scott.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.960]   That is Scott, born, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.120]   who is holding his water until later.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.680]   Scott is, of course, the major domo.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.560]   And a new site that I'm very excited about.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320]   But I'm never going to send any pictures to it.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.920]   Scott, Scott critiques.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.760]   Right?
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.320]   Yep, Scott critiques.com.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.120]   And of course, I'm still running twit-thotor.com.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.880]   But we've opened up a separate critiquing site
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.720]   where we give somewhere between the medium
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960]   and hot salsa critique of your photography,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.280]   if you really want to get better.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.360]   If you're just looking for a, hey, nice pick.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.200]   Send him to Flickr.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.520]   Don't bother putting him on.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.080]   How do you get on Scott critiques?
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.560]   You just mail it to you?
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.080]   The instructions are all there on the site, Leo.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.480]   C-R-I-T-I-Q-U-E-S.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.840]   Scott critiques.com.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.760]   It's not easy to spell.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.000]   But it's kind of a--
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.200]   I read the most recent critique, and I've just learned a lot from it.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   So even if you're not the critiqui,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   it's really a valuable thing to learn.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.280]   Well, you know, when Alex and I started doing twi--
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.360]   people would laugh at me and go, you idiots
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.040]   can't do a photography podcast.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.120]   Nobody can see anything.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.480]   And there's a certain contingent of people that feel that way,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.960]   despite the fact that--
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   I disagree with that, yeah.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160]   Well, obviously, in Alex and I too.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.240]   But for those who feel like there must
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.840]   be some more participatory visual events, here we go.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.880]   Also with this--
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.320]   you know what?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.280]   Everybody on this show, as usual--
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   It's a twi--
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   Including Fred shows up.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.880]   Really, this is kind of a twi--
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.480]   twi-- light.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   Andy Inako is here, who is a specialist with his Nikon,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.240]   especially on diner photos.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.840]   Well, they allow me to own one.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.360]   And that's the biggest compliment I've ever gotten from Nikon
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   or anyone professional at the doctor with a--
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.160]   You may own one of ours.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.640]   We will pay you $50 to strip the EXIF data
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.240]   from all your pictures from Flickr, sir.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.600]   And yes, that lovely voice in the background,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.720]   there is another great photographer from mostly lisa.com,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.360]   Lisa Bettany.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.400]   Hi, Lisa.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.360]   Hello.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.800]   Actually, I wanted to point out that Andy
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   likes to use a technique called the thumb tripod
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.480]   in taking his diner photos.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.240]   We learned that, actually, at the house of Prime Rib
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.400]   during Macworld.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.680]   I'm a French journalist in a rapidly collapsing market.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.480]   I can't afford to buy a tripod.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.240]   So Lisa, would you describe how this thumb tripod technique
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.160]   works?
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.760]   Well, he puts his hand against the table, raises his thumb,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.600]   and then holds the camera tightly against it.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.360]   It works?
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.240]   I actually have a--
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.600]   It could sound like a silly and pathetic thing.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.640]   OK, maybe I can't afford that F1.4 lens on the SLR.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.840]   Maybe I did just bring a pocket camera.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   Maybe I did bring a whole bunch of Ziploc baggie
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.120]   so I could take some meat home for the rest of the week.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.800]   I got home.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.000]   But still a good person.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You are.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.960]   My first-- we still love you, Andy.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   It's OK.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   Already, you know what you've been on for five minutes,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.640]   and you've humiliated Andy.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   Oh, it was an invented method.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.760]   And I think it was chocolate.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.840]   I think it was good.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.600]   Yeah, and in fact, Lisa is really big on kind of do-it-yourself.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   Things like this.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000]   I think she was honoring you, Andy.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.600]   It's mostly an emotional ploy to A, get a lunch date,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.480]   and B, get you to pick up a check on the date deal.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.800]   Usually it works, deal.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.080]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.760]   The annual Twit Kit together during Macrik quickly.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.160]   One of the highlights of the show for me.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.680]   Thank you.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.800]   I had a blast.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.480]   It was really great to have you all there.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.880]   So let's see, geographically, we've got Vancouver.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.280]   For at Lisa, we've got Gig Haba with Mr. Born.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.080]   Couple of us in Petaluma.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.280]   We've got Frederick V. Johnson somewhere.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.000]   But on Highway 101.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.560]   And from Boston, Massachusetts, Mr. Andy and Notco.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.760]   And they're of course-
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   Standing the globe.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   Standing the globe.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   Standing the globe.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.440]   Have we talked since-
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   Oh, look at that.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.640]   He made it.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.920]   Before we actually began news, we delayed it as long as possible for you, Fred.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.560]   Frederick V. Johnson.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   And he's got a Twit mug.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   He brought his own.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.640]   He's ready to roll.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.640]   He's handed.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   Look.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.120]   It's nice to meet you, finally.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.280]   Thank you so much for coming in.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   Thank you.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   It's really great to meet you.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.280]   Good to see you.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.360]   And put that mic right up against your mouth there.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.440]   See how Alex is doing that?
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.960]   You don't have a pop filter though, so you can't pop.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   No peas allowed.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Yes.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   Fred is a regular on Twit by now.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   Yes.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   And until recently, he worked at Toby.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.600]   You know how I know that?
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   I know.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   [laughter]
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   You guys, I was scheduled to be on your show the day of reckoning.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.840]   We had booked an interview with Adobe to talk about Lightroom.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.120]   And with Fred, and I, you know, it was funny because the Adobe PR people didn't realize
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.120]   I know Fred.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120]   I know Fred is.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.680]   And so it wasn't like, you know what I was saying?
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.120]   I said, well, get him on Skype.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.480]   I said, well, we don't know if he does Skype.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.320]   I said, he does Skype.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   [laughter]
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   So they were kind of not to--
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.480]   I don't know if he knows about that stuff.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.280]   They were kind of not to occlude in anyway.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.320]   And then we got a message saying, it'll be Tom Haugherty.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   Yep.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.000]   And Dane, I love Dane.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And then said, well, we don't book topics.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.640]   We book people.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.080]   When can we talk to Fred?
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.480]   And they said, you won't be talking to Fred.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   [laughter]
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.720]   They never really said what happened to Fred.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   I love it.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.240]   I have to ask around to find out.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.520]   And you're like, so glad to have you.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.760]   And what are you doing now instead of--
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   I, you know what?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.120]   Since the layoffs last month, I've been sort of decompressing and using this time to sort
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.560]   of, you know, as many of the people in the United States that got laid off, are you
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.320]   going to have to do this time to sort of reevaluate what you want to do, you know?
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.480]   Do I want to jump back into Puerto America or do I want to do something on my own?
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.800]   So, you know, I'm sort of in that field right now, you know, waiting for money to run out.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   [laughter]
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.480]   So that's what you're saying.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   What are you doing now?
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.800]   I'm waiting for my money to run out.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.880]   Handy, you should be trying to have a thumb tripod.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   That's good.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.720]   You might need to be using that thumb tripod technique a little later on.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.040]   No, you're going to-- I'm sure you have many options.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.400]   You've already set up a website.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.720]   I have, yeah.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.880]   My website's at FrederickVan.com.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.000]   That's my blog.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.440]   And it's been going since before I joined Adobe, so, you know, they couldn't take that away
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   from me.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   They can't take that.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   So that would be--
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   They took my MacBook, but they--
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   They did?
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   They did?
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   Of course, it was their MacBook.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.440]   Even a shiny one.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   Technically, it was their MacBook, but it was the last year's model, you know, or the
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440]   previous edition.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   So I--
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.440]   So you got a new one.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   Had to upgrade to my new 15-inch--
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   Ah, shucks.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.520]   --and I'm happy with it.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   And look what's on the front cover of Frederick Vanda, as Alex Lindsay.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   So is this as incestuous as you can get?
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.160]   Yes, Alex, Alex.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.000]   I interviewed Alex with my G9 camera.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.480]   What was it, a couple weeks ago?
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   Yeah, it's cool, right?
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   So that's something you might want to do more of?
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   That's really neat.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   I love doing that stuff.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   It's fun.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   You know, there's lots of interviews up there, actually.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.880]   So let's-- I'm-- Frederick, I'm so glad you made it.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.120]   You must have hustled up here.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120]   Did you leave right after the--
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.320]   I left right before--
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   before the poem?
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   Yeah, you picked a good time.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   Yeah, it was a good time.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   Soon as you started talking, you know, I was like, you know what?
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   I could catch this later.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   You got it on T-Vogue.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   It's T-Vogue.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   Yeah, everything's T-Vogue.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   T-Vogue and everything.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   But I wanted to see the rest of it live.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   As soon as I was over, boom, I was over there.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   Did they broadcast Lisa the inauguration in Canada?
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   I think so.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   I would hope so.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   You didn't watch it.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   I didn't watch it.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   You don't really care.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   I care.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   I really do care.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   But--
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   No, no, you don't really care.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   I might have been sleeping.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   That's what T-Vogue's for.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   So Apple announces 15,000 apps now on the iPhone App Store.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   Only 10,000 of them are tip calculators.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   And half a billion downloads.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   Now, downloads is misleading because downloads is--
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   I mean, how many times have I downloaded, you know, Twitter-ific?
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   I mean, downloads doesn't mean that application's sold.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   Right.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   Still, still, it's a lot of applications.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   It's a big number.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   It is a big number for how many months sold, six months old?
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   You know, I wonder what that means.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   Because yesterday I had an issue with my phone and I--
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   and it was acting crazy.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   So I decided, you know what?
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   I'm just going to restore it and, you know, bring it back to life.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   And I did that.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   And half of my applications said I needed to redownload them.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.320]   So I'm wondering how much of that is in that number.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   You know, I'm sure it's not that much.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   But, you know, I'm sitting there like 15 apps.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   You've got to redownload, you know, 2EP.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   And those are the updates I think.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.320]   Because I know when I-- oh, no, no, the apps were just not on the--
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   I knew it wasn't on.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320]   They're not on the--
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   I think it's pretty clear that half a billion is kind of meaningless.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   We don't know how many are sold.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   It's still going to be more than 10.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   I just got a text message from Apple.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   Stop talking about the number.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.320]   Said half a billion.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   They do seem to time their announcements to our show, don't they?
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   That's part of being on Tuesday.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   That's part of the cost of a Tuesday show.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   The cost of a Tuesday show.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   This is the day for announcements.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   It seems to follow a regular pattern, Leo.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.320]   The Apple announce is kind of a new thing and a new system.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   A bunch of people complain.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   And then we see these massive numbers.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   When did Steve Jobs announce the medical leave of absence?
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   Was that after-- I can't remember.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   Was that after our show last week or was it--
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   It was after.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   So we haven't talked about that yet.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   I guess we haven't.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   I guess we just talked about last week.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.320]   We just talked about last week.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   I mean, I've spent the last seven days talking about it, but we didn't talk about it on
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   that break weekly.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   Well, you had a good source, Leo, that said the first announcement didn't sound right.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   And we've since heard in a couple of journalists who are well known and a couple who aren't
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   well known say that the problem really is that Steve simply hasn't come to grips with his
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   issues.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   Or it could be.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   And we've all had this probably experience.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   They didn't know.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   They were-- that Steve may not be even have kind of grips with it, maybe that he just
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   didn't know and that the information has been coming out.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   I can tell you as someone who's had recent health issues, the one thing that disturbs
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   me about all of this is that A, there seems to be Glee occasionally and is it trouble.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.720]   And B, I can certainly identify with why he wants to say things like it's none of your
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.520]   business because it does get overwhelming.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.080]   And I would just urge everyone who either A finds need for Glee or B finds that they
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:44.880]   have some right information to ask themselves, how would they feel if this was them?
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   So the question, I guess, is how does Apple fare?
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.120]   I mean, we don't know if he's coming back or not.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.400]   I mean, he says he's coming back, but I think there's some chance he's not coming back.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.880]   How does Apple fare over the next six months?
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.240]   And then how does Apple fare-- if he doesn't come back?
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.440]   Is Steve Jobs critical to Apple?
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   I was actually talking about this last night with a friend.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:18.320]   And I was thinking that to pin all of Apple's success on Steve Jobs is a mistake.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.520]   And he's not infallible.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.640]   And I think that even without him, Apple will do well.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.040]   I think a lot of people think that Apple needs to be Steve Jobs because they did so badly
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.000]   without him the first time.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.600]   But the conditions of his departure are very different this time.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.800]   He's had four years to prepare.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.240]   Alex-- well, yeah, he's-- and he's had 10 years to develop the culture that's now Apple.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.920]   It's much different than it was.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.600]   He was kind of bum rushed out by John Scully last time.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.800]   Oh, and I think he was much younger when he did it.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.120]   And I think that there is-- when you-- Frederick, you've worked at Apple.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.680]   And there's a focus when working at Apple in meetings, for instance, because of anybody
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.040]   who's connected to Steve has a certain focus to it.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   There's no small talk.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.240]   There's no extraneous talk.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.760]   There is-- you talk about the subject that's in front of you, and then you move on.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.440]   And everything is focused on how do we move this down the path.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.720]   And that's not something that happens just when Steve's in the office.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.120]   That happens with every meeting every time you're at Apple is a focus that I don't see
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120]   anywhere else.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.560]   And sometimes that's good and sometimes it's not.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.200]   But it's-- sometimes you feel like there are things that you could-- that would be useful
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   to say.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.440]   But it's an extremely laser focus on whatever the issue is at hand.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   I mean, would you--
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.640]   I totally agree with that.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.720]   I think-- and I agree with Lisa as well.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.880]   I think if people go down the path of saying that this whole organization, that is Apple,
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:51.400]   the machine, the glossy Apple product building machine that is in Cupertino is all headed
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.920]   and dependent on one guy.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.360]   I think that's a little myopic.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.640]   And I also think that looking at it from the standpoint of they brought this brilliant
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:07.680]   guy in there, and he made some changes when he got there, he put in place the mechanism
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.320]   to build these products.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.000]   That mechanism is still there.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.120]   I'm sure he's not the golden goose and they have to go into his cage and pull out the
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.440]   idea every now and then and go run with it.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:24.240]   He's surrounded by brilliant people that he cultivated that are making the products that
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   are Apple.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.520]   So I think if Steve does leave the company, of course it'll be sad.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.280]   And I'm sure there'll be some impact overall.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.440]   But there's some spare tires there, I think.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.160]   And I think they can survive.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.840]   And I think there's just many things that are going--
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.400]   There's mitigating factors either way, because I think that there is an incredible bottleneck
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.240]   right now that gets formed around Steve that is not necessarily healthy all the time for
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   Apple.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.800]   So I think that six months of breathing room, which I don't think is going to change anything
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   in the Apple trajectory.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.120]   I don't think we would see an Apple trajectory change for two years if Steve wasn't-- never
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   showed up at all.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:07.040]   You know, I think that it's-- the product plans are usually pretty far out into the future.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.360]   They're not something that's going to come up in the next couple months.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.800]   It isn't Steve though-- well, for one thing, you know, in a company where the guy has been
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   the guy.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   And I really want-- actually, Alex and Fred, you should talk about this having been inside
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.400]   the doors.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.920]   And every decision seems to go through Steve.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.800]   Isn't there a power vacuum when a guy like that leaves a company?
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.320]   I mean, that's a big deal.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.960]   I mean, you know, there's that whole culture within the company of, you know, Steve said,
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   you know--
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   Right.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.160]   You know, people that are close to Steve, Steve are able to wield that power.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.440]   Well, Steve said, do this.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.440]   Do you want to challenge me on that?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   You know?
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   Right.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.760]   Oh, no, OK, we'll take your word for it.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.720]   You know, so there's that.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.640]   And when that sort of bottleneck goes away, what's going to happen?
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.280]   Well, I think that it could be anarchy or it could be like, oh, great.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.120]   There might be a vacuum of power.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   I think it would power.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   I think it would power.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   I think it would power because there's so many creative people at Apple.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.400]   I think the greater danger is that too many people want to go in too many different directions.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.880]   A lot of people feel very contained there oftentimes.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.720]   They have a lot of things sitting on their projects.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.920]   And because Steve's not interested in it, they're not-- you know, there's no oxygen.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.920]   You know, for that.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.920]   And there might be a reason for that, though.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   Right.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.200]   So if those products get out, you know, like a new nurse, they-- not that the new one was
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.480]   bad because I had one.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.960]   But you know, something that shouldn't-- or is too early for its time--
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   Right.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.720]   --that Steve has the vision to say, you know what?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.600]   It's not-- we're not ready for that yet.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.400]   And now that he's not in that place to squash it, you know, if he's able to-- you know, that
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   person can push it.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   Does that happen a lot, you think?
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   I don't know.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   I wasn't at that level even.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.600]   You hear a lot of the folks that I've talked to that will say, oh, there was this product
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.600]   that was built, done, ready to go.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.120]   And they just-- they just buried it because they decided it wasn't worth it.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   And they all really, really wish that product to come out.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.280]   Now, we might see more of those, which may or may not be good.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   You know--
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   There's my question.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.480]   Isn't Apple at a-- at a different place now, a mature company with three very strong product
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.160]   lines, the Mac product line, the iPhone product line, the iPod product line?
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.440]   There's a lot of time now to kind of capitalize on those without coming out with anything brand
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   new, whizzy.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   In fact, it might be kind of hard to come out with something brand new and whizzy that would
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   be that important.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.440]   And maybe it's time to-- maybe for 10 years to consolidate.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.960]   Admittedly, at some point, Apple's going to have to take some leadership.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.840]   And I mean, that's always a problem.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.920]   I mean, Microsoft's in that situation now where they're just got mature products and
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.040]   it's hard for them to come up with anything really new and exciting.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.840]   Why I think-- I think we're still going to see exciting things coming out, Apple.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   I think there's a lot of things in there.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   There's stuff in the pipeline.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.360]   There's stuff in the pipeline for the next year or two.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   And I think--
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.040]   Now, Alex actually has something he knows which we'll talk about later.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   I don't know anything.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.560]   Please, you've got a complete inside.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   I know nothing.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560]   Exclusion.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   I know nothing.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   So--
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.000]   Well, Lisa, you went to Mackerel for the first time not knowing Steve wouldn't be giving
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.760]   the keynote.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.560]   Would you go back now knowing that Steve's not going to be-- in fact, Apple's not going
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   to be there.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.960]   I mean, how important is Steve to the fans?
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.640]   Oh, well, yes.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.000]   I mean, that was just pointing.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.200]   But I think that at World Wide Developers Conference, he started to introduce this to
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   other key figures in the company.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:21.560]   And I think just sort of getting to know the other people involved in Apple sort of distracted
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   people from the fact that he wasn't going to be such a leader anymore.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.560]   And--
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.800]   So we kind of knew it was coming.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   I think so.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.400]   And I'm not that connected with that sort of upper echelon of Apple.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.800]   And I sort of expected this.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.640]   It wasn't a huge shock to me.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:52.400]   Well, I think despite all the battling between people like fake Steve Jobs, Dan Lyons, and
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.960]   Jim Goldman, really the most important thing is Steve's health.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   And we wish him the best.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.520]   And there's no question that this industry has benefited more from Steve's presence than
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.320]   almost-- well, I can't think of anybody who's made more of a difference in this industry.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.640]   He created the personal computer.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.440]   It was one thing for Waz to invent it.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.560]   And a lot of people were making personal computers at that time.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.920]   It's another thing entirely to productize it, to make it a success.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.440]   And Steve gets full credit for that.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.000]   Waz always said that any time he'd invent something, the first thing out of Steve's mouth
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.640]   is, hmm, I think we can make a business out of this.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.800]   He knew how to do that.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.080]   He did it again and completely destroyed the music industry with the iPod.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.400]   Wasn't the first MP3 player.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   He made it.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   He saved it.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.600]   He saved the music industry.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   But he destroyed--
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600]   And then he bolted them in.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.960]   He burned it down to build it.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.240]   And I think he's done the same thing with the iPhone.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.000]   And I think that, again, it wasn't the first smartphone.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.400]   And I think you can credit-- mentally, he's brought in people like Johnny Ive, who's made
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   really designed this stuff.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.680]   But you can credit Steve with saying product, this is the product, this is the vision, this
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.880]   is the path.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.840]   And he is going to be missed if for nothing else, not so much from Apple, but just from
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.520]   the industry as a whole, as one of the guys who really can make things happen.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.480]   And I think that it's one of the things that they're the same.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.000]   Oftentimes, if you're one step ahead of everyone else, you're a leader.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.240]   If you're two steps ahead, you're a martyr.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   And I think that--
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.800]   He knows exactly how many steps he needs.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.280]   I think one thing Steve's very good at as being that leader, where he's just a step
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.280]   out ahead, he waits.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.000]   A lot of us will get frustrated.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.160]   Like, I asked for that phone for--
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.480]   I was like, oh, I want the phone for two years.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.920]   Every time I talk to someone at Apple, I was like, when do we get a phone?
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.840]   And I stopped-- and so we have to wait for things because Apple's looking at what everybody
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.680]   else does, let's them be the martyr.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.440]   Figures out from them what is working, and then steps in with the right solution oftentimes.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   Right.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   Yeah, that's a lot of--
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.280]   Excuse me, we've already handed a lot.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:48.720]   Japan was sort of-- or back in the day when all the massive innovation was happening, Japan
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.640]   would look at the rest of the world and see what they were doing and say, how can we streamline
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.760]   that and make it better and productize it?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:06.960]   Regarding the Apple presence at the show, I've got a photograph of the Apple booth at high
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.920]   tide when the traffic was everywhere and there were four people at the booth in all of them
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.520]   were Apple employees.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.000]   When was that?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.800]   During the show, there was like the floor was crowded with people, look over at the booth
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.400]   and actually, Liana Lehue, it took the picture and she said it to me and I was like, you're
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   kidding me.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   I don't understand.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.560]   Why was there no one there?
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   I don't know.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.920]   There were four Apple employees there and it was kind of an other--
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   That's bizarre.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   It looked like the--
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   That's bizarre.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   I put it up on my Flickr account.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:41.080]   It looks like sort of the-- you would imagine the deck of the Imperial Starship looks like
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.520]   all black with a bunch of computers and four people sort of hovering around but nobody
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   else there.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   Nobody there.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.520]   They're getting ready to invade.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.680]   Apparently, that's not a big deal that they're at the show given the attendance I saw.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.880]   But I think regarding that, people come to Macworld to be part of the Mac community
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.320]   and it's not necessarily-- Steve is important for the keynote and I think the keynote is
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   a highlight for a lot of people.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.600]   What percent gets into the keynote?
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   I think it's 3%.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   I didn't realize that.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.960]   The rest of us are just there to experience it and see what else is new.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   Fast can the globe.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.760]   I think most of them came to meet you, Lisa.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.240]   Aw, thanks.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.520]   Andy and Aco, what's your thought on all this?
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.720]   How important is Steve Jobs to the future of Apple?
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.160]   Well, he's never been Walt Disney.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   I mean--
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   That's a good analogy.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.280]   So you don't think he's the Walt Disney of Apple?
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:42.520]   Well, I mean, people have the same opinion of Walt Disney that a lot of people have of
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   Steve Jobs.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.960]   Disney was never-- he was a decent artist but he really wasn't on the same level as other
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   people.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.720]   And his job was to basically steer the Disney Corporation into the directions that it needs
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   to go.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:02.120]   When he identifies a product or a movie that needs to be made, it was his job to allow
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.720]   the people who make that movie to make that movie and to make them feel important and
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   to urge to the rest of the industry that this is exactly where we need to go.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.360]   We need to make movies in color.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.640]   We need to have a better sound experience.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.560]   We need to expand beyond simply making movies and develop properties that could be making
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.640]   money for us even when the movie is not actually airing it, airing or screening anywhere.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.920]   His job's power has always been to basically not to invent the iPod but to realize that
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.520]   an iPod needs to be invented.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.920]   When someone comes to him and says, "Here's an idea for a product."
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.840]   He's the guy who says, "You are now the most important thing going on in this company.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.400]   Waste anything except for time.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.000]   Let's get this on the market."
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.920]   But at the same point, he is the guy who takes a look at the entire story that Apple is
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:53.640]   telling and makes sure that nothing extraneous enters the dialogue, enters the storyline.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.320]   I have no doubt that there have been incredibly fantastic products that have been developed
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.680]   at Apple but never actually allowed to be released and to the unending frustration of
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.080]   the engineers who designed them.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:12.200]   I'm also certain that the reason the job's biggest influence has been allowing a boring
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.080]   phone not to be released or something that is great in and of itself but really doesn't
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.840]   fit in with anything else.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:24.360]   If Apple created just a box that does nothing but stream content from the internet onto
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.920]   your TV, that would have been an interesting little device and it would cost 100 bucks.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.800]   It would have been released and come out for about three months and we never would have
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.240]   heard about it as opposed to developing the Apple TV, which is a different version of
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.760]   an Apple computer that's totally rethought for a device that plugs into your plasma TV.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.480]   Similarly, the iPhone would have been easy to just OEM, a smartphone, add in whatever
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   firmware is necessary to make it compatible with content from the iTunes Store.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.680]   That's not what they wanted to make.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.960]   They wanted to make a device that made sense as an Apple product.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.480]   So that is really the deficiency that Steve Jobs will leave behind.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.240]   If Apple turns into a free for all of saying, "Look, we need a great..."
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.200]   So it gets some really great attention.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.160]   We need a great product that really creates a lot of attention.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.360]   I know let's develop that knowledge now navigator from that video 20 years ago.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.560]   We'll have a screen that folds in two and it'll look like a three-ring binder and it'll
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.920]   have a guy in a bow tie who talks to us and it'll be really, really cool and unfortunately
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.680]   that's the path that Microsoft tends to go down.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.360]   Microsoft has their big CES keynote about the week before Apple has theirs and it is
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.080]   traditional for them to show something really cool, really exciting, like wireless refrigerator
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.320]   magnets that tell you the temperature in in in in Kazil from your kitchen or a tabletop
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.280]   computer that costs $10,000 and it's about the size of a billiard table but also does
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.040]   cool things and it's a great demo and it's a great keynote and then you say, "Wow, well,
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.640]   when we get to buy this, well, we're still thinking about it."
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.440]   And there's a half-hearted attempt to bring it to market and you never actually, you know,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.040]   disappears without a trace.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   That's not Apple.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.200]   There's always been about a small, lean cast of characters that each support each other.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.440]   There's no product in Apple's product line that does not in some way enhance or support
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.680]   every other product in Apple's product line and that is the vacuum that Steve Jobs will
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   leave behind.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:24.280]   If we go back to that one guy who understands Apple and can say no to really cool objects
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.800]   but there are nothing more than really cool objects, Apple will do just fine.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.480]   When did you work at Apple, Fred?
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.760]   Oh, man, it was like five years ago.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   What were you doing?
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.800]   Doing books and prints for iPhoto and iPhoto product marketing?
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.360]   By the way, my holiday card, my Christmas card was an iPhoto card.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.800]   We're sending it now.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.760]   So my fingerprints are on that.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   [laughter]
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.440]   It really is.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.160]   That was an awesome smart thing for them to do.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.680]   So now that architecture is the sort of print architecture behind Aperture as well.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   Right.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   Oh, is it?
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   Oh, nah.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   Oh, that's really...
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   It migrated in that direction.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.680]   It seems like a lot of Aperture stuff went to iPhoto.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.160]   You know, Apple print services and things all the same.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   It's all the same.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   Bring up anything on top of that leverage.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.200]   We're going to talk more about Steve Jobs and also of other Apple news including an iPhone
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.400]   application that was used during the inauguration that just blew my mind.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.640]   But before we do that, I want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.000]   Audible is the place to go for audio books of all kinds, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.400]   That's the URL to use if you want to take advantage of our special deal.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.560]   Go there and you get a free credit toward a book.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.520]   And I say it that way because some books are more than one credit.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.120]   Almost all of them are one credit though.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.040]   51,000 titles on audible.com.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.640]   Books, radio shows, podcast, comedy performances.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.600]   Just amazing range of stuff.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.320]   I'm a big fan of audible.com.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.000]   And we encourage you to try it.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.920]   If you like listening as you obviously do because you're listening right now, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.680]   Oh, they've updated their page.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.440]   It's got a new front page.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.440]   Wow.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   Look at that.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.040]   They were talking about, they were a little hobbled by the platform that they were on.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   It limited a little bit of what they could do.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.080]   And I think that they were talking about moving into that.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.480]   Maybe they have moved to their new platform now.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.720]   Andy, what are you reading these days on audible?
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:25.400]   Right now I'm still in the middle of Mr. Norrell, the book I recommended because it's
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   a hell of a long book.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.400]   Do you like it?
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.240]   Are you standing with a recommendation?
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.920]   I'm standing with that recommendation.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.960]   See, sometimes now, eagle-eared listeners will sometimes realize that, wait, I've
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   knit it.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.640]   He keeps recommending a different 23-hour book a week.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.960]   Does he do nothing but sit in his car idling?
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.640]   Do we know with his power book and his laugh?
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.400]   Nothing but working in the car, listen to audible books.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.160]   So sometimes I'm recommending stuff that I'm actually listening to right now.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.800]   Sometimes I'm recommending a book that I have read in the past or listened to in the past.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.160]   And that is this week's recommendation.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:05.720]   We had a significant literary death for people who like authors who do that really tricky
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.600]   trick of making lawyers sound interesting and impressive.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:17.680]   John Mortimer created a character of Horace Rumpel, the barrister of the High Court.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.760]   And most people are more aware of the PBS series.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.760]   Yeah, which is wonderful.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.760]   Right.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.640]   And as a matter of fact, he created a character for memory serves, memory serves going from
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.120]   the obituary that I read a few days ago.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.600]   It was created for a BBC radio drama.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.040]   And he decided he started writing short stories and books based on the character.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.080]   Rumpel of the Bailey was the name of the show.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.160]   Rumpel of the Bailey, right.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.920]   About a guy who actually, whose career actually sort of paralleled Mortimer's.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   He was, he was a lawyer who was, who was especially interested in free speech cases.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:59.640]   He was, his obit is just dotted with famous cases in the 60s and 70s of basically the
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.480]   crown telling someone that they can't say or publish something.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.160]   And Mortimer saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, he can say that.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.960]   He can say that perfectly fine.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.000]   Now I will say one thing.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.760]   His short stories tend to work better than there.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.280]   The whole one, he wrote about a dozen books.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.040]   I've read a couple of the short stories.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.520]   I have never read one of the longer books.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.240]   And I think that that's probably correct.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:27.560]   I've talked to other people who said that in long form, in long form, the stories tend
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.040]   to repeat themselves and run out of steam.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.120]   I can't certify that myself, but that's the impression I get that this is very much a
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.640]   short story type of author and a short story type of character.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.480]   And they have a one book on Audible Rumpel on trial, which is nothing but Rumpel's short
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   stories.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.880]   Seven of them, seven of them, which are especially good in audio book format because, again,
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.520]   I'm right in the middle of a 23 hour book, which makes that sometimes short.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520]   Exactly.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.280]   I'm glad that like it's for the very first time I'm glad that my dad lives about an hour
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.280]   away.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.360]   So that means that, OK, great.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.560]   I will have at least four or five hours this week, which I can keep nibbling away at this
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.640]   book as I try to visit my dad.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.320]   But these are great for shorter distances.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   You can have an entire experience beginning, middle and end in one slightly extended little
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.600]   drive or one day's worth of errands.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.320]   And you've got seven of these, like all in one title.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.760]   And it takes you on a very, very wide arc or short stories.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   I've read two of these.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.440]   I've read Rumpel and the Children of the Devil.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:35.200]   And I did read Rumpel on trial, which is a lot of fun because it's one fans of series
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.560]   like house.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.920]   Always wonder, look, if this guy were a real doctor, he would have been banned.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.360]   He would have had a nice life in three days.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.080]   He would be in prison much less.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.320]   So it seems as though Rumpel on trial is the author sort of answering every single lawyer
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.840]   who ever wrote him a letter saying, OK, this is what would happen three, three seconds
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.200]   after Rumpel said this to a judge.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.760]   And so he essentially he has put on trial.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   Good.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.320]   For me, for me, for me.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   Yeah, I'm good.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.840]   Oh, that sounds so fun.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.360]   So it's it's it's good stuff eight hours and five minutes.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.240]   You're not exactly you're not totally sticking it to audible with with with with these one
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:20.480]   these great 24 30 hour recommendation so so in Twitter, that me and gave me a a 50 something
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.160]   hour novel that is actually very, very highly reviewed.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.040]   I don't know if I have the strength to actually download and listen to it.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.200]   50 hours 50 something hours.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.960]   What is that?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.800]   It's in it's in my wish list.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.200]   I don't want to hang on.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.920]   I'm actually going to click on it right now.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.240]   It's like the Spartans.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   The Spartans.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   It is not the Spartans.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   I look for books.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   I buy them by the by the hour.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.480]   You know, it's like buying books for the pound.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   Actually I clicked on the wrong one.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.960]   But yeah, it's a it's a it's a heroically long book.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.240]   Chef Chantaram, the unabridged version, normally 35 bucks.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   It will cost you only one credit if you're subscribed.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   Wow.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.240]   And it is 43 hours and three minutes long.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   That's a good deal.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.520]   If you if you pay by the minute, it's a good deal.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.520]   Exactly.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.520]   You're just concerned on price per tonnage.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.520]   This is definitely going to be your your your your your.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.840]   But meanwhile, but you know, our own Paul and trial eight hours.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.080]   That's a good that's a good length.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.520]   And that's a seven short stories, which I think is your right.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.480]   It's a good and again, I haven't I haven't actually listened to the audio book.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.800]   I have read a couple of these stories and that's I think that's exactly the right length
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.760]   for John Motormer and this character.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.800]   You good satisfying beginning, middle and end and then you're in the your driveway.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   Get gone with your life.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   Rump all on trial.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.240]   Our pick of the week, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.280]   It'll play on your iPhone, your iPod, many, many portable devices.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   Burn to CD.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   Listen on your computer.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.840]   It's a great way to get a lot of reading done.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   We love audible.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   We know you will too.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   Give them a try.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   Audible.com.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.840]   On your way to school.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.840]   When you can't read a book, don't be.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.840]   Get audible.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   What are you laughing at?
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.840]   That's a jingle, man.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   Thank you, dude.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   I didn't realize we had an audible.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   Hey, we got a worry.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.080]   I think Jeff Smith did that one.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.400]   I'm not sure, but I think that's who did that one.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.800]   See, that's why audible is a great company.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.160]   They're not one of these fancy pants publishers who insist that their customers know how to
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   read.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   No.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   Exactly.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.640]   We know, you know, I think text is so less entry.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:35.360]   Actually, I think that for an extra $1.20 a month, they will actually Twitter you an entire
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   book, 140 characters at a time.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.200]   There's people doing that.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.440]   Matt Richter, who wrote a book called Hooked, which was a really fun book.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.080]   I think he writes for the Chronicle.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.840]   It might be the New York Times, was Twittering a novel.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:56.200]   It was actually kind of cool because it was as if it were tweets from, you know, it was
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   like a CD hooker and stuff.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   It was really great.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   Do you remember that?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   It was really good.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   I don't know if he's still doing that.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   Did somebody say hooker?
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   Oh, stop it.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   I just, I'm sorry.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   I was sleeping.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   I heard the word hooker.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   Get on them all excited.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   I woke him up there.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   So wait a minute.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   I just want to know one thing.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   What?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   How can I get my own jingle?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.600]   Oh, hey, we should do shouts for everybody.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   It's time.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.000]   It's time for Mac Break, particularly with Scott Born.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   You know, a little chorus.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Oh, man, he is.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.480]   All right, Scott.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.000]   We will talk to Jam and Dallas as I get some jingles made for you.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   It would be kind of fun to have jingles, wouldn't it?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.320]   Well, I mean, actually, come on.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   That was great.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.000]   That reminded me of the good old days, you know?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   This whole show reminds me of the good old days.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And if we don't.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   It's all but it's best to go out for you, Scott.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Yeah, it's got the weather.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Jingle, this is one of theme songs.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Shaft or something like that.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Who's the man who woke up at Van?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I'm talking about Van.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   That's what I want right there.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   He's the man.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And I want it on my phone.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   That was good.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Van the man.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   So I've been, I watched some of the inauguration on and it's a competitor of our streaming service.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   So I'm going to say this with trepidation Ustream.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Ustream.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   We're on stick am for our video.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Stickam.com.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Ustream.tv is one of the competing services.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   They set up, they got an iPhone app out the door yesterday.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Free iPhone app.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Someone was burning the midnight oil getting that one.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Man.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And they had the inauguration on it and I watched part of it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   A lot of buffering, the quality was fine.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Looked, well, still on there.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   I'll show you.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   The quality is fine.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   108,000 people at the peak, I think.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Wow.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   It was an amazing thing.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   But it does seem to buffer every, say minute or two for a few seconds, but not badly.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And the video's decent.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   You can chat.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I want this application for stickam.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   This is pretty amazing.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   So this is the first company I think that's done streaming video on the iPhone.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Now, it's receive only.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Does it turn sideways?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Same frame.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   It doesn't change.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   What's the app called, Leo?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I think it's just search for Ustream on the app store.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   I think it's Ustream.tv.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   But I was very impressed.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Now, some people were saying, well, when is Ustream going to make an app that will allow you to stream?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   I've had for a while the quick pre-release.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   If people have been able to jailbreak their iPhone and put quick on it, quick set streaming
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   video, they sent me the pre-release of what they hope to get in the store.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   They haven't yet.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And it's great.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I stream the Jonathan Colton concert on Saturday.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   I think the iPhone is perfectly capable of sending video.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And that's amazing quality.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   What you think?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Yeah, that's not bad.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   In fact, if I hadn't known about that, I would have been here a little earlier.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   You could have driven up.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   You already know how to plug into your driving over the Golden Gate Bridge looking and looking
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   and then we would have been Fred had twittering.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And texting.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Here's the bad news.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Unfortunately, it's Wi-Fi only.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   So you can't use it on Edge or a 3G, which is a shame because it would be that.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And you can do the audio.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   You know, our audio works fine on Edge or 3G, but even on Edge.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   But they're requiring Wi-Fi.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Have you found the quick app works well?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   I mean, I've been using it for a while and I've had a little bit of difficulties with
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   it.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Sometimes it'll cut out and.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   It's buffering all.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   You know, I recorded one whole quote and song that I thought was on the air and it never
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   was on the air.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   It was just it was buffered the whole thing.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   But on the other hand, when it works, it works.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   If you go to qik.com/twit, you can see some of the stuff I've sent.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   It works as well on the iPhone as it does on any other platform.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Let's put it that way.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Right.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Certainly the iPhone is capable of doing it.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   It heats up pretty good.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It's doing a lot of processing power.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It goes through the battery.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   You want to have a mophie or one of those fast tracks I talked about last week because
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   that you're going to need the battery juice.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   But no, it does a pretty good job.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   So I think we're going to think it's probably why it's not activated.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I mean, I think that I think the video is not because it can't do it is because Apple knows
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   that if people started using their video, they'd tune that battery down real quick.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   You know, I was at the concert and I met somebody I don't I won't mention his name who works
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.680]   on the iPhone software team.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.160]   And I said, dude, what did you do with 2.2?
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   That thing's amazing.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.000]   He said, yeah, pretty good.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   The battery life improvement is dramatic.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   It's dramatic.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.680]   It works, but it's true.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.720]   And then I said, and I've been playing this new game.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.680]   This is the I-Mob game.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   Have you been playing that?
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   No.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   Where you get mobbed up.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.600]   It's kind of a take off on the MySpace mob game, but it seems to kill the battery real
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   quick.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   And I think it's because it keeps--
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   For a good reason.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   I mobbed online.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.000]   I think it's because it keeps the radio on all the time because it's always your always
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   it's an online game.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   I know.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.280]   I really only have to with with my mophie, I only have to charge maybe like once a week,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.240]   you know, to, you know, because there's somewhere in the middle of the week, I'll pop the mophie
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.240]   and run it.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.400]   But that's about it.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   But I don't have Wi-Fi on 90% of the time because that's the thing that just chews up
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   the battery life.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.400]   Well, maybe go ahead.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   Sorry.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.200]   Have you tried all of the malics?
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.480]   Because I mean, everyone's been talking about the fast mac one and the mophie and the
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.480]   ricki.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   The fast mac is really great.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.520]   I think I charged it fully, the phone fully on it, and it only uses like a fraction of
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.520]   the total charge.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.120]   Yeah, I think that the fast mac, I think that the fast mac is actually overall for all the
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.080]   features that you get and the length of charge and everything else.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.440]   I think it's actually better in that respect than the mophie.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.040]   It's just that it's not, the mophie is a lot smaller and I just want something that I can
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.640]   pop in my jeans pocket and I just feel like the fast mac.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.640]   Little bit bigger than the other one.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.800]   The other one that we talked about is the Richard Solo 18.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.640]   The new one is I think 1800 milliwatt, a little bit, a little bit.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.440]   And that has a laser pointer on it.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.840]   All these frickin' laser beams.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   Yeah, frickin'!
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   Well, that's really small because it doesn't, it doesn't really, it's not intended to be
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   a case.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   Right.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   It just docks.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.200]   You don't want, I mean, I like the fact that what I really like about it is dropping
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.480]   it into a case and then going about my business with it on and then pulling it off and not
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   having to add anything.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.080]   And so on the run I think that, and I want to test all of them.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.200]   It's one of those things we should do is we should get them all in here and test them
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   and test them.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   Hmmm.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   You know, for me they serve different purposes.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   Lisa, you use a mophie, don't you?
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.720]   No, I don't.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   I don't use anything in fact.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.760]   She charges her phone.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   She's responsible.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.440]   Yeah, I have a dock, a Griffin Dock and it has two spots.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.360]   So I put my iPhone and then my iPod there.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360]   That's the nice thing about the fast mac.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   I said, "Little USB port on it."
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.880]   So you can charge something else.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.920]   Did you, don't you find that that quick just kills the battery like crazy?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920]   Yes, yes.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.080]   Actually, when I was in San Francisco I realized that I really needed something like the mophie
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:42.880]   and then, and Justine covered the fast mac and stole it right from under me.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.040]   Oh, man.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.920]   And she was like, "Ooh, look at the light."
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   And I'm like, "Yeah, that's great.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   I didn't get one."
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080]   [laughter]
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.360]   Lisa's clever though.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.800]   She showed us when she was on here last week how she got the Mimo bought by begging.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   So I didn't.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   I didn't.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   Bagging.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.880]   I don't know why you couldn't have begged the fast mac guys for one.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.480]   I bought the fast mac.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   How much is it?
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.560]   It's like 80 books.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.400]   That's another way to get it.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   Oh.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   Buying.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   Come on now.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.200]   What is this purchase you speak?
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   Scott.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   What would require money?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   Well, I didn't actually personally go do it.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   Someone went and did it on my behalf.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   I had my men go get.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.400]   My squire picked one up.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.280]   And I have to say, the best feature about it bar none is the little light you can use
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.560]   as a key light for portraits.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   I like that.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.160]   It's 79 bucks.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.040]   And if you're using quick having that fast mac and the light on there right next to the
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.760]   camera, I haven't tried it, but I think that would be actually--
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.320]   It does add significantly to the heft of the iPhone.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   That's why I'll keep it on there.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.480]   It makes it less pocket friendly.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:54.280]   But I've never really had trouble keeping my iPhone going all day because I don't do
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.600]   half the stuff you guys do.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.000]   I don't have any fart apps, for instance, on that.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.520]   I took it off the old fashioned way.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   I took it off.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.120]   Although, did you see that was it twinkle that added the fart sound?
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.680]   Just in case you were tweeting.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   Tweety.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   Tweety.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.840]   The thing is, the digital will never have the warmth and saturation of an online.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.280]   You did not use the word saturation.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:20.400]   Somehow, I feel like that's the lead to an article.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.480]   I have that feeling somehow.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.880]   That's a word Smith right there.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   All right.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.080]   Actually, this is-- as long as I'm talking about iPhone apps, Tweety is the newest hot
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.840]   ticket in iPhone Twitter apps.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   I use me too.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   Is that better?
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   Twitter-ific?
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.840]   I find it a lot more responsive.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.720]   I was using twinkle.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   And I've been con--
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.400]   I couldn't use Tweety.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.880]   So, Tweety does not have the lovely twinkle interface, but it has many of the other features.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.720]   But it's the only one I know that has search and trends.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.080]   The trends button is really very cool.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.320]   So you can see what topics are trending up on Twitter.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   I like the fact that it's a nice-- it has a combination of lots of features, but a simple
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.360]   streamlined, uncluttered interface when all you want to do is just see what your friends
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.920]   are saying or just see what people have said in response to your tweets.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   I mean, I have a rather-- a lot of us have a rather ambitious use of Twitter.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.440]   And so there are a lot of apps that will do simplicity.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.960]   There are a lot of apps that will do complexity, but I think that Tweety is the only one that
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.440]   really manages both them well.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.880]   Although it does-- wow.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:36.160]   It commits one of those huge cardinal sins of user interface design that you bet-- you
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.760]   guys, if you created-- if you had any hand in this application, you better pray that
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.440]   Steve Jobs has never seen this app because otherwise he's headed to your town with a
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   baseball bat.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   OK, wait a minute.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   Don't tell us.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   Let's all guess.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   What's wrong?
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   I don't know.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   What's wrong?
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   I'm looking at it.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.800]   There's some cardinal UI flyer.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.120]   There is a functional button.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.960]   Oh, I know what he's talking about.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   That does not appear until you scroll the main viewer pane and scroll it into exactly.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.040]   The reload button is a fundamental button, a fundamental function.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.200]   It should be up at the top, left corner of the screen.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.600]   Someplace where it can be seen.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.200]   You're not supposed to have user interface elements that simply scroll--
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.560]   Steve Fred knew that because he worked for Steve Jobs.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   He knows.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.200]   I knew that because driving up here, trying to read my Twitter.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.840]   And to scroll up to hit the reload button.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840]   Well, it's not that hard.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.680]   OK, so I'm going to disagree.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.520]   I think it's nice that it's not there because it doesn't take up space.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.680]   All you have to do is go one thing up and press it.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   That's not so bad.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   That's not so bad.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.400]   So again, look at the top left corner of that title bar with your account name.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.160]   There's nothing there.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.720]   You could easily put a refresh button up there and not clutter anything up.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.960]   Not take up any extra space.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   The idea that--
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.240]   I guess if I tapped Leo LaPort, it should just refresh there.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.080]   Also, there are times when I just want to see what's-- people have posted 130 things
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.200]   in my followers list since the last time I checked.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.080]   I don't want to have to scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll to the refresh
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   button.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.800]   I want to say, just show me what's going on in the past five or ten minutes.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.200]   I have to say, this is the only Twitter iPhone app I know of that allows you to have multiple
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   accounts.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   Yes.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.800]   And that's handy for me because I have several personalities.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.000]   Lisa, you got mostly Lisa back.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.480]   I did, and it was the greatest moment.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.400]   It was a great internet success.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.280]   Have you abandoned Lisa Bettany on Twitter?
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.080]   Are you just mostly Lisa now?
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   I--
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.680]   Or do they merge the two?
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.960]   No, I kept-- I had to start Lisa Bettany again.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.960]   And--
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.120]   So they turned Lisa Bettany into mostly Lisa?
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.120]   Yes.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.760]   And then you started Lisa Bettany.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   Oh, my followers.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.800]   And so it was really great.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.160]   But then I think some people got confused and they would go to Lisa Bettany.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.000]   So I just kept that and it's just sort of redirecting people.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.560]   Although, people are still following that empty account.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.800]   Isn't that confusing?
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.440]   But I mean, at least now, it's sort of like--
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   How did you get it?
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.320]   How did you get it back?
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.560]   Well, when we were talking on Twitter,
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.320]   one of my friends just sent an email to Twitter.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.760]   And they responded right away.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.480]   I mean, I've been writing them for--
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.000]   You're kidding.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.800]   Oh, one of your friends must have some clout.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.840]   I don't know.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.880]   It was just like a general tech person.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   I think maybe--
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.640]   I think maybe they mentioned that Lisa's
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.360]   been bitching about it on Twitter.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.400]   I'd like to be that guy.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.880]   I'm the general tech person.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.040]   There was no name.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.280]   It was just admin.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.880]   So I can't even thank the person that did it.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.640]   Well, thank you, admin.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.160]   Thank you.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.680]   I love the stuff.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.920]   Well, let's--
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.880]   We appreciate it.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.760]   And of course, the person who had the bad password at Twitter
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.880]   that allowed the hacker to hack our accounts,
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.160]   we know her name.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.000]   She ain't no admin.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.120]   They put that name out.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.800]   Then keep that one anonymous.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   Oh, really?
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.920]   Yeah, crystal.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   And you know what her password was?
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.080]   Happiness.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.360]   And in the hacker-- no, the hacker brute forced it.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.200]   He had a little program he'd written that would just--
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.000]   and the real flaw wasn't crystals.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.040]   I mean, it was bad having a dictionary word password.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.480]   But the real flaw was that Twitter allowed you just
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.520]   to keep trying.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.040]   Keep trying.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:21.680]   Nope, that's not it.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.520]   Nope, nope, keep trying.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:22.960]   Keep trying.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.240]   Nope, nope, keep trying.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.680]   And he tried all night, everywhere in the dictionary,
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.360]   until he came to happiness.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.200]   And it worked.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.560]   And he woke.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.400]   He said, I woke up and look, I was in.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.440]   I have admin access.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.480]   And then you know what he did with that?
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.360]   He went to-- this is a fascinating story.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.200]   And credit to Kevin Polson at Wired for getting this story.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.480]   He actually talked to the guy.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.680]   He went to a hacker forum and said,
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.600]   I don't know what to do with this.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.520]   I've got admin access to Twitter.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.560]   Anybody want an account?
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.920]   And so on the forum, the guy said, guys, some guy--
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.360]   I'll take Barrocks.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.720]   I'll take Kevin Rose.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.320]   I'll take-- I want Brittany.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.160]   And so all of the-- and mine too.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.200]   And all of the accounts went.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.360]   And of course on Barack Obama's account,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.080]   they posted, get 500 gallons free gas, take this survey.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.600]   And I think Barack would have posted that.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.240]   I thought that was pretty reasonable.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.520]   He might have thought of that.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.200]   No.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   They didn't hack my account.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.360]   But Brittany Spears, they really hacked aboard Brittany.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   Oh.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.360]   Ouch.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.680]   And Rick Sanchez and Fox News.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.320]   So Obama has Twittered.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.880]   And he put up a couple of tweets, not from the Oval Office
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.960]   yet, and probably not actually--
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.480]   I probably wasn't procc typing this on his BlackBerry,
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.600]   which apparently he's keeping.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.800]   But he put up a Twitter yesterday saying,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.160]   it's Martin Luther King's birthday, day of national service.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.960]   Go to usaservice.org, which I did.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.520]   To--
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.560]   He would have been great though this morning to have--
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.480]   in the limo on the way.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.160]   It's cold out here.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.760]   And that Joe Biden shoes more deodorant,
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.760]   something like that.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   Exactly.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   That would have been funny.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.600]   He should have twittered his inaugural address
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.360]   140 characters at a time.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.760]   And time, man.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.120]   Just someone said they're going send send send.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.760]   And he just goes up on his clothes captioning.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.640]   I was sort of half expecting him in the middle of the inaugural
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   address here.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.960]   And he just simply checks his BlackBerry,
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.840]   retweets, puts it back in his pocket, keeps on going.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.600]   Chris Saka, who's an entrepreneur, apparently got an audience
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.640]   with Obama yesterday.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.760]   And unless he's making this up-- and I don't think he is,
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.240]   because he's actually there--
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.000]   he said he talked to Barack.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   He said, are you going to use your Twitter account?
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.880]   And he's quoting Barack.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.560]   He says, I hear your tweets loud and clear.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.680]   And he agrees he needs to get back to Twittering again.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.760]   How does the president of the United States
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.360]   use this kind of social network?
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.120]   I mean, I think that one of the primary uses
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.680]   of the president of the Oval Office is as a bully pulpit.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.520]   It is more than anything else.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.640]   It is more than policy more than anything else.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.480]   It is pushing--
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.440]   Teddy Roosevelt's words.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.760]   --quishing the politics one way or the other
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   through communication.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.080]   And by using stuff like YouTube, but especially using stuff
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.480]   like Twitter, I mean, he kept-- if he actually gave us
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.280]   two or three Twitter's a day, he'd have a million followers
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.120]   on Twitter.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.080]   And you can cause a lot of damage with a million followers.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.800]   Well, they are a lot of good at Alex Gwen.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   No, no, no.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.880]   But what I mean is that you can say everyone show up here
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.720]   and do this thing or--
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.320]   Well, they say everyone go help someone today do this.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   Another vehicle.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.600]   He has millions of names on a mailing list, on text messages.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.680]   And they've already said, we plan to use those.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.640]   If Congress balks at one of our proposals,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.040]   send an email out saying, hey, do you
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.000]   want to support Barack right your member of Congress?
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.200]   I mean, we want to put it in perspective.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.520]   When people are watching this--
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.840]   when people are watching Twitter,
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.440]   which has got a lot of live viewers--
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.920]   when we were doing the iPhone coverage at 8,000--
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.120]   at 8,000, when we mentioned the website, it went down.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.640]   And that was only 8,000.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.160]   You're talking about 100,000, 200,000, 300,000.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.280]   You start focusing people like that on their Congress,
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.520]   on their Congress people.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.720]   And things will get real intense real fast.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.440]   You know, nothing--
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:14.760]   his requests will make everything else pale in comparison.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.520]   That means we're going to need more of those tube things.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.640]   We need more monkeys.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.440]   I think that you could easily bring down any site
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.720]   that you mentioned if you've tweeted it.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.240]   Barack Obama tweeted it.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.520]   We've seen that right here.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.960]   We could bring down any site just by mentioning it on Twitter.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.840]   Let's just do it for fun, Leo.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.040]   ScottCretiques.com.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.320]   Everybody go there now.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.440]   Scott-- [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.320]   I don't see if it made it.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.280]   Scott doesn't mind.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:42.840]   So that's a--
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.520]   I'd be happy for that problem.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.640]   I can call my friends at Gogrid and say,
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.840]   build me another server now.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.320]   Well, that's why I was impressed by Ustream
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   being able to serve 108,000 streams through an iPhone.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.400]   That's kind of a breakthrough.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.840]   It's the first time since YouTube that somebody's
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.040]   created a video application.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.320]   Now, how are they doing that?
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.840]   There's no flash on this thing, right?
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.840]   It's got to be H.264 streaming.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.920]   Now, is that legal?
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.800]   I mean, like--
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.960]   Well, it's within the cap.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.000]   I guess it is legal.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.440]   It's looking at a web interface.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.880]   It's H.264.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.960]   So they crack the door for the rest of the video, folks,
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.680]   to start their own.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.280]   Yeah, I think that you should be--
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   it's just the only reason a lot of the other video folks
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.320]   haven't had that is because they've been streaming Flash.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.640]   So by streaming, it's just for--
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.800]   So would you have to create a second QuickTime-based stream
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.520]   with a QuickTime stream?
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.600]   I don't know if you have to.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.120]   To me, it would be the easiest way to do it.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.960]   Somebody said, when I mentioned this,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.840]   somebody twittered back to me, well, Flash, the FLV
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:43.920]   is just a wrapper around something that's either VP6 or H.264.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.160]   And that's what QuickTime is.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:45.880]   QuickTime is a wrapper.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.880]   It's a wrapper.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.720]   FLV is a wrapper.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.960]   So there's H.264-- let's say H.264 underneath there.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.680]   Couldn't you take the existing Flash stream and somehow--
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.400]   To me, it seems like it would be easier.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.440]   If I was doing it for 108,000 people,
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.360]   I would feed the raw data into two servers--
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.200]   one that's serving the Flash on the web
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.520]   and one that was serving the H.264 direct to the phone.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.360]   You use streams using Akamai.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.120]   It's expensive to have a second Akamai stream.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:16.880]   Very expensive.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.400]   Highly expensive.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.960]   We're going to have two different streams no matter what,
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.520]   because I don't--
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.600]   I think it's you have to.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.000]   I think you'd end up having to--
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.080]   Unless your application is able to receive a stream--
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.580]   Right.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.680]   And then unwrap it.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.400]   I'm very interested in how they did this.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:30.880]   We should--
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.720]   Partly because I'd like Stick Yeah in the company.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.640]   This stream is bested.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.200]   It's like, let's talk to them and figure it out.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.560]   Can we do construction technology
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.480]   to give it to you?
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.120]   Because I would very much like to have that same--
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.360]   And it's one of the-- if I would say,
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.720]   what is the most requested thing from our audience?
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.240]   I want to see the live stream on the phone.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.280]   And we focused for the first three years
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.560]   on Twitter on downloadable audio.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:00.440]   And it's still by far our biggest product by a lot.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.120]   This show has 75,000 downloads and only 2,000 people
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.160]   watching on the video.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.520]   But I think increasingly--
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.680]   especially if you could put it on things
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.640]   like the iPhone and other phones--
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.600]   increasingly the live stream is what people are going to want.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   Because I think people get backed up with too many podcasts
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.240]   on their iPod.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.280]   They go, I can't keep up.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.240]   And they eventually give up.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   Whereas a stream, you just tune in when you want.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.360]   You don't turn in when you don't want.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.760]   Now, is there a live stream of Macbreak Weekly?
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.120]   Live audio stream.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.880]   Well, we're live audio streaming it right now, yeah.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.520]   But it's small.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.560]   That's a small audience.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.520]   Part many people are right now, Leo.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.120]   On the video or the audio?
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:32.880]   Both.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.240]   The video is 2,000 some, which is--
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.240]   remember, this is noon rtime 3 p.m.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.360]   East Coast time is the name.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   It's-- a lot of people can't listen.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.440]   Let me log into the--
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.600]   because I just got 1,280 logins.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.440]   It's got critiques.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.360]   So much everybody watching.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.640]   Thank you.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.080]   Oh, my god.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.720]   Did you buy yourself one of those really tight black teachers
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.880]   from the gap, like Simon Cowell wears?
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.200]   Not really.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   No.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:00.720]   No.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.960]   Let me see if I can log in.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.600]   I can't remember the administrator password.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.000]   So I am going to buy one of those for Lisa
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.920]   and have her model for the site, maybe.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.080]   Actually, I could see.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.360]   It's a 100% up on that.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.640]   178 people listening on the audio stream,
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.200]   we peaked at about 200.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.000]   That was probably earlier, because we
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.880]   rebroadcast the inauguration.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.560]   Do it again, Leo.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.120]   Do it again.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.320]   So that's actually-- that's a larger number
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.160]   than we've had in the past.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.840]   I think more and more people are listening to the audio.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   So it's like--
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.440]   I know that every time that you were gone,
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.080]   remember when you were in China,
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.200]   and we would tweet about, you know,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   we're going to do Mac Break Weekly anyway,
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.160]   and Alex was letting everybody know who he's going to run
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:35.960]   the show.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.760]   I got a fair amount of Twitter traffic back saying,
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.240]   are you guys going to do a live feed?
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.000]   And we had to disappoint and say, no.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.640]   I think-- you know, well, remember, people demand--
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.280]   you can't judge demand, you know, when you-- when they do
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.920]   surveys about television, everybody says, oh, PBS.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.440]   I watch PBS all the time.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.160]   It's actually the--
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:55.640]   I do actually watch--
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   I do actually.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.440]   Yes, all the time.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.800]   People-- there's an aspirational thing.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.720]   There's people say, I will listen and watch live streaming
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.360]   that they don't end up doing that.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.120]   But I have a feeling that applications like putting,
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.960]   you know, this Ustream on an iPhone, you know,
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.920]   if we could have-- if we could have this show streaming live
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.000]   on an iPhone, I think we'd double or triple our audience.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.360]   So--
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.480]   I mean, it'd be huge.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.320]   Yeah, so I think that this is becoming--
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.920]   more and more, this is becoming the way.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   It's still not 75,000, but hey, in five--
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.720]   two years maybe it might be, you know?
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.760]   I just-- I see people moving that way,
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.920]   because there's too much information.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.040]   If you start downloading all the podcasts and the news feeds
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.080]   and so forth, I've given up on RSS.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:32.680]   I don't read it.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.320]   I was-- it's funny, I was talking to Veronica Belma
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.920]   and Ryan Block of Engadget.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.240]   I'm sorry, I have GDGT a couple of nights ago.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.360]   And I asked him, do you still read news feeds?
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.400]   And for the generally, most people do not read news feeds
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:45.800]   anymore.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.720]   Do you still pop out net newswire and read all those feeds?
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.600]   Well, I mean, that's how I-- actually, that's my morning
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   ritual is what you do.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.120]   Well, I have on Safari, does it much better, in my opinion,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.600]   than Firefox, which is that it'll let--
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.520]   Safari is a great job.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.760]   I do-- I have-- I have about 20-- 20-- it's not feeds,
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.680]   but it's like, yo, it's the feeds from different sites
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.480]   that I like to go to.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.560]   So if I go to a site more than a couple times,
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.120]   I'll go ahead and add it to the feed.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.080]   But then I look at all of them stacked by date.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.440]   So it's just a mixture of Macworld and Wired and New York
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.400]   Times and everything else.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.240]   Do you read news on a newsreader?
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.120]   You know, I used to.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.560]   I used to use net newswire.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.320]   And I had-- it was growing and growing and growing.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.240]   And it just got to be unmanageable.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:23.520]   So--
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.320]   I give up.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.040]   I gave up.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.560]   It's over well.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.600]   Don't launch it anymore.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.560]   And now I went back to 1999 when
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.680]   I had a bunch of websites that I would just visit from time
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.640]   to time and get my news.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.320]   I do live feed from friend feed in the side of my browser
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.560]   or I watch Twitter.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.640]   And I figure anything important that breaks,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.320]   I'm going to see it on those.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.640]   And I think that that's-- this is what I call the--
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.160]   Robert Scobel actually was the first person I heard
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.760]   to use this term.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.960]   The real time web is really the future of this.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.240]   Because there's too much information.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.560]   If you start downloading it, you're overwhelmed.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.880]   We want to do it all in real time.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.120]   Why do I go down-- I just because you see the headlines.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.000]   And then I just click through it to where--
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.320]   So it is just surfing the web.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.600]   It's a glorified surfing.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.760]   Andy, do you still do news feeds or how do you gather news?
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.520]   It's all through reader.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.320]   Google News.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.520]   I mean, as a matter of fact, it's gotten a little bit out
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.600]   of hand now that I actually now have to have two
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.840]   or three different accounts.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.760]   One is all business.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   One is all business-- all the stuff that I follow
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.200]   because I want to try to at least keep up to date
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.800]   with everything that I need to write about.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.920]   One that's news that I as a person want to follow.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.440]   And then there's the cats with their heads and yogurt tins,
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.960]   photos feed.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.400]   This is the stuff that-- because I
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.600]   used to have all that in the same feed.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.760]   And you know how it is.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.320]   You get a really great blogger like Emma Kennedy.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.360]   And it's like, oh, wow, I missed eight different columns.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.600]   And I know that something's doing 45 minutes.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.680]   But I could spend 23 minutes of that reading new blog posts.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.400]   And then you're gone.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.240]   How about you, Lisa?
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.480]   How do you consume news?
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.200]   I listen to you guys.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.160]   That's what I want.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.440]   That was the politic answer.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.920]   But how do you really?
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.040]   I actually just-- yeah, I have sites that I go to.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.680]   And I actually rely a lot on Twitter.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.960]   Yeah, see, more and more, I think live things like Twitter
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.400]   are going to be the way people keep up on what's going on.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.320]   I think, well, it works great as an alerts service.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.960]   I mean, I'm a little bit embarrassed to say
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.200]   that there are times when-- not even just Twitter,
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.800]   but just the fact that I may not be checking the New York
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.160]   Times site every hour.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.280]   But even when I'm really busy, I'll check FARC.com.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.920]   Just for I'm really bored.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.760]   I need to keep moving.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.920]   But I need to keep at my keyboard.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.080]   But I need to take a five second break.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.360]   Well, FARC is kind of an example, like dig, of a--
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.400]   in a way like a Twitter, an aggregator that's kind of
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.600]   scrolling almost real time.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.080]   I mean, I don't go there for news.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.720]   But when something entire East Coast is on fire,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.680]   aliens consuming, the consuming, the wicked,
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.440]   and the righteous alike, I say, oh, wow,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.280]   that's a news flash.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.760]   That'll be on FARC.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.320]   Like, something has some really nasty stuff
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   has to be going down in order for an actual news story
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.200]   of actual importance to be greenlit on FARC.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.280]   All right, we're going to go to our picks in just a second.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   Our picks of the week--
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.720]   I didn't warn Fred and Lisa that we would expect that.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.880]   So you may begin typing.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.680]   I have a pick.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.240]   Oh, you're so with it.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.440]   You have many picks?
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.720]   You want to lend one to Fred?
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.560]   You guys can deal--
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.400]   I have a pick.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.000]   Behind you.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:23.600]   You have a pick?
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.240]   Oh, man.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:24.960]   You guys are ready.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.320]   No, I said, can I have a pick?
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:26.920]   Oh, he wants her.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.480]   Just pick up some--
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:27.880]   I'm picking--
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   I'm picking--
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880]   I'm picking--
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.880]   Please.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.960]   Pick word for pick.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.360]   We're going to mention our good friends at Drobo,
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.200]   who bring you this show.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.880]   Drobo, of course, we all love.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.680]   I'll just let Scott Born do the moaning for a moment here.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.680]   Drobo.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680]   Drobo.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.520]   I'm--
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.280]   I won't moan.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.880]   I will just gleefully say my photos are safely backed up.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.440]   And at Macworld, I did a demonstration that caused people's
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.320]   eyes to bug out where I deleted an entire library of photos
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.680]   in front of them that I had stored in a vault on the Drobo
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.760]   and then pulled one of the drives out of the Drobo
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.400]   while restoring and one girl needed 911 call.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.000]   But hey, it's not--
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:05.840]   It worked.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.720]   We demonstrated it in real time.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.320]   That's impressive.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   That's also brave.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.000]   Well, I've done it 100 times.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.560]   So one lady came up to me and she goes, I was praying for you.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.880]   I was so worried that your demo wouldn't work.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.760]   And you would look foolish.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.480]   I said, lady, I've looked foolish for 54 years.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.440]   So this wouldn't have been the first time.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.600]   Anyway, it was fun.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.720]   It was fun to be able to demonstrate that kind of thing.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.640]   And I still go back to the day that Alex and I were--
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.640]   I don't know what we were doing.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.560]   Alex playing a movie, copying a movie, and something else,
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.480]   and then pulled a drive out, and it all still worked.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.040]   I think you did it in front of--
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.720]   Scott popped this drive out while they're playing a movie.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.280]   And I was like--
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.200]   Yeah, Alex nearly had a heart attack.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.560]   I had our time breathing there for a second.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.160]   How does it do that?
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.880]   It uses a-- all the drives get striped with some of the file
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.160]   allocation table style information.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.760]   So it parses all the data between the drives.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.640]   And this is, by the way, the most amateur, non-technical
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   explanation I could give you, because that's who I am.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.840]   But they have all the data stored across all the multiple
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.280]   drives.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.040]   So when you pull one out, it starts a self-healing process.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.520]   And it starts copying all that over.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.520]   But it doesn't interfere with the current processes
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.200]   while it's doing it.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.640]   Now, obviously, Drobo does not recommend that you just
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.880]   randomly walk by your Drobo and go, come here,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.400]   and pull a drive out of it.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.200]   But if something fails, which is what that is designed to
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.560]   illustrate, then it still works.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.320]   And I've got to tell you, it works really well, because I've
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.320]   done this demo 100 times.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.440]   And the Drobo people don't always like me to do this demo.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:43.720]   But I--
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.280]   Well, they're not recommending people do it.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.680]   No, they don't recommend that behavior.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.600]   And neither do I.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.960]   So it is just, I guess, in a short way.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.600]   It is the large, redundant hard drive that guards against
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.080]   data loss from a hard drive crash.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.000]   And can go as big as 16 terabytes, but that will be when
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.600]   they come up with four terabyte drives.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.000]   Right now, I guess the biggest is one.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.120]   Two's are right around the corner.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:04.960]   Two's are right around the corner.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.800]   So that would be eight.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.200]   That's amazing.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.960]   So you'd have about six gigabytes of actual storage.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.000]   Because some of its reserved for the other stuff.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.160]   So that's still--
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   It's pre-nifty.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:14.800]   Want to learn more?

[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.120]   Better not include a member FDIC.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.760]   [LAUGHTER]

[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.040]   I'm going to do this one.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.160]   I understand they are hoping to combine those all into one window, which would be really
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.160]   nice for me.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.360]   Also, for that reason, TweetDeck really takes up real estate.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.120]   It takes over your screen.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120]   It does.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.680]   I've come to grips with that by minimizing what I have up there in the panes.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.800]   I do wish that you know how you can get the widgets to pop up.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.320]   I wish there were something like that, or that maybe it had a floating HUD in the background
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.480]   that you could call up.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.760]   I would prefer that.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:36.200]   One thing the twirl does is whenever there is a new message, it pops its window open.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.240]   Does TweetDeck do that, or can you leave it minimizing?
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.880]   It will stay there.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.480]   You can have TweetDeck tweet at you, which I did for about a second and then decided that's
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.480]   annoying.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.880]   Otherwise, it just hangs out.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.680]   I just minimize it and then leave it on my dock.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.320]   Then when I want to look at it, I call it up.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.440]   It's really great to have the search field.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   I just created a search column for Mac Break.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.720]   There's all the people mentioning Mac Break in there.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.440]   There really is handy.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   I really like that.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.880]   This gives you a poor man's track, which is something that we've been lobbying for really
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.640]   hard to get track back into Twitter.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.440]   You could track topics, at least with this kind of almost real-time search, you can do
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.440]   it.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.440]   TweetDeck, it's free.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.880]   It's actually not just Mac, because it's Adobe Air.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.920]   It should run on anything Adobe Air runs on, which every ludes Windows.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.920]   Everything.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   Linux?
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.920]   I think it runs on Linux.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.920]   Is there really everything?
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.920]   Why?
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.920]   That's cool.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.920]   That's really cool.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.920]   All right.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920]   Thanks, Scott.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   Good pick.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920]   Thank you.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920]   Mr. Nutco.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   I got one thing to add, Lisa's one.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920]   Holy...
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   God, what happened there?
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   Oh my God.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.920]   He blew up.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.920]   That was flashlight happening.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.920]   The iPhone suddenly turned off.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.920]   Oh my God.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   Leo, you're using his exercise ball again.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.280]   Oh, the humanity.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   That's the last time we used hydrogen to power Mac break weekly.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280]   Very bad.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.280]   We told him it was too cold in Boston.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.280]   No smoke.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   He shattered.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.280]   He shattered.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.280]   He shattered.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   Another James Bond shootout in one.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.280]   That's all.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.280]   It says so random label for the hydrogen.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.280]   I was trying to think of...
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.800]   Lisa was recommending her elevator there.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.000]   I was trying to think of one of my favorite ones.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.160]   Unfortunately, it's in the other room.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.160]   It's not in the office.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.200]   Griffin has a really great product like that called the elevator that is not quite as
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.760]   lovely as hers.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.720]   And it doesn't hold your keyboard at a nice cool little angle, which is something that
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.960]   I really like.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.560]   But the great thing about the Griffin elevator is that you can easily break it down for
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560]   travel.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:47.640]   Instead of being one piece of folded aluminum like Lisa's, it's two really sturdy pieces
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.840]   of folded aluminum that are held together with a crossbar of thick, clear, loose sight.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.000]   So on your desk, it's rock stable.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.480]   But when you want to travel, it comes apart into three pieces, kind of like a letter
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.520]   U. And so it travels pretty much flat.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.520]   It's also cheap.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.520]   It's ten bucks less.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.360]   It looks like you use it as a martial arts weapon as well.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.160]   That's exactly not what you get on unconnected.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   You're like, "Munchuck."
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:18.560]   Yes, your Cupertino style food is good.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560]   But that's not my pick.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.720]   I pick something else entirely.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.080]   There are, I think there are, I used to think there are two really good utilities for the
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.800]   Mac that are of the, "I've got something, I've got something, a clipping, a file piece
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.720]   of data, something that I just need to keep a hold of that without actually creating a
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720]   new document."
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.200]   I needed an information organizer, so to speak.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.840]   And Evernote is the really good solution if you want one that works no matter where you
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.280]   are on any computer because it's a centralized internet service.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:54.640]   And Bear Bones, you know, Jimbo is the best if you need a really mature service for archiving,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.120]   documenting, for a wide range of features.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.680]   In the past couple of weeks, I've added a third one.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.320]   There is an app called Shovebox.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.320]   Okay.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.320]   It's an unfortunate name.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.320]   Really.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   It really is.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320]   Thanks for yourself.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320]   This is not a good name.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   From Wonder Woman.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.320]   I've got five different responses to that on the whiteboard and within my head and think
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320]   of it, you know what?
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   I can't think of one.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   Don't use one.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:24.320]   So we're just simply going to move on.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.200]   Shovebox is great because it is your solution if you want something that works more like
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:34.520]   a system enhancement rather than I'm going to do a Jimbo Land to file this thing.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:40.800]   What it is is essentially it gives it, the central fulcrum of this is a little menu icon,
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   a menu bar icon.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.600]   That is just a box with a little arrow inside it.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.560]   So if you are on the web or in a document or anywhere, you can select a piece of text
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.240]   and drag it into the drop box in the menu bar and it simply gets added to the things
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.440]   you're keeping track of.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.040]   If there's a picture off of Flickr, you drag it into the drop box and get that thing.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:02.360]   If there's a file on your desktop, drag it into the drop box, not only that, but you
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:07.960]   can access any of that through a simple recent entries menu item underneath that menu.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:15.240]   If you want something more rational organization, there is an organizer that is, let's say,
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.520]   perhaps litigiously similar to what you would find in your Jimbo.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.960]   Let's leave it at that.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.480]   But it's simple, and instruct, and effective.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:29.280]   There are also simple tools for assigning hotkeys to specific items so that if you just collected
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.640]   a piece of information on how people can get from wherever they are to your house for
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.240]   the big party and you need to send a whole bunch of different emails and you're going
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.920]   to be pacing this a whole bunch of different times, you can simply assign a hotkey to
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.120]   a hot tag to that and simply bring it up and slice it in.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:50.000]   Like I said, the stuff that you save to your drop box will only exist on that one computer
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.680]   that you've installed it on, unlike ever known.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.460]   As a matter of fact, I find that kind of refreshing.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:59.640]   It's refreshing to find a piece of software that's just a piece of desktop software.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.280]   There's nothing social about it.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.880]   There's nothing cloud about it.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.600]   It just saves stuff to your look large, right?
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.280]   It's also not quite so sophisticated as the Ojimbo is.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:15.040]   When there's a document or piece of data that is important enough that it's going to be something
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:19.120]   I'm going to need week to week, month to month, year to year, I definitely file away in Ojimbo
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.440]   or print it into YoJimbo.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.520]   Drop box is again for that hour to hour day to day sort of need where, oh God, this is
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:30.440]   exactly sort of, I'm going to need to refer to this later on or this is exactly the sort
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.080]   of link or the sort of web page that I'm going to need two days from now when I'm giving
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.080]   my talk or preparing my slides.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080]   You just drag them to the drop box.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080]   This is fantastic.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080]   It's very, very flexible.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.080]   What a find.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:45.800]   It's even flexible enough that if you drag a URL from the, from Safari or Firefox into
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   it, it has the option of either saving it as a link or can save it as a web archive.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.320]   So it can either be a link you can click on later on to get that back or it will download
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.520]   the entire page into your drop box.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.880]   And then it's just simply good for offline reading.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.880]   Oh man.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   Cool.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.880]   This is the UI I've wanted.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.360]   One of the things that you Jimbo and Evano do so well as synchronize with other, you know,
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:10.000]   through .Mac or with other, with their online database.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.040]   What kind of synchrony capabilities does it have any?
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.160]   I don't believe it has any real synchronization features.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.320]   As a matter of fact, I'm going back.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.680]   I've only been using this for the past two weeks.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.120]   I'm so impressed, Andy.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.800]   This is exactly what I've always wanted.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   I mean, this is.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.920]   Again, it'll work off your eyesight so you can hold something up to the camera.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.920]   It's, as I said, it works with spotlights.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.320]   You can do full text searches, as I said, very simple, very direct, very clean.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:38.960]   A lot of people kind of get thrown by Evano, they even get thrown by Yo Jimbo incorrectly
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.920]   thinking that's too complicated to use.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.880]   This is, this is almost like the scrapbook for Mac OS 10.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.280]   Just drag something into your menu bar and boom, you've got it.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.360]   Something very powerful here.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.640]   These rules you can add.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.960]   I'll email rules which allow you to automatically run a shell command or Apple script or so
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   forth.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:02.280]   But probably using these rules, create your own upload to .Mac or to a web dev server
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.280]   or something like that.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.680]   So in some ways, you could have that synchrony capability.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.680]   This is pretty impressive.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.560]   I mean, as a matter of fact, I created a rule.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:14.600]   I haven't used it since, but it's good to know there's a kind of power that you can
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:20.720]   just simply create a, I just take the file icon for the menu bar, my word presses and
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.920]   document, drag it into the drop box simply by the fact that I usually name my file.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.760]   You know, sometimes hyphen name of the column.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.680]   It knows that if it's been dragged in the drop box, it means it's time for me to file
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.720]   that column with my editor.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.520]   So it is, it is quite slick, quite powerful.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.840]   Because it's scriptable with these rules, I would say there's probably nothing you can't
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   do.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   There's nothing.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.920]   It's, it's, it's something that you could really get, that could really get out of hand.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.840]   Well, I'm just looking, you could say, you know, every new entry, export it, then run
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.800]   an Apple script or run a shell script command.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.520]   I mean, this, this is pretty impressive.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.720]   You know, you can export, move to folder, run a command on it.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.720]   Wow.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.800]   Jeez, Louise, I'm excited about this.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:05.560]   And I'm in a way, I'm sad because I'm so dependent on Evernote.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.520]   Are you going to abandon the Yojimbo and Evernote?
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.160]   I mean, how do you see this is my problem.
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.160]   I have all these notebooks.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:14.600]   See, that's why I didn't want to recommend it right away because it could be something
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.160]   that I kind of, I think it's really cool to, it's obviously really cool to start with.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.880]   But do you keep using it as the question?
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.080]   I find that Evernote, I like it a lot, but I'm using it less and less because it's too
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:31.280]   much, the UI isn't, it isn't difficult, but I find that I have to go into Evernote space,
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.800]   so to speak, to add stuff to it and take things out of it and work with it.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:40.360]   I've been using, I've been using shove box alongside Yojimbo and exactly the ways that
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.320]   I've been, that I've said to you.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:48.160]   If it's, I tend to think that if it's information that I need in an hour, in a day and a week,
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.720]   it goes into the shove box.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.960]   If it's something that I need to, basically, I need to have this place where everything
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.480]   gets archived, interesting pieces of information or receipts or tax stuff that I absolutely
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.640]   need to track, it goes into Yojimbo.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:05.480]   For all the reasons, for all the reasons of its ability to sync with other services,
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:11.280]   to archive, to save to places, I don't think that shove box is designed for that sort of
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   thing.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.480]   I don't think that it's part of its idiom.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   It's designed to be simple, direct, very tactile.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.560]   - Yojimbo, I'm happy to be with you.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.120]   - Yojimbo does have a menu bar capability.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.600]   You can paste Evernote, clip the screenshot.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.400]   You can do some of that functionality.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.280]   The reason I use Evernote is because of the iPhone app.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.560]   That's what really is the killer thing in Evernote.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.200]   Boy, now I got a tough decision because I don't want to have 18 different notebook
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200]   applications.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.040]   It's been bad enough moving from Yojimbo to Evernote.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.560]   - And I moved from War-A to Yojimbo.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.920]   - It helps for me that all the reasons why I would be using Evernote, those things are
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.600]   being taken care of via either the things application on iPhone or on Instapaper.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.040]   So it'll fit into your style, if that's your style.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.200]   - So there's a reason, sorry.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   - Go, go, go, go, go.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   You're good, go.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.600]   - So it's the reason there are no good games for the Mac platform because Mac people have
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.560]   more fun with productivity.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.720]   - These are organizing our games.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.720]   These are our games.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.160]   - We like our bright lights and shining objects.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.720]   - How about a magazine?
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.600]   - I brought into the menu, Bonnet.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.600]   - It's a painting.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.600]   - Oh, wait, that's a painting.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.600]   - Do a thing.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.600]   - Look at that.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.680]   How'd that penguin get on the menu bar?
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:32.080]   - So that poem was due three days ago and then I drag a URL like Andy.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.880]   I go to present two hours.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.880]   - Stop it.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.160]   - But how many notebook apps are there?
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.480]   I mean, there's circus ponies.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   There's no taker.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   There's, I mean, no pad.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.840]   It goes on and on and on voodoo pad.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.640]   And what bugs me, I love voodoo pad for the wiki.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.840]   I mean, they all have features I want.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.040]   But when someone uses it to come with a lot of money, just buy them all.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.040]   - Mergium.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.040]   - Mergium all.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.440]   - You can eat an automatic application launcher for notebook apps.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440]   (laughter)
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.680]   - Look at it, analyze the information figures.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.320]   You know what, this seems like more of a yojimbo thing or no, I think you'll need this
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.320]   in every note.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.240]   - Where should I put this today?
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.040]   - You know, I think Souths are going and could probably write you an automated script that
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.560]   would do all that.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560]   (laughter)
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.760]   - Let's see, I'm gonna give Fred, we're gonna put you last.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   - I'm ready.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760]   - Oh, you feel good?
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760]   You feel good?
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760]   - I got a line up.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.240]   - But I have another notebook.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.240]   - Oh no.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.240]   (laughter)
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   - See, I think it is, we're going down this notebook.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.200]   - Okay, where you go with this?
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.880]   - So I have a paper notebook.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.360]   - Adam's not Adam's.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.360]   - The Monoskeen name.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.040]   - It looks like a monoskeen name.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.240]   - It looks like a monoskeen name.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.760]   - This is a live scribe, so you'll notice that this--
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.880]   - You brought this, I thought you were gonna talk about it.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.040]   - I am, here it is.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.800]   - Is this the notebook that goes with--
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   - Is this your pick?
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   - This is my pick.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.800]   - Okay.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800]   - This is how many Alex's?
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:49.800]   - This is about a third of an Alex.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.800]   - Oh, that's not bad.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.200]   - It's about $199 for the two gig in 149 for the one gig version.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.680]   - They had this at Macworld, I saw it.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.480]   - And I went to Macworld and I spent--
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480]   - I used the Windows one.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.000]   - I have to say I spent more money at Macworld than I've ever spent.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.560]   - I got halfway through the presentation, 'cause I figured I was gonna go over and see
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560]   if I could get a loan or--
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.400]   - You know, you don't have to test it.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:12.520]   He got a third through his little presentation of how the LiveScribe worked, and I was like,
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.760]   "Okay, you don't need to waste my time, you don't need to waste your time."
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.840]   I just want to put my credit card.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.600]   - So it's a big-ass pen.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.440]   - It's a big-ass pen for $150.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.800]   - So, no, what it does is this pen has a little camera underneath the pen.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:36.920]   It looks at the data that is sitting-- it looks at this micro pattern that's on this pad.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.560]   And as I write on it, as I write on the pad, I've showed a couple notes here, I've just
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.000]   started to write, it's going to record all of these notes.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.160]   There's a lot of times when I'm stuck somewhere where I don't want to open my computer, but
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.440]   I want to start thinking stuff out and writing outlines, but I don't write on paper because
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.440]   I lose paper.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.440]   - Right.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.520]   - And so I just need something to capture that, but what I always think of is then I should
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:01.080]   just scan that journal into my Mac because I'm going to lose in the journal, I'm never
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.280]   going to come back to it, I'm never going to refer to it again.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.960]   So the ability to be able to just write stuff down and then be able to literally just drop
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   plug it into this little USB-- it's got a little magnet in it, and I can plug it in,
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:21.440]   and it immediately will pop up on the LiveScribe desktop, which will let me export PDFs of everything
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.520]   that I was writing on the pad.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.480]   Now, the thing that makes it even cooler is that it has a microphone in it.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:33.640]   So what it'll do is there's a little button at the bottom that has literally-- it's really
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   weird.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.840]   There's a button that looks like a record button on the pad that I'm using.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:42.520]   When I click on it, it makes a little-- let's see if I click on it right now, I'll probably
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.720]   make a little-- just tap the pen on it.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.240]   - Yeah, so you tap the pen on it, and the pen says, "Oh, I'm recording," and if I hit
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.840]   stop, it'll make another little noise.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.560]   It says, "I've stopped."
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.840]   During that time, anything that I write, it's indexing the audio to what I'm writing.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:02.640]   So if I go back, and I can literally go back to what was happening when I was-- so if I
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:10.560]   go back, for instance, and click on-- I record this a little earlier.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.400]   So it'll actually play back whatever the audio was when I was writing those notes.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.320]   So if you're taking notes, especially for me, what it is if I'm meeting with clients.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.120]   So I'm meeting with a production client, and we want to talk about stuff, and I'm writing
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:26.680]   notes, and of course, legally, I need to tell them that this is what the--
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.680]   - They record it.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.680]   - That I'm recording.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.520]   But I can literally sit there and take notes.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.840]   And what I'm really doing is I can try to take as many notes as I want, but if I can't
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.360]   remember exactly what they said they wanted, or if I'm in the school and I want to remember
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.000]   exactly what the teacher said, or whatever it is, I simply just click on those words
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.560]   again, and it'll play it back.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.640]   It'll do the same thing in the Mac.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:52.440]   So if I click on the piece that I imported when I'm in the desktop, it'll play back that
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.440]   audio as well.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.440]   - That'd be ideal for students.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.440]   - Oh man.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.440]   - Yeah.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.440]   - Ticking those lectures and that sort of thing.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.280]   - It's got the same demo, Alex, and I was very impressed.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.200]   And the audio connection to it is what's really strong for me.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.200]   - Right.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.320]   And the thing that the live scribe-- one thing I will say is that I got the presentation
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.040]   and then I dropped the money really, really fast and was like, whatever I need to do.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.240]   The other thing is these pads, you worry about having to order them from the company, they
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.240]   sell them at Target.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.640]   - Yeah, I think you can print your own.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.120]   I think on a PC, on the Mac they're still working on it.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   - Oh, they don't have that.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   - So now the--
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.400]   - So they're cheap at Target?
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.600]   - It's like 12 bucks for one of these.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.600]   Same as a moleskin.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.600]   - Okay.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:37.800]   - And so the other thing about this is that I was really worried that it was going to
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.760]   come and it was going to be complicated, it was going to take me a while to learn it.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.400]   I will say the other thing that really-- that everything here just feels like someone thought
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   it out.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.920]   You know, the way the thing works, there's great training that comes with it that shows
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920]   you how to use the whole pen.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.920]   I mean, within 10 minutes of bringing the pen out, I knew exactly how to use almost all
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:57.920]   the features.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.880]   I knew how to-- you know, and it walks you through it very, very carefully.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.480]   So it's not just that it is-- it's not just that it's a cool item.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:10.240]   There's a lot of cool items, but they really supported it with good support materials, good
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.040]   training so that I can immediately get it hooked up.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:18.800]   The one thing that I would love to see is for them to time-- they export AAC for the audio
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.400]   and what they don't do yet is put the frames of what you wrote, you know, don't have it
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   going with it.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.880]   I asked about that and they said they're working on it.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.240]   - How much audio can it record?
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240]   Like how long?
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.240]   - Like 20 hours or so.
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.200]   - I mean, it's-- you can buy different pens with different amount of memory.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.680]   So I got the one with two gigs.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680]   Two gigs.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680]   - That's quite a bit of memory.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   - It's a long, long.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.680]   - Wow.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.080]   - 'Cause there are AACs, you said, so they're fairly-- probably like 64.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.080]   - Yeah.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.080]   - You know, whatever.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.080]   - Two gigs, yeah.
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.920]   - Well, that would have happened a lot.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.480]   - I've had one for a couple months now and it really-- it works really well.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.880]   It's very, very practical.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:54.220]   It's great to be in the middle of a briefing and have to be able to write and then the
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:57.920]   CEO just blather it on about something he's never gonna actually ship and then later on
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.640]   I can simply tap on that and just get all the audio that he blathers about.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:02.640]   - As he blathers.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:03.640]   - Yeah.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.640]   - That's good for me 'cause I'm not a good note taker.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:05.640]   - I'm horrible.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:09.160]   - But all you have to do is take the bullet point and then you've got the full audio there.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.240]   That's pretty cool.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.240]   - That's awesome.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.440]   - So, rock obama was inaugurated, gave speech.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:15.440]   - And then--
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.440]   - You just put that in the speech.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:17.440]   - Yeah, just get clicked on the speech.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.440]   That's pretty cool.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.440]   - Yeah, that is really cool.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.400]   - And then with the headphone set that comes with it has like surround sound.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:26.040]   So like if you record everything in stereo and yeah, if you put the-- there's a little
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.040]   headphone--
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.280]   - You could tell where people are and it'll literally give you that kind of stereo back
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   and forth.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.480]   So if you're in a meeting, it'll tell you this person-- oh, that guy.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.480]   - Oh, that guy.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480]   - That person on that side.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   - Oh, that's cool.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   - That's cool.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:38.680]   - I mean, they thought this one all the way out.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   I mean, that's the thing that--
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.600]   - And I have to, 'cause this, I'll tell you, there's a huge barrier to entry on something
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.800]   like this besides the cost.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.040]   There's a learning curve.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.040]   It's, you know, I mean, it's geeks like you are gonna love it and maybe like our audience.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.520]   But to get that thing in the mainstream--
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.800]   - Well, it said for me, you know, I think, you know, just for me, I just-- I stopped writing
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.840]   on paper actually after my wife thought she was helping me and she grabbed my jeans
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:03.960]   and just threw them in the washer and that was like the notes for the next version of
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.600]   the Pixel Core, you know, you know, you know, it's-- it's just like-- it was like hours
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.520]   of me writing on, you know, at a Starbucks and I was like, okay, I'm never writing anything
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520]   on paper again.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520]   - And that was it.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.520]   - And I was like a year and a half ago.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.520]   - Yeah.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.960]   - And this allows me to have what I like, which is that organic and, you know, I doubt
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.880]   that anyone on the plane will know that it's electronics so I can use it on the tendency
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   of the way.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   - That's probably true.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.880]   - They don't know.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.880]   - So I can sit there and be taking notes on my pad.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.880]   - The plane goes down, it's 'cause of you and your--
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880]   - Like scribe.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880]   (laughing)
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.040]   - Now we know who to blame.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.520]   They said it was Canadian geese, but--
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.520]   - No, exactly.
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.880]   - It's a man with his and it like scribe on the plane.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.960]   - We got the black boxer quarterback and it was something we had pin action going on
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:39.960]   in it.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.480]   - Yeah, that's a nice-- I'd lose that though.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.800]   I swear I would just like, where's my pin?
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.800]   My world in there.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   - That's a good point because I've lost every pin I've ever owned.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.800]   - Yeah, same here.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.800]   - That's what every guy's gonna do is download everything.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.800]   So you're downloading everything.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.440]   So you pull it off as long as you plug it into the computer.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.160]   - That's what I need a pin I have to dock.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.160]   - That had solved that.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.160]   - Yeah.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.160]   - USB-perm.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.160]   - And recharge.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.600]   - So let's see, what's analog that we can add some technology to.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.600]   - Pins!
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   - It really mess up.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600]   - What works really well, pen and paper.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.600]   - We've got the sunglasses.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.160]   - We've got pins.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.840]   We haven't gotten the pins yet.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.840]   - Frederick V. Johnson.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.600]   Do you like Frederick Van or Frederick Johnson?
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.840]   - Well, Frederick, you can call me Frederick.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.840]   - Frederick, you can call me Frederick.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.240]   - I've got, so when I put up Fred Johnson on there, that's completely the wrong thing
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.240]   to put up there.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.240]   - Oh, I answered it there too.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.240]   - Okay.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240]   - I answered it.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.040]   - You know, I know your website, you say, you copyright Frederick Van.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.040]   - Right.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.040]   - Yep.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.040]   - So is that your--
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.040]   - If Daddy just don't own a moving company.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.040]   - I'm gonna go there, scubble.
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.040]   - I can't help it.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.320]   - My full give-it name is Frederick Van Johnson.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.120]   So I wrote a book for Peach Pit, and on the cover is Fred Johnson.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.640]   I haven't lived that down yet, especially from my family.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.200]   - 'Cause you really want to be that.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.120]   - Yeah, I'm older now.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.840]   I want to be more distinguished and more expensive, isn't it?
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.840]   - Is it?
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.840]   (laughter)
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.840]   - You know?
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:56.840]   - So, the expense--
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.640]   - Frederick, more syllables equals more--
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:02.280]   - And is Van the middle name or is it Van Johnson like--
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.600]   - Van is my middle name.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:07.280]   - You know, all the guys, all the males in my family have the same middle name and it's
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.280]   Van.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.280]   - Oh, that's cool.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   - So it's tight--
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.280]   - It's fixed it, like that.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   - Bonzus, yes.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   Doesn't that look more expensive than Fred Johnson?
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.560]   - No, I can make it more expensive.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.360]   You want it to be even more expensive?
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360]   - You're the ornate font, or is that right?
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360]   - Yeah, I'm just saying the fourth.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.360]   (laughter)
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.360]   - And then it really--
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.360]   - There you go.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.360]   - Very bad Johnson, the fourth is--
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.360]   - So now I'm gonna sit down and--
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.120]   - Make up the way your teeth clinched when you say my name.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.120]   - Yeah.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120]   (laughter)
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.120]   - That's because it's FVJ.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.120]   We call them VJ.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.120]   - Exactly.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.800]   Even that accent sounds more expensive.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.800]   - Yeah, it's VJ.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.800]   (laughter)
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.800]   - What's your pick, VJ?
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.400]   - Well, my pick, I have three picks.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.920]   But they're very quick, very quick.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.920]   - That's fine.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.520]   - So, it's been the longest pick segment we've ever done.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.440]   I'm gonna blow through these picks, but you know, these are like from what I'm doing in
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.680]   my world right now.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.080]   - So, that's good.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.640]   - The first one is I'm trying to get organized.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.080]   It's the beginning of the year, I have a lot of stuff to do, so I'm using-- and you guys
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.280]   probably talked about this already.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.520]   I'm sure Merlin has, but this application called Things.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.480]   It's a getting things done application.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.640]   So, list management app that also has an iPhone version that brings all your tasks.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:12.640]   It tasks in there.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:13.640]   You can check them off.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.640]   And it's really simple.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:20.400]   The UI is done really, really intuitively, really well, really Apple-like.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.240]   And it's, you know, I've tried the Omni applications and a bunch of online versions of sort of
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.800]   list management.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800]   This one has stuck.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:28.800]   So, I'm using it.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.800]   - Omni is too complicated.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:30.800]   - It has so many features.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   - I couldn't handle it.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800]   - Yeah, a lot of features.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.680]   - You're getting the Xdonda to really get the most out.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.880]   - Even if you understand GTD, it was not--
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.320]   - Well, you don't have to understand it with this one.
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.480]   It's just like, you know, it's a bunch of stuff that you have to do, and it's contextual.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.160]   So, when I'm at home, I do this stuff.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.680]   When I'm over here, I do this stuff, you know.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:49.680]   So, you know.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.680]   So, that's my first one.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.680]   - So, I played with that one that was in beta, and I really liked it.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.680]   - Things.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.200]   - And I wasn't sure, yeah, I wasn't sure whether to buy, because it's 50 bucks.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.200]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.920]   - You know, a couple negatives to it, or one main negative to the application, it syncs
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.280]   through Wi-Fi if it's on the same network as your phone.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280]   - Okay.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.280]   - Which is great.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.800]   You launch them both, and it's just seamless, boom, all your tasks are synced up.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.720]   But it doesn't sync to the cloud.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.360]   And I need that cloud syncing.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.280]   You know, exactly, I made that same face.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   You know, I need to--
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280]   (laughter)
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.840]   I need to, if I'm checking things off, you know, I--
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.320]   - And I'm at a Starbucks.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320]   I need it to--
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320]   - My phone sync face.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320]   - Yeah.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   - Actually, that's my phone.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320]   - Or a web interface.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   It'd be great if I had a web interface.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.400]   But if I'm not near my phone or this, I can still see what I needed it.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400]   - Well, that's on with you on that.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.000]   I think more and more applications not in the cloud, especially if it's an application
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   that's gonna go on your phone.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   It ought to be.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   - Yep.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000]   - Yeah.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   - So that's number one.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.480]   Number two is a piece of hardware that I just got my hands on that I'm hoping I'll get
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.800]   some time this weekend to incorporate into my living room.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.800]   It's a sling box.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:46.800]   - Ooh.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.240]   - It's a sling box HD.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:49.240]   - Ooh.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.040]   - That I am installing.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.240]   - I have a sling to the phone, right?
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.280]   - First quarter, or actually, when I guess a couple months or a couple weeks or so.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.840]   They're gonna get the iPhone version of this sling player out.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.560]   So hopefully I'll get that.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.640]   And once I get this thing grafted in, anything I'm watching on my TV will be available through
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.240]   a browser and on my phone.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240]   - Yep.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:14.080]   - As if I need some other distraction and another piece of kit in my living room.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.720]   - Now, how does the, how well does the HD stream?
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.000]   I mean, isn't that pretty heavy duty video?
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]   - Well, you know, I haven't set it up yet.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   So I don't know.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.080]   So hopefully I'll let you know.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.080]   - So this thing is a box that has a little number.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.080]   - It does.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.520]   Yeah, on the local network, it would make sense.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.000]   But how, why would you need it on the local network, Andy?
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.400]   - I'm using copper as my, as my backbone through for everything throughout the entire
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:37.400]   house.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   - Oh, I guess that makes sense.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.960]   So you can watch your cable in your bedroom even though you don't have a cable drop.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.320]   - Can you change the channel in the bedroom?
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.560]   When the cable somewhere else?
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.560]   - Exactly.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.560]   You get, you get not, it actually, when you, when you tell it what kind of a cable box
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:52.360]   you have, it actually will give you an on-screen picture of your actual remote.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   So if you want to actually just push the DVR button, it'll push the DVR button.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.520]   And there, there, there are money, there are a lot more slick and sophisticated ways of
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.760]   getting around the remote.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.600]   But it's just, just the fact that realize that, well, yes, we'll give them shortcuts.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.280]   Yes, they'll give them on screen, on screen programming, but okay, we'll just throw a
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.960]   picture of the remote up there so they'll just be able to click on what they want.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:15.000]   But HD does work outside of the local network too.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.680]   It's just that out, when you're on copper, you will get full HD.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.440]   It will be pretty much as good as if you were actually in the room with it.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:29.200]   If you are on a, I find that if I'm in someone else's, let's say someone else's corporate
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.560]   internet, it'll work just fine.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:36.080]   If I'm in a crappy hotel Wi-Fi internet, it might have to drop down.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.640]   But the great thing about the sling box is that it's smart enough to realize how fast
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.400]   it's communicating with you.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.400]   And we'll, and I have to-
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.600]   - So it degrades gracefully.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.600]   It doesn't-
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:45.600]   - Exactly.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.600]   I mean, I have, when I'm on Amtrak, it takes like three, four hours.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.400]   - Yeah, it's from Boston to New York City.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:55.640]   I have been sling boxing watching everything off of TV the night before, just simply off
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:57.960]   of like a sprint, like EVDO modem.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.960]   - That's awesome.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.200]   - And it drops, it's perfectly watchful.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.840]   It drops down to basically what you would get at, you know, like almost like YouTube
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.840]   resolution.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:10.040]   But the fact is it's flicker free, it's absolutely in sync.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.960]   And the fact that it doesn't, unlike over the air HD broadcast, it doesn't say, "No,
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.000]   this is not nearly good enough quality for me to show it to you."
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.720]   I wouldn't insult you by actually showing you the more relevant show at this resolution.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720]   No, no.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.920]   - Turning to the Kelsey Grammar Show.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.680]   - More, Tovitch.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.600]   - Off the air for how many years?
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.600]   Not enough.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:39.200]   But yeah, I'm always thrilled that like, you know, my H, over the air broadcast HD,
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:44.880]   you know, today I was, I get two channels, exactly two channels over that come in and
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.680]   digital broadcast over the air.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:51.440]   So essentially if, if CBS was not coming in this morning, then instead of watching the
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:54.960]   inaugural, I would have had to watch the Tyra Bank Show because that was the only other
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:59.000]   thing that I could have gotten in HD over the air.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.360]   This is not a good world that we're, that we're going to be in at the end of February.
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.360]   I'm just saying.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.360]   - No.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.360]   Well, that's good.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.840]   So there are confirmation, Alfred, of the sleep start approach.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:10.840]   - I'm sorry, bro, H.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.080]   - So I'll be in, I'll be in Andy Nirvana, hopefully by this time.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.080]   - We call it Nerdvana.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.080]   (laughter)
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.080]   - That comes together.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:23.040]   - They'll, they'll say, I talked about another box they have called the Slink Catcher, which
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.720]   is it once, it's like, it's like setting up habit trails in your home where you buy like
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.600]   the starter kit, but then it gets so cool that you keep adding stuff on and adding stuff
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.600]   on.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.160]   - It's more like your animals than habit trails.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.280]   So they, they, they're other boxes that do also really, and so intensely cool thing with
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.720]   the, with the Slink Catcher, I can just simply throw a Slink Catcher in my luggage.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.240]   This little box about, I don't know, about it's maybe about six inches by about four
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.400]   inches.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.800]   And so I didn't think to bring it with me, but I could have simply brought it with me
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   to San Francisco.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:53.800]   (laughter)
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.800]   - I'm sorry.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.800]   - I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.440]   - I thought I was being, I thought I was like the Oscar, that I was being played off.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.440]   (laughter)
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.640]   - But I haven't thanked Jesus yet.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.280]   - I'm not saying, I'm not saying you were, but I'm not saying you weren't.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.280]   - Okay, okay.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.280]   (laughter)
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.280]   - There are no accidents.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280]   - Only passive.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.280]   - That's a aggressive move.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.280]   (laughter)
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.840]   - It is four o'clock, isn't it?
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:18.480]   - It's getting late.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.680]   And I'm, I have the last product that Andy's had for months that I am new to.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.760]   And I bet you have had this for months.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.560]   The MSI Wind, have you had this for months?
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.520]   - I have not had this for months.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.360]   They're, they're sending me one, believe it or not.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.560]   You got a conference, I got, I got a confirmation email to us today, yes.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:36.920]   - I got it before Andy got to it.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.920]   Ha ha.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.280]   - No, I just, the reason I bought this, and this is a pretty amazing, these are the
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.440]   little new netbooks.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.960]   And there are two of them, the Del Mini and the MSI Wind that you can put OS X on.
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.080]   I haven't done a lag this much, so sorry Apple.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.280]   And in fact, Tony, who's going to be editing this show any minute now, is in the other
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.160]   room with the Del Mini running OS X.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.440]   Beautifully, and that's where I got the inspiration for this.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.120]   I saw not only Tony's, but a number of people at Mac World Expo, including Derek's story
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:11.240]   had, I was blown away, OS X running on these little, you know, two pound netbooks.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.480]   Now this is the, this is kind of the higher end, uh, MSI Wind.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.080]   It has 160 gig hard drive, not solid state.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.640]   It has a six cell battery, so it's a little bit heavier.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.280]   Um, so it's also a little bit more expensive.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.920]   It's 429, but an LED screen, glossy screen, beautiful screen.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:31.800]   Um, it is, you know, not full, uh, uh, resolution, but it is 800 lines top to bottom.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.920]   I think like W.S.V.G.A.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.920]   I don't know what that is.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.920]   - People are walking around with Apple logos on them.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920]   Did you see that Leo?
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.560]   - Well, I was thinking I could just take the Apple sticker that comes to your Apple stuff
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.360]   and put it right over the MSI.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.360]   - And that's what they're doing.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.360]   - Yeah.
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.560]   This will look like a, a, uh, it'll be very confusing to everybody.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.880]   - Or just a giant picture of your face.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.880]   I don't know.
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:50.880]   - That would be confusing to me.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.440]   So, yeah, the Leo book.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.320]   Uh, maybe that's a good idea, Lisa.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:57.240]   I think I'll do that.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.840]   - You can be just like Apple only.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.720]   You'll be cheaper because you're only, you're only charging a 90% markup.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.720]   - It's got a 100%--
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:06.600]   - It's got Wi-Fi and in it, it's got Bluetooth in it.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.480]   It's got a webcam in it.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.480]   - Oh.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.040]   - I think for 4.29 it's pretty amazing.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.240]   The keyboard is almost full size.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.160]   It's a very nice keyboard.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.960]   So I'll be later this afternoon.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.160]   I'll be, uh, don't tell Apple this, but I'll be figuring out if I can put OS X on it.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.920]   But you know what I am gonna do is it's got, the reason I got the one with the biggest
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.560]   hard drive, the 160 card drive is I can, I can triple boot this.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:32.240]   So I'm gonna put OS X, I can use, can't put OS X, put Windows 7 on it and have Linux on
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.240]   it.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:37.200]   And then I, then that is kind of an amazing thing for something, this little and fun.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.200]   That's a toy.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.080]   - I'm 39 bucks the MSI wind, but they range from three--
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.640]   - How big is it, Leo?
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.520]   - It is, I don't know, it's, it's purse sized.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.520]   It's, um--
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.520]   - Perse size.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.360]   - I carry a purse, don't you?
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.360]   - A MERS.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.360]   - A MERS?
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.360]   It's a man purse.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.560]   - It'll fit in the back pocket of your big trucker pants.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.760]   - Or your internet pants?
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.960]   - Actually, I have the Asus version of this--
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.560]   - Right, and it does fit in the back seat of my internet pants.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.560]   - Oh yeah.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.040]   - Of course it's fun with Jack Bauer being able to fit it in his, his bag.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.040]   - Oh yeah, easy.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.520]   - Yeah, out of the end, have enough time!
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:22.480]   - I had the, I had the, the original Asus EPC I bought because I was so excited by the
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.680]   idea, but it was really too small, 7 inch.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.480]   This is a 10 inch screen.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.960]   Yeah, I'm pretty impressed with this.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.960]   So, so far so good, it's running Windows.
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.880]   Well, I put an extra gig of, you know how much, so it comes with a gig.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:33.880]   So I had to put another gig in.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.000]   You know how much an extra gig of RAM costs now?
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000]   - $17.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.880]   - But does that mean the $1,200 I paid for the extra 8 gigs of RAM on my new 17 inch Mac
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.840]   Pro was a little high-fryer price?
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.480]   - Maybe just a little.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.200]   - Oh, this is, this is only DDR2.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.200]   You have DDR3.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.200]   - Okay.
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.200]   - I feel a little bit better.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.400]   - It's one better.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:57.880]   I'm, anyway, I'll let you know next week how the Hackintosh process works.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:59.720]   I will not post a video online.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.720]   - Apple seems to take it pretty personally.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.720]   - They don't like it.
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.200]   - Why, it was, why are they did that?
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.200]   - Why did it, and Apple said--
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.200]   - They didn't sue them.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.400]   - No, they just said, no, they just, I think they would have.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.920]   I think the first step was, yeah, you need to take that down.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.360]   Is it, could they sue me for talking about it?
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.360]   - I don't--
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.360]   - We'll find out what we--
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.360]   - It's free country.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:22.280]   - Yeah, I mean, it's my opinion that this is a journalistic enterprise to see how that,
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.520]   you know, people are talking about doing this.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.520]   I'd like to see how hard it is to do.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.760]   I'm not saying I'm gonna leave it on there.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.680]   I'm just saying I want to see, I want to explore.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.880]   And truth is, sue me for this Apple.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.240]   I'm probably gonna run a Windows 7 on it.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.760]   I think that's actually the operating system of choice for this thing.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.760]   - Right.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:40.360]   - But there you go, the MSI wins.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:45.000]   So a lot of picks for you kids, go run out, get the Daddy's Charge card, and run out,
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.160]   and buy everything you've just heard on the show, including most importantly.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.400]   - We should be giving people a grand total at the end of every show.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   You know, this was--
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.400]   - I don't know how this was--
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.960]   - Yeah, this was one way or five.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.800]   - It was not a cheap show.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.800]   But don't forget--
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.600]   - What we should do is we should have a contest like The Price is Right, where we don't
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:04.160]   tell the prices of anything, and people watching live on Twitter have to like bid,
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.160]   and whoever comes the closest to the grand total without going over.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.160]   - Maybe they have to--
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.160]   - I think we recommend.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.520]   - Or they have to sell Ado what it's going to be before we even start talking about it.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.520]   - You know, it's gonna be--
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:15.520]   - Yeah.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.160]   Somebody suggested that I kind of, on the logo, put a Leo face with a chunk bitten out of
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.760]   my head, so it would kind of look like a Macintosh logo.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:26.760]   - A little bottom on it.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:27.760]   - Yeah.
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.520]   - Leo, with a chunk out of the Leo.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.680]   - Which lobe, left or right?
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.680]   I can't decide.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.680]   - Which--
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.680]   - Which--
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:35.680]   - My verbal or my math functions.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.280]   - That was your thought, that was her something.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.160]   - All right, kids, we're all done here.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:44.080]   Thank you for listening, and thank you all for being here.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.200]   Frederick V. Johnson IV is on Twitter.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.200]   He's on the Twitter as--
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:53.040]   - As Frederick Van, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K-V-A-N.
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.400]   - And Frederick Vanen.com is the website.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.240]   - Brand new, shiny website.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.240]   - Yep.
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.800]   - So follow him on Twitter and get the to the new website.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.800]   - Lisa Bettany is mostly Lisa.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:04.800]   - Mostly.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.320]   - On Twitter, mostlyleesa.com as well.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.400]   It's so nice to have you.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.440]   I hope you'll make this trip down the coast more often.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.840]   - I loved it, it was great to be there.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.360]   - Skype makes it all possible.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.040]   Mostly Lisa on Twitter.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:22.880]   Scott Borne, who now has followed and become a Twitter
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.840]   file from a phobe to a phile.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.800]   - I'm 30 and 35 away from 7,000 followers.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.800]   - That's pretty good, that's great.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.720]   - It would have been six. - It would have six.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.760]   - S-C-O-T-T-B-O-U-R-N-E.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.760]   Can we get him to 7,000 before we end this show?
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:38.120]   I think we can.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.600]   He's also at tripphoto.com.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.520]   And don't forget the new website.
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:41.720]   Really cool idea, Scott.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.160]   I'm so glad you're doing it, Scott.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.160]   And I'm so glad it's them, not me, you're critiquing.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.080]   Scott critiques.com.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:48.920]   But no, you know what?
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:51.760]   We need a site where you don't need to be gentle,
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.160]   where you could just say, "Look, I'm gonna tell you the truth."
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.400]   As I see it.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.720]   - I really think you should send in a photo.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.280]   That would be a monumental day,
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:01.000]   and the traffic would be really good.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.200]   - I don't know if I'm ready for you, you get, Scott.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.120]   - Send in one of your Tasmanian photos.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:07.960]   - Okay.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.440]   - Those were good, I saw them.
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.920]   They could survive the Scott critique.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.960]   - Do you think they could survive?
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.800]   - Yes, they would.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:14.640]   - If you say that, Fred,
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:15.640]   you're a really good photographer.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.120]   If you say that, maybe I'll take a chance.
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:18.960]   - I've seen this.
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.480]   - I'm sitting with some really good photographers,
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.000]   I gotta say.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.200]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core,
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.920]   P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.com,
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:30.840]   and he's also part of the TripPhoto podcast.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.200]   That's actually all of you are.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.320]   (all laughing)
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.560]   - Wait a minute, there's a team here.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.400]   - I'm the only one who's--
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.920]   - I've been on once with Fred, you were on.
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.080]   I've been on once, and I'm never gonna be on again,
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:42.960]   'cause otherwise it will just be "Twip Photo."
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.040]   - Yeah.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.080]   - This show will become "Twip Photo."
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.120]   - I don't know, but I've never been on "Twick."
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.560]   - You've never been on "Andy"?
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.360]   - Clearly you've seen my flicker feed.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.440]   - I've never been on "Twick" right.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.280]   - That's a cry for help.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.320]   - Well, I think we need to bring Andy on.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.720]   - I think we should.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.240]   - Andy, we'll be on the show.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.080]   - Excellent.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.360]   - So, TWIP Photo.com actually,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.880]   Scott's kind of maintaining that site.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.560]   - You want to listen to the podcast,
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.400]   it's pixelcore.tv.
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.400]   - Yes.
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.400]   - Orin iTunes.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.240]   - Orin iTunes.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:10.400]   - And I'm just on Twitter as well.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.240]   - Alex Lindsey.
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:12.080]   - Alex Lindsey.
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:12.920]   - With an A.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.080]   - A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:16.920]   Like the least.
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.480]   - Are you still doing "Blog Alex"?
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.920]   - I do the blog when I travel,
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.080]   so you'll see like little bits of it,
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.520]   but it starts and stops. - Alex Lindsey Project.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:27.080]   - Yeah, it's just the Vox.AlexL Lindsey.com.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.440]   I'm working on something else.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.720]   - You're gonna move on Fox though, aren't you?
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.800]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm just working on something.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.640]   I haven't got it out.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:33.080]   I decided I wasn't gonna launch a blog
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:35.600]   until I had enough content stacked up,
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.960]   you know, that I didn't have to worry about it every day
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.240]   'cause my schedule's a little nutty.
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.640]   - I'm gonna just enjoy reading your blog
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.480]   when you're on the road
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:44.880]   and deciding, you know, what piece of gear
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.760]   you're gonna leave behind in the various countries.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:47.600]   - Exactly.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.280]   (laughs)
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.840]   I haven't done that for a little while.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:51.680]   - Okay.
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.000]   - What piece of gear has Alex left behind?
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.080]   It'd be a fun game.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:57.920]   Andy Inako is the guy at the Chicago Sun Times
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.200]   who writes about tech.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.400]   He also has his great website,
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.200]   the Celestial Waste of Banwith.com.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.880]   What's your Twitter?
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:07.440]   I mean, your Flickr handle?
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:10.080]   - Just simply Andy I, A-N-D-Y-I.
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:13.440]   I wisely, oddly enough, when I was signing for Flickr,
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:15.600]   realized that no one can possibly spell Anatko.
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.000]   So, (laughs)
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.000]   so I'm Andy I on flickerflicker.com/photos/andii.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.680]   I am Anatko on Twitter, but good luck spelling it.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.760]   - I, well, you know what?
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:28.520]   I have no idea how to spell it.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:31.360]   I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.200]   - Okay.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.840]   - And I, you are one of my Flickr contacts
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.760]   because I just always love seeing Andy's pictures.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.080]   He's one of my favorite photographers.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.760]   - I happily describe myself as an enthusiastic amateur.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.640]   I still have much to learn,
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.520]   but I'm proud of the pictures that I take.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.160]   - What do you mean these are great?
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160]   - Isn't he good? - He's getting at them.
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.880]   - I know, he deserves more credit.
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:52.720]   - He really does.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.720]   - That's a great portrait of Sal Segoin, by the way.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.520]   Yeah, he, I just love it.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.120]   - And you do seem to take a lot of food pictures.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.320]   Is that's with the thumb tripod?
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.680]   (laughs)
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:03.600]   - Well, I'll just, I'll just say that the best,
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.760]   I take a lot of food pictures
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.240]   'cause I get a lot of response to it.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:11.240]   I, the only significant praise I've ever received
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.520]   for anything that I've done creatively,
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.040]   this is the mark that I try to beat
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.000]   every time I write or do anything.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.120]   A picture of a really greatly shot stack of pancakes
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:22.240]   with a butter melting down and all this sort of stuff.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.240]   It just simply was the, simply was the sentence, Andy.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.160]   I am now officially aroused.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:29.240]   (laughs)
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.720]   That's it.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.560]   Okay.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.840]   (laughs)
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:35.960]   - I'll have to look for that.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:36.800]   That's really good.
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:37.680]   You do great portraits too.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:40.560]   I think a lot of the, the portrait set is really just fantastic.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:41.920]   - Yeah. - So awesome.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.760]   - Thanks.
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:47.760]   - I'm @nei on Flickr and on Twitter, I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:50.880]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:51.800]   I don't think I'm on Twitter,
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.480]   but someday I'll get a Twitter account.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.880]   We do thank you for listening to the show.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.200]   And we also encourage you, by the way,
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.440]   to follow the show on iTunes.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.280]   It's really the best way to get the show.
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.160]   If you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes Store,
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:04.600]   which is confusing 'cause we're free.
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.760]   They ain't selling us, but that's where they stuck us.

[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:21.200]   and all the other shows that we do on iTunes there.
