[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And there isn't much news. We're still in that vacuum, that floating moment.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Kind of like, you know, the planes where you get to try zero gravity where they go up, up, up, and down, down.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We're right at that point. We're about to go down, down, down, down. And there's just everything's in stasis. Andy Enoco is here to talk us down.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hi, Andy from the Chicago Sun Times. Hello, or to just, you know, let's make a quick death.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's a death spiral. None of the stuff where you're contemplating your broken body and your on-trails. Let's just make sure, boom, there's nothing to collect.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Go! Front to the Everglades. Boom! Also with us, Andy is, I'm sorry, Alex Lindsay from the Pixelcore.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Hey, Alex, good to see you. Hello, hello. Good to be here. Mr. Renee Ritchie is not here. He's mysteriously taking meetings in San Francisco.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Mmm.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Evidently, there must be very important meetings to not be hanging out with us.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, he could, we're just up the road to peace, but...
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I know, but, you know, I wonder what's going on.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Mmm.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Tim Cook says running Apple is sort of a lonely job. God, I feel bad now.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Sort of a lonely job with extreme compensations.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Well, he does say no one should feel sorry for a CEO.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah, and it's lonely at the top. They always say that.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   This is a... He's been given interviews lately. This is an interview with the Washington Post that came out this week.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I'll be honest, I just couldn't get through it. So, if you guys, first of all, like a lot of these interviews, like last week's interview, we talked about a lot of pros.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Well, this one is really substantive. The one we were talking about last week, it was mostly...
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The one we were talking about last week gave you the impression that someone was able to sneak in 10 minutes and they had us really stretched that out and something like a feature.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   This really looked like it was not only substantive, but also like the writer had the ability to come back later and ask him to elaborate or on some points.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It really was one of the most introspective interviews with Tim Cook, I've seen.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   This is one of those interviews that not only for substance and length, but also for how well it was put together.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It was, I clicked the little K in my chrome bar to make sure I get it. I save a copy to my Kindle because it's very, very readable.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Cook55 chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama draw.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Though he has favorite phrases, many things are deep. And Apple's mission is always his North Star.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   He issues the jargon many CEOs use. And while he's quick to Trump and Apple, he's also unassuming, quickly noting after saying his job can be lonely that I'm not looking for any sympathy.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   CEOs don't need any sympathy. Well, let's walk through it then. Let's get the high points.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He does admit that he hired the wrong person initially for Apple retail. This was after Ron Johnson left, right?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And it sounds like what we had all assumed. We knew that it was a complete golfer clash between...
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We've all forgotten his name. Before Angela Arran's. A guy from Dixon's.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Have you ever been to Dixon's in London? You would never assume that that would connect with Appright.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   So I have bought things there. And it's not the same as an Apple store.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   He says the North Star has always been the same, even as under Steve, which for us is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way in rich people's lives.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Our reason for being hasn't changed. I love hearing him say that. I'm not sure I'd agree that that's what they've been doing in the last few years, but that should be their goal.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's something that's very, very good for a CEO to be heard saying in depth review, in depth, like this.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   But with Apple and particularly Tim Cook, you definitely believe it. Or at least I certainly believe it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Oh, I think he's dead on it. That's one thing you've got to give Tim Cook.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And also it syncs up very well. It syncs up very well with what he's saying throughout most of the rest of the interview is that it seems as though a lot of the hits that he and Apple tend to take are based on people not under the internet.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   People not understanding that Apple is really in whatever they do. They're in it for the long haul.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So if they don't come out with something, he talked about the Princess of PDAs that that was not just netbooks, but PDAs and all these categories that were not just simply flashing the pants.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   They were actually really, really good products that helped a lot of people that got that were very, very useful. But nonetheless, whatever articulation of an idea, the PDA or the netbook was, it wasn't the story.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It wasn't the sort of thing where 10 years later, people are still going to be using that sort of stuff. Whereas Apple is going to hold back their characters that they're going to hold back until they find the thing that people are going to be still using in 10 years.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And sometimes that could be frustrating for analysts. It could be frustrating for users. It could be frustrating for shareholders.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   If they really want to see that ender and product that once again, very useful, very, very practical, but not the sort of thing that Apple wants to dedicate the next to a five or 10 years on.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   There's a lot of real meat here. And a lot of it goes back to some things that we knew about Apple all along, but we've never seen it articulated by one person quite so well.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I really like to, when he starts talking about Steve and the job of being his successor. I mean, I don't think that one of the things that sort of frustrates me often about Apple executive interviews is that they're often very, very guarded about how they're feeling about anything.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And that you don't really get a sense of, you get too much of a sense of here's the mission that I'm trying to complete by giving you this interview, as opposed to I'm here to give you an actual interview.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I've actually highlighted this part of it. You see the question, you succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes, which we've heard articulated a million different ways.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   But he says his responses to me Steve's not replaceable by anyone. And then in parentheses, noting that his voice softens here. He was an original of a species I never viewed that as my role I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time because he was going to be chairman work a bit less after he came back up the health curve.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So I went into it with one thought and then weeks later, six weeks later, whatever, it was very quickly. The day he died was sort of the worst day ever. I just, I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I convinced myself that he would bounce because he always did.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So in some ways, Tim is the reluctant leader of Apple. I think, you know, I have huge respect for Tim Cook. And as I said, I get his integrity. He says one of the things that they've changed is they've brought a lot of social responsibility to Apple, which is something that was lacking under Steve Jobs.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   When asked, is the iPhone, you know, the fact that the iPhone is now three quarters of your business, is that a problem? He says, no, no, that's a privilege. He said, a smartphone is a one to one product. He says, don't, you know, a TV. There's one, you know, per household or a couple per household. But, but we, but this is a privilege. What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product for a consumer like products product will be one to one.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And that means, you know, he says a lot of people are focused on 90 days on the quarter, but that means in the long haul, this is the level of performance is going to skyrocket and there's nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or the intermediate term.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And I think that I think that also when you look at app installs and so on and so forth, you really the the issue is is that that revenue while it may not keep on growing as, you know, end up year over year over year is also not going to erode very quickly either.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Right. People are using the operating system. They're happy with. They bought a lot of apps for it. They're not going to go anywhere anytime soon and making sure that that that process is comfortable with these, you know, move from one phone to the other.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   All some makes it much easier. I mean, it's so seamless to go from one from an old phone to a new phone that so it really isn't a process. But this is, but this is the reason I bring this up is this is if I have a criticism of Tim and I realized who am I to criticize Tim, but if I have a criticism of Tim as a Apple user and Apple lover, it's that he's a great caretaker.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   He's a great operations guy. He's got a lot of integrity. He's a great, you know, he's a warm, wonderful person. But he doesn't have that spark that to take Apple to the next thing.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I think Apple and I don't know who an apple does. I don't feel like Johnny is Johnny. I was really even very much present anymore. So I'm wondering where is that that brilliance going to come from that takes Apple next thing.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And he says, and this is interesting, that he doesn't want to chase the next thing. He says, I'm not saying we're not going to do anything else. I'm saying the phone is still on a smartphone. It's still an unbelievable product category to be in and not just for this quarter, year or for years.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So I wouldn't want to think anybody thinks this, Oh, better days are behind us thing. So what he's really saying is we're going to stick the course and yeah, I would expect that from Tim. But I do think you have to have some.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   You want to see some sparks of innovation, something new, don't you? I think that even under Steve Jobs, we didn't really see that many new products. I mean, you know, we saw like Steve had with the original idea.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   But let's grant that Steve is unique, but he did pioneer several categories. The iPad, the iPhone, the iPod. Those are all massive game changers. And one, but it's, but they didn't happen over. You know, they didn't all happen over a five year span. I mean, the, no, I understand it takes time.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I think the car is going to change the world. I don't think so. In fact, I think there's some great question where there are apples even got the capability or the drive to make it happen.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It's there. There are two different questions here. And one of them is that I think that it's, I would definitely not want to be in Tim Cook's shoes, where it's not enough that I just do good work. It's not enough that I don't do the electronics that people like.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I'm saying this, it's a unique kind of pressure. Again, I'm so pleased by the insight we're given into what it's like to do Tim's job day after day. He talks about how the relationship that Apple products have with their customers.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And he's talking about personal stuff like not him not being really completely aware of how tangible that kind of relationship is. The first time he talks about the getting emails from customers, not just my phone sucks.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Why is this work? Why is this working properly? But like, thanks to FaceTime, I was able to be with my father when he was dying. And because I could not be, I couldn't travel 3,000 miles.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   And that's the sort of thing that I think really affects what he does day by day. I don't think that he would have chosen that to talk about in such a large interview if it hadn't really hit him in such a such a big way.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But the other problem is that it's not enough to just again be doing your job exceptionally well. You have to be really wonka people people casting you in this work.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   I think the big difficulty is that and we see that here too. I'll personalize this one because it makes it easier to explain where people like to on our four person panel.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It's an easier story if it's here's the one person who's a true lover of Apple and here's the person who hates Apple absolutely. And here's the person who's sort of above the fray doing this.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   When actually that's we switch off that role all the time, minute by minute by minute, but it's easier to tell that story. And people want to tell the story about how Apple is this company that is going to be, it has this big bag of wiffle dust that they sprinkle over creating
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   absolute magic as opposed to a team of engineers that works exceptionally hard trying to get things right and a huge company with enough resources that they know that they can build whatever they want at their slightest whim.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And so they can't just do things on their slightest whim because once they push that boulder off the top of the of the mountain, that's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and pick up more and more speed.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And before you know it, you're building something that's incredibly stupid, but you put 18 billion dollars into and half of that being a huge marketing push with billboards on every bus kiosk.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   But this has always been the case with Apple, which is I would like to cut some slack and just simply say, make good products, make things that you believe in, make things that have a point of view.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And it's okay if this isn't something that we haven't seen in a while Google can Google can do that Google can create, well, just this week he was discovered that they have on GitHub, a brand new operating system that could be used for damn near anything.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And with Google, it could even be this is an idea they're playing around with, they think in five years time it might be useful for something they might be making, or it might be something that they just wanted to do as an open source project.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   When Apple does something, it's no we have it.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   We're fixated on the idea that this is going to be something that's going to be tangible and sellable in two or three years.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Right.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   So that's a big yoke for them to wear.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And I think that Apple is held to a different standard than a lot of other companies.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I mean, we whether it's not that all of their stuff works all the time, but it oftentimes works for a longer period of time and more stable than a lot of other things out there.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And I think that that puts an incredible amount of pressure on the fact that you can't just put out something that you're going to, you know, you're going to get rid of.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   You know, you can't just put out something that, okay, that doesn't work or something that, you know, and when it does when they have an issue with their maps when they have issue with iTunes, you know, they're really taken to task over it probably at a level that's higher than many other
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   companies that are in their field where, you know, and so I think that for them, it's also this, it slows that process down.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I know that, you know, for, you know, we do live streaming and we have a very high success rate and we're very, we're very connected to it.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Like, like, we really don't want to do take chances that would have us fail, you know, and I think that I see the kind of that parallel where, you know, they have to put out a product that is going to work for a lot of people and it's going to be easy.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   You know, the, you know, the products that, you know, I haven't really tested a lot of the other watches.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   So I don't really know if the Apple watches any easier to use than the other ones.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I will say that I have almost every device that you can plug into your TV and the Apple TV is the only one that my kids really understand how to use.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You know, they have all the other little controllers laying around and they just, they just keep on going back to the Apple TV.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And so, you know, those are the things that Apple tends to do well as make it simple and make it stable.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And I think that that is, is takes a long time, you know, it's a lot of development to make that those two things happen consistently.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   You know, and I think, yeah.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But it's also why that it's also why Apple Pay could do well and the car could do well.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So do you use, I mean, it does sound like what Tim's saying in this interview is stop pushing us to do new things.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Let's just, we have a lot of runway steel in our existing products and we're just going to continue to make those better.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   That's not what I got from it.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Okay.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Does he address, you know, the future of Apple?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I think he, I think he says explicitly that, of course, you know, that I'm not going to talk about products, but he talked about, I think the car obliquely in the sense that here's how Apple works, that we do really try to find a way to make a product in existing category
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   more relevant and easier and more accessible and more helpful to people.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And you can look at certain, I'd have to search back to see if he explicitly said the car, but I think he said, I believe he said that you can look at the, you can look at cars and think about ways in which we would apply that.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   So, again, I don't think that it's like, I don't think he was, he was suggesting that Apple no longer has a responsibility to innovate.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I'd think that he's consistently been saying that we are not a company.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   If our money and our success gives us an advantage, it's that we don't have to build something just because we think this is a good idea right now.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Again, if it's something that we're going to build, we're going to believe in it, and we're going to sell it when we think it's ready to go.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And that's, again, oftentimes that's a little bit frustrating because it means that Apple gets in late and lets other companies kind of define the category.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Again, like Amazon has with the Amazon Echo, but on the other hand, it does mean that by the time they get into it, you don't want people, they are artists, I think, collectively.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And you don't want an artist that is doing something simply commercially.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You want them to paint your family's portrait once they feel as though they've cracked exactly how they can approach this and do something that they are excited about painting and exciting about doing it.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I think that Apple, within a certain realistic parameters, is exactly that same way.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Collectively, they don't want to build a voice device or a home device until they have something that they're really excited about having inside their own home.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   So again, they're not like Google, which to their credit likes to experiment and they like to build things for the sake of the process of building something.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Apple likes to say for the next three, for the next 10 years, we are in the business of building this incredible new transportation platform.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   We're not just going to simply license a battery technology, license a platform for rolling stock, get a deal with a pin for Ena to design a body and then contract this out.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   We really want to do something so that in 10 years time or 20 years time, we are really excited about this thing we're putting out.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   So that's their character. And so that's what happens.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   And when we see a new category is open fairly explosively in wherever they go, a lot of that is because we trust as users, we trust that the new thing that they're putting out is really going to work and it's been thought out and it's been processed.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Sometimes it turns out that it's not as thought out as we'd like it to be or some direction, but we generally have a general level of trust that we may not have with a lot of other companies where with a lot of other companies, when they put it out, we'll see how the reviews go,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   and that's the slow process where when Apple releases something, that's how they sell lots of them is a level of trust.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It only takes a couple of missteps to lose that level of trust and that guaranteed customer.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   There's no question, "Cook and Apple are very disciplined."
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And I guess that's really the only question.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Is this discipline, and it is very disciplined, and I'm sure very tempting for him in interviews, say, "Oh, you ought to see what we got, but very disciplined."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   In fact, at one point, the Post asks him, "Name one product or project of the past five years that you've canceled."
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And he says, "I don't know if I want to do that because it gives a competition some heads up.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I should be assured we have more than one because the wonderful thing about Apple is there are many ideas about doing things.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   We have resources to do a few, but you can only do a few things deep and well."
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I love hearing that.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And so you have to say no and have debates about what things are in versus out.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I just would rather, I want to be reassured that this is disciplined and they're not frozen in action because they can't decide.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And it's impossible from the outside to tell.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   It looks like discipline.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   It looks like they're thinking long, they're thinking hard about what the next big thing is.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   But what you don't want is an Apple that's stuck in stasis because we're making so much money on the iPhone.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Let's just keep doing more of that.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   If that were true, then they would be churning up so many iPhones.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Not just in quantity, but they would be Samsunging the iPhone.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   They'd say, "You want us eight inch iPhone, great, we'll give you an eight inch iPhone.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You want a flip phone iPhone, great, we'll give you a flip phone iPhone."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Because they think that everybody wants iPhones.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   We're not going to leave a single penny on the table.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   The fact that I've certainly spoken often enough about how I really wish that Apple would find a way that they could make their own iPhone.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   They could make their philosophies compatible with making their technology available to people who can't afford luxury level technology.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   But nonetheless, I think it says something that they are not making a version of the iPhone, for instance, for the Indian market.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Or for other markets where you can't really compete with Android by trying to sell five, six, seven, eight hundred dollar devices.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Well, again, that could just be stasis.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   That could be hide-bound versus discipline.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   It's hard to say.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   You're right.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   None of us work at Apple.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   None of us...
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   We don't know.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I was about to say something that I shouldn't say.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   But none of us work at Apple.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And we can only go from the fact that we spend so much time thinking about it and observing everything we are.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   We are obsessive about it.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Exactly.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   On some levels.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Well, as devoted users, as fans of a company...
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   The version of Apple that I understand, if I've got a clay model of Apple,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I look at it and that thing that I've got in the corner of my office is not the company that's sitting on its laurels.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It's the company that is having so much fun on its own campus, looking at the projects it's doing and figuring out that,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   yes, we've got so far with this version of a certain device that we actually have 500 of them manufactured and still in homes of certain executives and certain employees that they're supposed to return them.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   But they haven't returned them yet.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Please return them because they're the property of Apple. If they turn up on eBay, you're going to get sued.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   That's things of that nature.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   But the success is not in having developed that device and now it's in stores and millions of people are using them.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   The success is that this helped them to understand the next thing that they have to make.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   The next iteration.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They felt as though in the end it was an unsuccessful product or at best it was just one of those.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   There are a lot of people who are making this and we're making one of these two.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   But at least in making it and also manufacturing it, they understood this is an opportunity.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   There's a new opportunity we wouldn't have realized unless we went down this path.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   So I think a lot of their excitement actually happens just inside the campus of the things that they build and don't release.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I don't think I've yet to see any indication that they're resting on their laurels.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Lord knows that I've had enough complaints about Apple over the past two or three years.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   But I would not in any way say that they've been lazy or they've just been saying,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   hey, who cares if we're making this much money, we can just put it on autopilot.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Well, I think that also that the ecosystem that they're slowly cultivating I think is something that is also a key piece of this.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And for instance, the watch is a good example of something that I wasn't sure if I needed it.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But I'm not going to buy one for an Android because I'm using an iPhone.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So I need as a whether there's great Android ones out there or not is almost irrelevant to Apple because of their ecosystem.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And so they know that there's a huge number of iPhone users that may also want to watch.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And the easiest way for them to integrate it is for Apple to build that.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And so then they're going to build that watch.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And it literally didn't happen.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   But nothing is a lock.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   At any point, you make a mess. Let's say you don't put a headphone jack in your next phone and the market just rejects it.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And there's all these Android choices out there.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   You can't just sit there.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   The market may reject it, but I know Apple users.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I'm greatly doubt.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   But that would be a mistake for a company to say, hey, we don't have to worry because we've got such loyal users.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   That would be a mistake.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I think that I will guess that there are many people at Apple that are very stressed out about the idea that they're going to take that away and are going to spend a lot of time and effort.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It's a gamble.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   But if I was going to lay odds, I would say the odds are more likely.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I'm not saying overwhelming, but more likely that Apple's move in 10 years kills the headphone jack more than Apple's move kills the iPhone.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I think that if you're taking odds on which direction this move is going to go, we look back on.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I will take odds in the opposite direction. You want to bet?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I think the headphone jack will be here in 10 years.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I think that would be...
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   No, I don't think it'll be here, but I think it will start this conversation down the path of...
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   If Apple...
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I don't think the headphone jack is the CD-ROM or the floppy disk. I really don't.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I agree with that.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Also, there's such a thing as I prepare for Gears to Grind, but one of the things that helped same-sex marriage, achieve such momentum, is the fact that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts decided to acknowledge the constitutional right of two people to get married, no matter what it says on their birth certificates.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   A lot of people that quite innocently could not imagine how that would work about having legally recognized same-sex marriages saw what happened in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and realized that, well, what do you know? The world didn't end. Nothing changed.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Suddenly, they went from being mildly interested in what would happen if that happened and having mild concerns to, "Okay, we absolutely don't care."
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I think that when Apple deletes the headphone jack, I don't think that I'm 100% not convinced that they are ahead of a trend. I'm 100% not convinced they're not deleting a feature that fewer and fewer people are using.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I think they're doing it because they have the ability to do this, but I think that a lot of device manufacturers are going to realize that Apple deleted the headphone jack from the iPhone, and the world did not end for them, that there were enough people that some people used whatever did still happen.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   It hasn't happened.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   That's what I believe will happen.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   I think that we don't know.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I'm sure Apple has done a lot of research to decide that this is a viable thing to do.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I joke about having that clay model of the prototypical figure of Apple over there, but good enough.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It takes about two or three years to hear about the real fights that happen inside Apple.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   I will hear those, I'm sure.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   There was a lot of fighting about how we can't do this. This is stupid. This is pointless.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   People are going to make fun of us and they're going to be right to make fun of us.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Tim mentions, as you mentioned, that he has made mistakes. He hired the wrong person for retail and to Tim's credit acted quickly.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   He said, "I'm proud we did that. A lot of companies would say, 'Oh, he hasn't been here very long. Let's give him some more time.'
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But he says, 'When you're looking at more time than 50,000 people in retail, that's a lot of people you're affecting in the wrong way.'
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   He says, 'That was a mistake. I probably have a long list.' He also acknowledged, as Eddie Q did in the last interview, that maps was a mistake.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Today, we have a product we're proud of, but we had the self-honestly to admit this wasn't our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   It's not that Apple doesn't make mistakes. No one doesn't make mistakes.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I think that this is a signature of the 2016 version of Apple, though, that they are perfectly okay with having the CEO speak this openly.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   They're also perfectly okay with, again, even joking during WWDC about how some things didn't work out as they had hoped or planned.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I can't help but wonder what would have happened if the antenna problem with the iPhone 4 had happened under this sort of regime.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Would they have had the... appropriately, I think, had the gusts to simply say that, 'Okay, people are holding it the way that they say they're just normally holding it, and the battery signal strength goes down to zero.'
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Obviously, the only two explanations for this are that either there's a problem with the way we designed the antenna or there's a problem with how we coded that signal strength.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Either way, we're going to work on a fix for it, and at minimum, you're not going to see it in the next iteration of the iPhone hardware.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Of course, you'd want them to say it in a way that doesn't cause people to not want to buy an iPhone for a year, but I believe that Tim Cook is the sort of person who would simply find a way to say that, obviously, we're not going to tell people you're holding it wrong.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Obviously, we're not going to make fun of anybody who has written about a problem with this antenna.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   We're going to figure out what the problem is, and we're going to fix it because we want to have the best phone that's out there.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I actually missed that feature of the feature of it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I haven't done any excuse for how... I'm sorry, I just can't hear you.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I'm having trouble hearing you that you have to go ahead and say, 'Cause you hang up, it tells them you hang up, but if you lost signal, it just says you lost signal, and then you quickly turn your phone off, because you put a hand and it turned your phone off.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Battery died.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Battery had... I went through a car.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Not only that, but there's about halfway through, there was a part which they're asking about.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   It's a follow up to the questions when they're talking about when he wrote that op-ed piece, and he publicly came out as a gay man, and he's talking about how he, on so many of these larger decisions, he actually seeks advice from other people.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   You know that happens, but part of the mythos of CEOs is that, no, they walk the parapets late at night, the lonely man, or woman who bears the crown of state, and he talks about how, for instance, oh no, it's the next question we're talking about problem.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Who do you turn for advice? Whoever I can think can help me when I was going through the question, what should we do on returning cash to shareholders? I thought, 'Who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias?' So I called up Warren Buffett.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   I thought he's the natural person.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   It's incumbent on a CEO, not just to listen to points of view, but to actually solicit them, because I think... And he said this earlier too, he really values his interaction with... He may be lonely, but he doesn't want to be insular.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   He values his interaction with customers. And I also very grateful to hear that as well.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   This is one of the... I was just going to say, this is one of the network advantages of when you get a certain position in your businesses, that you are able to keep on expanding if you're willing to take advice, because you get to talk to the right people.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   You get to ask the right people in a way that you have that access that he has to get all that advice if you're willing to take it.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   He has almost unlimited activism. He called Obama if he wanted to ask about how to deal with people complaining about it.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Yeah, they will have done that.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I thought it was really sweet. At the end of that run, he's talking about all the people he was consulting with for the decisions.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I also went to Lorraine, Steve's wife. Lorraine has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And this is part of what makes someone a good head of state. And Tim Cook is a head of state, the nation of Apple.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   This is something that we have to be thinking about as we're considering who's going to be our next president, because it's not...
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   You can easily make fun of somebody who says that this person has to be a good communicator. They have to be a good talker.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   They have to be good on camera. But that's part of your job and that as a user of an iPad Pro, I am never going to be able to know exactly what's going on.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Understand every metric and the decisions that go on with whether or not my hardware gets upgraded or whether or not I should take a risk in getting an Apple Watch or something like that.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   It's important for the head of state to be able to communicate. We are not simply taking your money and then laughing at you because we're moving on to something else that if we designed a remote for the Apple TV that you thought was very, very clumsy and hard to use,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   it's not because we put design over functionality. Here is what we're thinking when we're designing all these sort of devices.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   You might think that that's not something that they really have to do, but it's much better to understand that here is somebody who is...
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   It's nice to have faith in somebody, but it's nice when someone doesn't demand that you have faith in them and explain why they do the things they do.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   That makes them not just more human, but you come to understand your own decision-making in a much, much more progressive and tactical way.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   The post also asks, "By the way, I'm saying the post, there is one author, one byline on this and it's Jenna McGregor, but..."
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Enough familiar with her, but this is one hell of a great interview.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   If she thought all the questions and asked them all and conducted the interview all by herself, then kudos.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   But my guess is that it was an editorial board or some larger group that's at least picking the questions and probably asking them.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   They don't say in the interview, in the article, they don't really say.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   I don't know what the style is.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   They say she wrote the story.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Yeah, I'm not sure what the style guide is at the post, but I would be...
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   If the convention is that if there are other people who contribute to a story, they get at least a with additional contribution by.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And so I will assume that she was entirely the conductor of this interview and the author of this, although like Tim, I'm sure that she consulted with people just like anybody would if they're going to have exclusive time.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Again, this is a such a... I know this isn't a... We're not talking about her instead of Tim here, but not only these good questions, but they're well thought out.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   The follow-ups are very much on point.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I'm sure these were edited, but they don't look like they were clumsily edited.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   This is really top-notch work, and I hope that that's reflected in her pay envelope and in whatever rewards they did put her up for.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   This is an exceptionally good interview.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   She asks about the comments that we referred to a couple of weeks ago from Joseph Stigless, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, calling Apple's profit reporting in Ireland to fraud.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Tim says, "I didn't hear it," which I find hard to believe, but okay.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   He says, "But if anybody said that, they don't know what they're talking about."
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   But this is... I think more importantly, this is what he says, "Our marginal rate, our effective rate in the U.S. is over 30 percent, where the largest taxpayer in the United States.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And so we're not a tax dodger. We pay our share, and then some.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   We don't have these big loopholes that other people talk about.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   The only kind of major tax credit we get is the R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies in the United States.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   That's important to know.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   The second thing I would point out is that we have money internationally because two-thirds of our business is there.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   So we earn money internationally.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   We did not look for a tax haven or something to put it somewhere.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   We sell a lot of product everywhere, and we want to bring it back.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He says the reason we don't bring it back is because it would be double taxation.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   It would cost us a lot of money to bring it back.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   But he says he expects the Congress to fix that, and he's optimistic that that will happen next year.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   So, yes, some really good questions.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I mean, I wonder, like, we haven't heard much about Apple's lobbying efforts, but there's a lot of stuff in this interview about him taking on social issues.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   It would be interesting if Apple decided to put some public lobbying money into.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   We want to start -- we can't build phones in the United States because we don't have the manufacturing here, but here are a couple of product lines that we could move at least a lot of the assembly work to the United States.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And we want -- we're going to lobby Congress to get some rules change that would simply make it easier for us to do so.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Not necessarily more profitable for us to do so, but if there are --
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   If there are mechanical and practical constraints, we want to see if we can find a way to move those jobs stateside.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I think the problem with it -- with that is that the real challenge, if you look at how the Mac Pro is being produced and you look at the trajectory of Foxconn, most of the assembly lines aren't going to exist with people from --
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   by the time they went through the process of getting it okay through Congress will take two or three years and then building a factory in four or five years, all of that whole system will be largely automated.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   So you have better paid people who are managing machines that are doing all the work.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And I think that is -- I mean, that's the trajectory that the Mac Pro took.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   That is definitely the trajectory that Foxconn is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on right now is -- that's their response to being told that they're not treating workers better, as they will treat the workers that are left better.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But they're moving heavily into automation.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   So I'm not sure if there's a large number -- and this is a general problem for manufacturing, is when we say those jobs aren't coming back.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Those jobs -- many of those jobs may not be available to anyone in, you know, 10 or 20 years.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Well, they'll be -- it's -- if anything, does that mean that there are a lot of parts of the country where manufacturing was tied to the fact that they are, for instance, a rail hub, or tied to the fact that they are close to this natural resource that would cost next to nothing to move from where it is to where the stuff they manufacture is.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   When you have shipping that is so ubiquitous, so easy to handle, and when you have machines that could be pretty much produced anywhere, when the limiting factor it seems to be, can we cite this factor in a place where we can generate enough energy that we can be green and self-sufficient?
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   There are a lot of urban areas that need revitalization, and people that can certainly be trained to operate this machinery.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   The amount of train that goes into sheet metal work is just -- is pretty outstanding.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   The SMROC would be hiring 5,000 people, but we're hiring 800 people to not just operate these machines, but also to maintain these machines, but that's 800 people.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Well, I think that the railroad of the future is really the internet speed that everyone has access to, and I think that one of the things that we haven't really thought about is really considering or thinking out the idea of a digital quote-unquote-unquote "a"
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   "digital" quote-unquote "digital" blue collar worker, which is there is enormous amounts of work that are not -- you don't need to get a computer science degree for.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I didn't go to school for what I did, and I ended up working on films, and I, that was me learning how to do this mostly on my own and reading books.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   And what we do in -- we try to explain what we do in Rwanda with our school there is it's a digital craftsman, that's what we're training for.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And the idea is that we're not trying to give you a degree, we're not going through a four-year program, we're figuring out how can you get work tomorrow, doing, you know, whether it's live streaming or whether it's print production or, you know, all these other things, web production, these are things that do not need a four-year degree.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And these are things that we need to spend more time on, but this kind of digital blue collar solution is something that I think could end up providing a lot of work, and the problem is because we don't really focus on that, most of that work is going to go somewhere else.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Because we're not, you know, we're not focused on that, we're not focused on the education that's required, we're not focused on the infrastructure that's required to provide that in the United States, where it could reside and not be -- you're not making $80,000, $100,000 salaries, but you could be making $15, $20, $25 an hour, you know, doing a lot of different things.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And that making that workforce available could also energize a lot of other businesses that, you know, right now are producing really bad signs.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And you walk down the street, you look at all the -- every time I see a bad sign, I think that there's still opportunity out there for people to be doing that.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   When I was in Turkey, almost all the signs were in comic sans. Is that what you mean by bad signs?
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Okay.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   This morning, I went after breakfast this morning, and a friend wanted me to try this hot sauce he had discovered, and I looked at the label, and it had the bitmap version of the Mistral font with underlining the label.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And I thought, "Oh, Lord, I had to say that I have to believe that this is not good sauce."
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   No, no, it is good sauce because they're more baking the sauce than about making the label. That's the sign.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   How good are they making sure that, like, the rat holes are plugged up inside the walls?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   They pay attention to the sauce, not the label, that's the key.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Anyway, I want to thank Jenna McGregor, the Washington Post.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Well, it was the bitmap Mistral. Come on, a man has to have standards.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Please.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   I want to thank Jenna McGregor, the Washington Post, and Tim Cook for giving us something great to talk about when there is very little news as we get ready for the Apple announcement.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   At the end, though, he says a couple of things that I think are actually kind of interesting.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   She asks about augmented or virtual reality. He ignores virtual reality and says, "I think augmented reality is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   So, yes, it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind that curtain we talked about.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   I thought that was very interesting. She then says, "What about the car?"
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   He says, "I can't answer a question about something we haven't announced and laughs."
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   She says, "Isn't it tempting to share some kind of details?"
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And he says, "Tim says, "We've always viewed people love surprises. We don't have enough surprises anymore in our lives."
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Thank you, Tim Cook, for giving us some surprises or at least holding back.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   I think it's quite a disciplined interview. That's one of the reasons I mentioned last week.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I just don't read CEO interviews because I never expect anything.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   But this was surprisingly juicy, really, for major CEO.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I have the same thing. Again, with last week's interview particularly, that's what I've come to expect.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   It's hard for an interviewer in that position to...
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I've been in that position. I don't do a lot of CEO interviews, but I interviewed the CEO of ASOS.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I interviewed Jeff Bezos a couple of years ago.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   You really do have to... When you're sitting there in the outside room waiting for that moment,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   you have to keep pinching yourself and telling yourself, "I'm not here to make sure that I don't get thrown out after the first five minutes.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   I'm here to take advantage of this opportunity that I have."
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   It's not just her time and Tim's time that gets wasted.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   It's the opportunity where Tim was obviously in a position where he was willing to answer some substantive questions.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Boy, did she come through with good probing questions.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   When you get these interviews and you see that, "Oh, would you rather fight 50 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?"
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   "Oh, good. Thank you."
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I see that we visited Reddit sometime in the past eight years.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   That was a good use of all of our time here.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   He also says, and I'll wrap it up with this, at the end, that he focuses on three things, and he does it every single day.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   People's strategy and execution.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I think that's a good description of what a CEO needs to do.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   He says, "But the most important one of those is people. If you don't get that one right, it doesn't matter what energy you have in the other two.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   It's not enough."
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   That's the kind of guy you want to work for, right?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   It's hard to not be impressed by Tim Cook after reading this interview, and I do encourage people to read the whole thing, start to finish.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   We're going to take a break. Come back with more. We'll find something else to talk about.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Thank you, Jenna, and the Washington Post.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Our show today brought to you by this.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Oh, I love this little do-hickey. Look at this thing. This is a tracker.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Actually, this is kind of a special tracker. This is a Mac break weekly tracker.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   The tracker is just a coin-sized, and that's about a quarter-sized device,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   that you attach to things you might lose, like remote controls or smartphones.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Actually, you don't have to. I'll explain why you don't have to attach to your smartphone.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Now, you get that for free. You might attach it as I do to my keys.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   That's the thing I don't want to lose, and I lose so...
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   I have it on my keys.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   So, this is...
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Say again?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I lost my keys constantly until I got this thing.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   You lost your car once, I remember.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   I just put one in my car.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   The worst part was I lost it at a liquor store, which was...
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Not impressive.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   I had not had anything to drink. Really?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   But it was hard to explain that to the police officer.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   My car's gone.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   No, it's just the liquor store.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   See if you had a tracker. Actually, there's a funny point in this interview where Tim Cooks says,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   "I don't drive to the airport anymore. I haven't done that in a while."
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   But I always used to lose my car, and Jenna says, "Well, I just take a picture of where I'm parked."
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   He says, "You don't have to anymore. Siri will tell you."
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Well, if Siri doesn't tell you, your tracker certainly will.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   The tracker Bravo is the latest iteration of the tracker.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   It's Bluetooth LAs. There's a couple of things about that.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   First of all, that's very low on battery life consumption.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   That means this will go a whole year.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Then it doesn't wear out. You just put a new battery. This is not a disposable.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   The other thing I love about it, because Bluetooth LE is communicating it with your phone all the time.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   That's kind of how the tracker works. You pair it to your phone, and the phone has a map of where your tracker is,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   and if it's attached to your keys, where your keys are.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Now, the one thing smart people, I know you're smart, are going to say is,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   "Well, that's fine if you're within 100 feet of your keys, but what if you go outside the Bluetooth range?"
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Well, then it gets really interesting.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Tracker has. There are a million and a half trackers out there.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   The largest crowd GPS network in the world. See, the tracker is always looking for people with tracker software on their phone.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   When it sees it, it says, "Quick, Leo, I'm lost!"
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   So you'll get a little ping on your smartphone saying your keys were spotted at this location.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   You will know exactly where they are whenever anybody walks by them with a tracker on the smartphone.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   And if you love this, that's what Bluetooth LE will do because it doesn't require pairing.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   It's very sweet.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And that large crowd source network means you can find your stuff,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   even if you left it at Casino in Las Vegas in your back home in San Francisco.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   It also has two-way tracking. There's a button on every tracker that you press.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   If you lose your phone, if you leave your phone behind, or it falls on the cushion,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   you push the button and your phone screams, "Help me, I'm here!"
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   You can actually choose whatever it is that you want to have screen,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   whatever sound you want. You can choose the ringtone, even if it's silenced.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   What else can I tell you about the tracker?
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Well, this is that you can get them engraved because it's standardized aluminum.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   This is the new Silk Screen trackers, which I think are really, really cool.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   You could personalize it with a custom printed image.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   They sent us the Mac Break Weekly logo. It's kind of cool.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And it's right on there. You know, it's like, I don't know what they're doing.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   They're silkscreening them on or something like that.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   They say it's UV. What is it? UV printing? I don't know what that is.

[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Renee Ritchie has the day off. Ironically, he's in town.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   But he's just sitting there, pursing his lips.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   He's, I guess, it must have been a secret thing.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Did he tell us he wasn't going to be here? Because I saw, see, Instagram tells all.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I saw his pictures of flying to San Francisco.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   And I'm thinking he's here for a briefing of some kind, don't you think?
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Annie, when would you get an invitation to the Apple event?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   It's one week before, right? Probably a week before.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   So I've said no enough times that I'm probably now at the level where I have to,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   or I should get in contact when I believe that I want to go.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Yeah. Yeah. You say, "Hey, can I go?" And then they--
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I've never been turned down. I've tried to be a little bit more selective about how I spend $1,300.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Well, that's exactly right.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   I've had three days of travel to go to San Francisco.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   And it's less important now, and I'm sure Apple knows that they stream everything.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You really get what you need, unless you want to hands on or whatever.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   And I have to say, it's fun to go to Apple events.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   You see great people. There's always a great show.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Especially when the new theater comes out.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Yeah, that's what I was about to say.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Amazing.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Yeah. If they just introduce new lightning cables,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   but that's the first event on the new campus,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   I think I will have to spend the money to go just to see it before it gets--
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Before we journalist ruin it with our funk and our ink.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   We just call that "think."
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   I find that we work with a lot of corporations.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   And what I'm always amazed by is that more don't take such care about having a one great theater
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   that's really going to be exactly what they need.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   With all the things and all the bells and whistles and everything else,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   it's just an incredible opportunity to project.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   And I think Apple's-- I can't wait to see it.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   It'll be--
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   It'll be--
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   It'll be--
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Yeah, and that's when I'm going to humble myself and call and beg and plead.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   That's right.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   I'm serious.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   If I feel as though I've got a card that I could play to either get the first look at the Apple car
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   or the first extensive tour of the campus,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   I would probably use it for the campus because I'm more interested in the campus than the car at this point.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Well, I have to say, some of my most cherished memories are being at that first iPhone announcement
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   that you'll never forget that.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   I'm really seeing Steve at any time.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   It was always something very special.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Particularly the expressions on his face.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   And it's just like, I don't know what it is about my brain when I'm looking at performances,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   even when I was at Cats last week.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   I'm not bored by what's going on center stage,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   but my eye is drawn towards the opportunity of,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   I'm going to look at the parts of the stage that they think we're not looking at to see if there's anything to see there.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Yeah, I do that too.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   And some of them end something.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   That's what's great about live, right?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   You can see it all.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   And the thing that I miss when I stay home and watch it on streaming is that it's fun during the Apple Watch event
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   to see Tim Cook just in deep, deep shadow.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   He's on the side of the stage after introducing the video.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   And you see him just bopping along and you see him not like checking his story.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   He's not like checking his watch, not like talking to somebody.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   He's actually like watching the video.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And it's not just to get his cue.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   It sees really engaged and interested.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And that really gets even more excited about what they do.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   I've seen I've been much, much closer at other launch events with also with CEOs.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   And you can see that it's like I've got this on my schedule from 10, 10 a.m. until 10, 20, 8 p.m.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   I'm required to be here, but I've got a car waiting behind the stage.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   You don't feel as though they've been looking forward to this day for the last four months.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   This is just the next thing other schedule rest, Tim.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   And particularly Steve, you can say that at this point they don't care if they sell three of these.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   So long as they get to be the master of ceremonies in this grand cabaret known as the iPad launch.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   By the way, Tim Cook's fifth anniversary as CEO is August 24th.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And when you look at the performance over the last five years, you've got to give Tim Cook a lot of credit.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Now admittedly, he's drafting a little bit on Apple and Steve Jobs Apple.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   But he went from $108 billion in revenue in his first year to $231 billion in revenue, more than doubling it for his most recent year.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   In other words, he doubled the size of the company.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Also increased employees from 60,400 full-time employees to 110,000 full-time equivalent employees.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   I think a lot of that's retail, but you've got to figure they've hired a lot of people for cars and other things.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Chinese revenue in the first quarter under Cook $4.49 billion, $18.37 billion for the most recent holiday quarter.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   And the stock, while it's been up and down, if you had bought a share of Apple stock in Tim's first day and sold it today, you'd make more than double it.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   I think it was 120% increase.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   That is his Kevlar vest.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   He used that line again during that interview saying that we feel as though when responding to the topic of some shareholders complaining that they're not releasing things fast enough and they're not innovating blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   It's like we feel as though we've made our shareholders quite happy.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   And the implication being that any shareholder who is unhappy with what we're doing can sell their shares.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   I think that they will find people who are willing to buy them off of them.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   And so that's really the best answer to that.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Nice to be able to say something like that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   And I think that you truly get the impression with Apple is that buying stock in Apple is not getting access to telling the driver which way to go.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   It's just that you get a seat.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   You get a nice little seat and you get to sit in the bus and see if it takes you somewhere.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   But you can get off whenever you like.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   But it's a bus and the driver is going to do exactly what he's going to do.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   It's not going to be super fast.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   It's not going to be, you know, we're not taking to a race course.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   You know, we're just going to go down this path.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   So finally, cash position.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Five years ago, I remember we were talking about, wow, Apple has $75.9 billion in cash.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Now they have $231 billion in cash.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   So all in all, I think Apple's doing a OK.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   I think if they if they wrote me a check, I don't think I would ask them to wait or like phone the bank to verify that.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   I would accept the person to check from that.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   And I still think that, you know, that number, the Apple number, I mean, of that cash is, you know, really allows them to be very disruptive if they choose to.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   They haven't.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   They've made lots of small purchases.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   But if you look at, like, for instance, Disney's market cap is 156 billion.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Apple could literally write a check for that, you know, for that, you know, for the, and buy all of Disney.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   You know, and so, and so that, and that kind of, you know, those kind of numbers, there is a good reason to have that kind of size that you could do something dramatic if you wanted to.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   Right.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   Although they never seem to want to.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   They're disappointing us.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   They could be such bullies with that checkbook if they wanted to.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Again, that's a discipline story, right?
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Exactly.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Well, not only that, but it's also, they're in the business of making things.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   They're not in the business of being a business.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Right.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   You know, there's a difference.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   There are other corporations that would say, and this is what we got in so much trouble in the 80s and 90s with so many different industries that the idea that, hey, we've got enough money that we can essentially hear our two and three up and coming companies that are going to give us some trouble.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Let us buy their man.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Let's buy their subcontractor out and then force them to find a new manufacturing line.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Or let's find, let's buy out this one component that we have absolutely no need for just so that we'll choke off the market for other devices that require this component.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   And they have certainly bought patents.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   They certainly have bought exclusive licenses to certain things.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   They certainly are famous for buying up, essentially owning the entire manufacturing capability for a certain technique, but it's always to make up to keep up with demand for their own products.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   So it's a clean, they've killed, but they've always been clean killed, clean kills.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Evan Dahl is back.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   He's the flipboard co-founder and he actually was working for Apple before they've rehired him for continued pushing the health initiative according to Mac rumors.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Yeah, Apple's back.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Oh, this is a good one.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Apple's been out bid on its bug bounty.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   This is exactly why Apple didn't have a bug bounty.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Apple offered what was it, 100,000, 120,000.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   Now a security firm, Exodus intelligence says, "Hey, we'll give you half a million."
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   This is exactly what Apple said would happen.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   They said, "We don't want to offer bug bounties because we don't want to have a bidding war."
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   And now that's what they got.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   So maybe Apple is right.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   What I want to know is that maybe during the September event when they, or at the next WWDC, when they talk about how many billions of dollars they've paid out to developers, are they going to include the money they've paid in these bidding wars for bugs?
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Yeah, that's developer working away, right?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Because if you offer a bug bounty, you're basically saying, "Go out guys and find something and we'll pay you if you do."
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   That's like pay.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   iOS 10, public beta 5 hit the street a couple of days ago.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   I don't see any big changes there.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   I think they're getting very close probably to the whatever you call it these days.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   The release to manufacture the gold master, the final edition.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   If we're on the same timeline that seems familiar for other Mac OS releases, we're now at the point in which everybody who's working on this is told, don't have a problem.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   This is told, whenever it's not working, we don't have time to get that working.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   We now have time to get everything that we have shipped so far and make it so that there are no more showstoppers.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   I would be surprised if we had news that there was a beta.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   Another beta came out that added functionality that wasn't present in previous betas.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   So if you've been to the World Trade Center, the site of the, of course, the 9/11 attack in the old World Trade Center where there's been a lot of data.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   The World Trade Center where there's a museum and the memorial, there is a new kind of a trades train station there called the Oculus Transportation Hub, which has a wild whale bone look.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   It's gorgeous.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   I've been, I've been there.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   You like it because I'm torn about it.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   It's, it's when you go inside as a, as a through way when you realize that people aren't going to be going here as tourists.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   They're going to be walking through here on the way to get from here to there. It's just, it's just filled with light.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   The spines make all kinds of really interesting shapes.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   It's an unexpected thing to see when you're walking.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   I was actually walking to taking the transportation hub through there.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   So as you're walking, you turn a corner and you suddenly see this thing, this organic bones of this ancient alien that has just been excavated.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   It's an unexpected thing.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   It's very, very positive, especially on a nice sunny day.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   It's something that I didn't really understand when I saw the models, but seeing it in place, I think, I like to see things that are unexpected.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   I don't like to see your basic boxes.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   I was a little torn, but I didn't get to go inside.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   So I think I have a picture over here somewhere.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   And so I, you know, it's, it's dramatic.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   Let's, let's put it that way.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   Here's my picture of it.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   And so you, you really can see that it's, it's a dramatic structure.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   This is right next to the 9/11 museum and the, and the memorial.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   Anyway, there's the reason I bring it up. There's going to be an Apple store in there.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   New Apple store will be opening August 16th. That's like tomorrow.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   No, that's today.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   Okay.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Well, next time you go see cats.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   See, I haven't been inside. So I, that does look like a, it looks cool.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   It looks like a very cool building inside.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Again, when you, when on a sunny day, particularly, you just see the light bouncing everywhere on there.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   I was, I was only inside there like a month or two ago.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   I wasn't even aware there was an Apple store going in there.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   So I don't know what the store looks like.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   It's, it seems like it's a wonderful, it would be a wonderful location for a landmark store as opposed to your basic mall retail store because it's, it's, it's really, it's an area that really now celebrates a dramatic pieces of architecture.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   So you could, I could only imagine a lot of drawings that, that architects, Apple's architects have been had to put on the shelf because they have not been able to talk any international city into accepting this, suddenly saying, maybe a little go for this one next to the, next to the bones of the
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   the alien, the, the alien chestburster.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Maybe this will actually look like it's a good addition to the block.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   The R&D center is going to be built in China by the end of the year by Apple, Irish data center. They've got to go ahead for that.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   So Apple's, Apple's busy on the construction front.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   That's for sure.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   We come back.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   I want to talk about the rumors for a new MacBook Pro.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   It may not be as soon as we would like it to be.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   But first, let's talk about Dina.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   I'm talking about Blue Apron.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   You know, it's hard.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   At the end of the day, you worked hard. It's five o'clock. You're ready to go home.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   And the last thing you want to do is plan a meal, shop for a meal and make a meal.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   And so that's why we are so often at our end up at the International House of Pancakes.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   This is probably not the best thing for you or for your family.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   So you'll love this Blue Apron does it all for you.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   They, everything but the cooking.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   They plan the meal.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   You actually could do it online and look and choose a recipe.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   They have new recipes every week.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   You'll ever get the same recipe twice.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   And then they send you in a refrigerated box all of the ingredients.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   Not more, not less.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   So if it's four asparagus spears, it's four asparagus spears.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   There's no waste to make that meal.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   And a beautiful laminated recipe card with all the instructions.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   They also have online on their website at Blue Apron.com.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   They have videos for techniques you may not know.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   And you can make it in less than 40 minutes.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   And you'll have this amazing, the house fills this beautiful smell.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Everybody comes and says, "Oh, what's for dinner?
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   That smells fantastic.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Oh, you'll see.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   You get this great experience."
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   And here's the amazing thing.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   It's actually less expensive than shopping at the store.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   The grocery store is 60% more expensive than Blue Apron because Blue Apron doesn't need the whole brick and mortar thing and clerks and all of that stuff.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   So you spend a lot of time eating out or at high end grocery chains.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   You're going to spend less than $10 per person for an amazing, healthy, home cooked meal.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   But there's more than that.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   It's also the experience of preparing a meal for your family or if you have a plan for two and a plan for families and for your spouse that you'll feel so good about.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Actually, Wheatley said I will cook them together, which is really, really fun.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Blue Apron has a mission statement I can really get behind.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   Their mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone while supporting a more sustainable food system, setting the highest standards for ingredients and building a community.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   You're going to get food from 150 local farms, fisheries and ranchers across the United States.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   The seafood is sourced sustainably.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   The beef is raised humanely.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   The chickens are free-range.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   The pork is raised naturally.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   And the farming practices that they use on those farms, regenerative, really great stuff.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   And you'll find in greetings you've never had before, like fairy-tale eggplants, shishito peppers.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   And it's hard to do these ads.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   My mouth waters every single time.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Because I think of the Blue Apron meals I've prepared.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   They're fabulous.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   You want three meals free?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   You can get them right now.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   They deliver to most of the continental United States.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   If you visit Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   That's three meals free and free shipping.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   Make sure you're eligible though because there are some portions of the US.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   I think Alaska doesn't get to.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   I don't know.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   Because they got to ship these refrigerated boxes.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   Blueapron.com/Twit.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   You'll pick your first three meals.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   Make them for your loved one or ones.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   And you're going to love it.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   Research shows Blue Apron families cook together any day three times more often.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   I'm not surprised.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   It's great experience.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   I've made a lot of Blue Apron.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   It's great experience.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   It's awesome.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   I mean, especially when I'm traveling a lot and you come back and there's a box there.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   I love that box.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   It's on the step.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   I know I love that.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   And you bring it in and you're just like,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   "And now it really is such a social experience."
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   Right.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   My wife, my kids.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   You have young kids.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   I think it's really important.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   We thought this was when our kids were growing up too.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   They not only have dinner at the same time together.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   That's a big deal.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   It's hard to do nowadays.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   But also that they see you cooking, that they participate in the cooking.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   It really is.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   And you can let them into the kitchen because there's a lot less swearing.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Yeah, you know what you're doing.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   And you don't go, "Oh, crud.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   I forgot the shallots."
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Which I do almost every time.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   There's always one ingredient that goes, "Oh, we were..."
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   And I'm sorry, you didn't...
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   We were here for it, but we had a little party to thank the staff for their hard work on Thursday.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   And I was going to make...
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   I was going to make...
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Oh, daiquiris.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Oh, oh, fudge.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   I forgot the limes.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   And it's like...
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   Where's that?
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   I had to go back out and get the limes.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   Yeah, it's...
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   This never happens with Loy.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Everything you need.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   All right, MacBook Pros.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   I am...
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   I want a new MacBook Pro, dang it.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   I don't need it.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Okay, then we've said this, and I think it's important to underscore.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   No one probably needs a new MacBook Pro unless you're like Andy,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   and you spilled soda pop on it.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   But I want a new MacBook Pro, and now I'm kind of salivating over the rumors.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Smaller footprint, thinner, not wedge-shaped, just, you know,
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   square thinner, bigger trackpad, high-end graphics option,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   and of course that OLED...
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   This is a rendering, obviously, not a picture of it on 9-5 Mac.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   I love this functional OLED function keys that would change depending on what you're doing.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   This is from Bloomberg.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   They leaked some shells, and Bloomberg had the story.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   Big trackpad.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   Look how big that is.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   That's almost a tablet at this point.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Yeah, I wonder if they're ever going to use that for bigger things like make it...
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   I think in the early days, I even had a graphics tablet that was practically that size.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Not a big one, but in terms of being able to put a stylus on a surface
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   and have a pressure sensitivity and being able to retouch photos and stuff like that,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   it could be... I'm sure it's as simple as making a comfortable surface for lefties and righties,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   but I feel as though there's a lot of functionality that's still left inside that trackpad
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   that hasn't been tapped yet.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   By the way, I love this, because of course, when we say Bloomberg, it's Mark Gurman.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   And 9-5 Mac, not having Mark Gurman, just reports Mark Gurman's reporting from Bloomberg.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   They have some of their own dad to this.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   I also have to say, the only feature that I need in that is a touch screen.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   Yeah, I just put it on my screen.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   I love touch screens, but you know...
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   And by the way, I saw on Twitter this week,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   "Divinder Harder War from Engadget" had a new ThinkPad X1
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   from Lenovo with an OLED screen.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   OLED touch screen.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   Oh, man, that's what you want.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   And unfortunately, I don't know if Apple, in the quantities that they'd like to make
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   in the quantities, there will be an OLED touch strip that will be dedicated to whatever is going on,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   which is a very Apple-y thing to do.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I like that idea.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   And Bloomberg also says, Mark Gurman, also says, "USBC ports."
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   And according to 9-5 Mac's own source, yes, the power button will have touch ID,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   which I think is great, too.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   I think that kind of security on a computer is a good thing, especially a laptop.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   Apple will be offering the AMD Polaris GPU as an option.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   That's higher performance graphics, chip than the Intel graphics.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   The design, the Polaris design, and I'm not familiar with it,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   apparently offers power efficiency and it's thinner, so they can make it thinner,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   20% thinner than its predecessor.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   Apple is considering bringing gray, gold, and silver colors to the new line,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   but it's not clear whether they will do so.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   If the report is accurate, one disappointment, the smaller footprint rules out
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   a larger screen, a 14 to 16, a switch from 14 to 16 inches.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   Although that, you know, I wouldn't say that because we've seen zero bezel displays from Dell and others,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   and I think that, in fact, that Lenovo had hardly any bezel.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   I think that doesn't mean anything.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   But that's all the good news,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   but it will not launch until after the iPhone event in September.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   That wouldn't be a new thing.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   They often will do, they've often done, excuse me, at least once or twice
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   before they've done notebooks on in October, November, particularly MacBook Pros,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   particularly now that they don't have like the big event and the little event in the fall anymore.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   So I wouldn't be surprised anymore, although they really have to have some sort of a roll out event for this.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   But if it does have all the features that they're talking about,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   because they want to have that event where they have Tim holding up on their hands
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   and maybe making sure it's perched on his fingers and showing off how the OLED display works.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   So it seems as though they're really going to have to have something,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   maybe something at Tom Hall, something with 150 people.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   But it's pretty exciting.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   It does once again make me wonder how does Apple Define Pro anymore in terms of a MacBook Pro?
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   I suppose the shift to USB-C kind of negates some complaints about ports in that
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   if they simply decide that we're just going to give you more and more USB-C ports,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   given that you're going to need dongles for everything anyway,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   we'll at least let you decide how many displays you want, how many USB 3.0 connectors you want to have.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   We'll let you basically define that because pretty much any kind of signal can be transported over USB-C.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   So as usual, it's both the heaven and the hell of Apple in that you don't have to.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   It really is a take and relieve it.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   This is going to be the MacBook Pro.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   You have the option of switching over to Windows if you would like,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   and you have all the choices you want.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   Or you could just simply stick with Mac and just learn to live with what we're giving you with the MacBook Pro.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   It looks nice, but...
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   I have to admit that the USB-C bought as a single port bothered me in the 12-inch
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   a lot more than I expected it to.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   I am so used to having something that can just fall off if I pull it or push it or sit on it wrong,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   or I have it sitting on my lap wrong or whatever, that I found that I definitely cramped.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   I just don't work with it.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   I just spend a lot of time in airports.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   So there's always this cobbled together thing, and you don't like it at all.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   I didn't realize how attached I was to the magnetic connector.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   My guess is...
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   Type C does not preclude a MagSafe adapter, and it does not mean one Type C.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   It could be multiple Type Cs.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   I think it's probably also about Thunderbolt 3, which presumably these new machines would support.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   That would be great.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   Although on a laptop I don't know how much I need you.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Thunderbolt 3.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   I love the Thunderbolt 3.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   Well, you know what's great for it?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   Because I bought a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   I should have told you that of the Akidio, and I put some SSDs in it.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   It's a great backup thing.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   You get home, you plug it in, you back it up, and now you...
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Because it's fast.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Right.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   You're right.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   What are you going to carry around a Thunderbolt 3?
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   Right.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   But a lot of people dock their dock.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   They're a dock.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   Right.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   And so that's...
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   Especially every developer...
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   Excuse me.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   So many developers I've seen, they have their home MacBook Pro, and they come in.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   You come to visit them, and they've got their standing desks with their 1, 2, 3 displays.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   And so there are going to be plenty of people who really want to be able to have multiple displays.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   Particularly if...
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   As Alex has pointed out to me, a lot of the video editing has gone from people editing feature films to people doing corporate videos, and people doing wedding videos, and people doing editing as private videographers.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Those people want to have multiple displays so they can show stuff to a client while they're working on something, or while they have a previous screen someplace.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   So it's one of the defining things of the Pro, I think, is going to have to be that multiple displays, even a crazy stupid number displays.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   There is a reason why they might want to do an October announce, because it looks like they're going to have, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, new iPads this year as well.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   And was a little confused at first, because he said 2017, "I missed the little F at the end.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   Fiscal 2017 begins in October."
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   So Apple is apparently planning a whole line of three new iPads, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, as well as an Apple Watch 2.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   So if you had those coming out as well, I think we're going to have an October event, don't you? I mean, that makes sense.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   That's a hell of a lot to throw up there.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   I think they're also going to want to remind people about that the Apple Watch exists and make people...
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   I think they want to capture a lot of the people that want an Apple Watch, but they don't want to be people who bought the very first one.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   And so it's a good time for the messaging to say, "And it's some small way.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Here are all the ways that this one is better than last year's model as a way of saying, "All you people that did not give us $400 last year, please give us $400 this year."
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   They make such wonderful Christmas gifts.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   Please buy $300 with the bands as well. Look at all the colorful bands we have right now.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   Well, see if any of this intrigues you.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   There'll be a new iPad Pro at 12.9 inches, the iPad Pro 2.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   Not sure what features that will have a new 10.5 inch iPad, which is somewhere in between the normal size and the big size.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   So now we have enough naming issues.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   We have iPad Pro, Maxi, MIDI, and Mini.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   I don't know.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   And then Maxi and Laverne.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   Maxi and Laverne.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   There'll be three sizes of iPad Pros and a low cost 9.7 inch iPad.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   Sounds like the iPad Air.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   Maybe, I don't know, maybe the iPad Air brand is dead.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   A10X processor, according to Ming Chico again, in the 12.9 and 10.5 inch iPad Pro.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   Soul Supplier TSMC, the 9.7 A9X, a little bit slower.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Revolutionary iPad model likely to introduce next year with radical changes in form factor design and user behavior adopting a flexible AMOLED panel.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   And the rumors have also been that next year's 10th anniversary iPhone will have a AMOLED panel.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   If that's the case, Apple's better be building AMOLED plants because really it's Samsung and LG that makes all the AMOLEDs.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   And I think they use all the AMOLEDs they make.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   I don't know.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   Maybe not.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   Although they've been doing much better, my understanding is that the reject rate is much, much lower than it used to be.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   And they get to keep a lot more of the ones they manufacture.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   So it's possible that they actually have increased capacity without actually having to manufacture any new ones.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   I love OLED screens.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   Don't you get used to that?
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   I just bought a new OLED TV.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   It's even a better TV.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   There's a time where I was a little bit more of an engineer when it comes to these things saying, "Oh, you know, you pour simpletons.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   I have to explain to you that no, that picture does not look better.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   They've just simply increased the answer."
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   And then you unpacked that, realize that I'm telling people that the fact that you like that image more than the other doesn't mean that you like that image better.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   And you're so right about it.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   I wouldn't want to necessarily be doing print quality photo editing based on an OLED display.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   But anywhere outside in the real world, particularly in an operating system that uses color really, really well.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Oh boy, when there's something red that a cheerful red boy does that pop?
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   And boy, does that make you...
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   I wish I could articulate just the pleasure sensation of seeing a beautiful working piece of interactive art that when it's an OLED display as opposed to LCD, it's just this.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   It just really just touches your soul much more quickly than it does in any place else.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   I have bought...
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   There's only a couple of reasons why I kind of wish I'd bought the Nexus 6P instead of the Nexus 5X.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   And one of them would be that I kind of like those really poppy colors.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   I kind of...
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   My Note 7's coming later this week.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   DisplayMate says it's the best screen ever put on a smartphone.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   And this is where Samsung and LG have a little bit of an advantage on Apple, frankly.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   I was at Samsung last week as well, and I spent some serious time with the Note 7 and, "Oh goodness gracious, it's just beautiful."
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   I wonder how much I have no idea what goes... I know that Apple goes into...
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Makes what stuff they want to make for the reasons they want to make it.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   I wonder how much they're being affected by the fact that if you just put an iPhone 6 and a Note 7 side-by-side, just an OLED screen behind it, the side...
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   The OLED screen just looks nicer.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   And you can make all kinds of very, very sane, rational arguments about how the more garish colors aren't necessarily best for the user.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   But goodness gracious, there's a reason why when you go into the TV department of an electronic store, they've got the really expensive ones set the brightness all the way up, the color saturation all the way up.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   And the ones they don't want to sell you, they've got certain things turned down because you can say that McDonald's hamburgers, they're loaded with...
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   Fat and salt and sugar, but we like fat and salt and sugar. That's why we buy hamburgers because we want to have fat and salt and sugar, even though it's not good for us.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Alex, do you dislike OLED screens for things like video and photo editing?
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   We just don't use them that often.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Can they not be calibrated to be accurate?
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   Well, I think that for us, we have two different types of monitors that we buy. So we tend to buy ones that are, for the most part, we buy monitors that are very accurate, and we pay a lot of money for them to be very accurate, these color accurate monitors.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   And they're like $2,000 for a 17-inch screen kind of thing.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   And then everything else is just kind of the cheapest thing we could find that's 24 inches or whatever, because we just want to see the screen, we don't really care.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   And actually, we don't want people to think that we don't want people to actually look at that monitor and make decisions about the cameras based on that.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   There's like one monitor in every system that says, "This is accurate. Go refer to that one before you start talking about whether the cameras are on or off."
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   And so, and I don't know if that's the best solution. It's just been the solution. So a lot of our stuff has not been...
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Not really been that. The cost of those monitors kind of falls in between those. It's not as cheap as the cheapest thing that we can buy, because we destroy a lot of monitors.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   I mean, we kill a couple monitors a month. And so they think, "Well, you've got to remember, we take these fly kits out, and these are getting put into Pelican cases, and then they're handed to TSA, and then they come back, and they don't all come back alive."
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   So you do the best again. We've got a very sophisticated process of plexiglass that is velcroed on top of the screens, and even then we lose them.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   And so then we work outside and they get walked. We've had a couple that got rained on at a couple conventions.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   And so there's all kinds of things that happen to them. So we just kind of...
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   There's the ones that we take very, very good care of, and then there's the ones that are kind of...
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   I mean, I shouldn't say disposable, but they're definitely not something that we want to care too much about.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   I wonder if people, you know, hearing now about the next generation iPhone and iPad, and OLED screens and all that,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   I wonder if some people are going to say, "Look at the new iPhone," and say, "You know, I can wait a year."
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   It's not a talk. It's a TikTok.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   TikTok. I kind of think that we need to get ourselves out of the mindset that there is a TikTok-Tok release schedule.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   Clearly. That was super reliable for a number of years, and now I think that will lead us to...
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   I've seen too many pieces over the past couple of years that have really forced people, certain people to say,
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   "Oh, of course, this is a talk release because although it has a new fingerprint reader and a new camera and a new CPU,
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   and the styling has been changed, they move this," they didn't give it a hover mode.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   You still have to put it on a tape. It's not quite true.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   I think... I'm sorry. I didn't come to the point quickly enough.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   I hope that people get into this mindset of every time a new phone comes out or a new tablet or a new anything comes out,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   they say, "Here is my phone as it is right now. What does it not do that I wish it did better?
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   The problem is it not being able to solve for me?"
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   Or, "What opportunity does the new version of this phone create that I would have without..."
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   And I wouldn't have it on this old phone.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   I desperately want people to not simply say, "It's been two years since my last phone. I'm buying the new phone."
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   You have to make them earn it every single time.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   I think the market is big enough that there is a lot of laggards out there.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   My company being one of them, I mean, while I get the new phone off,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   the company issued phones fall a little further behind.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   We're going to buy a bunch of phones this fall.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   I'm just trying to see what the new one... I don't want to buy one now, like this month,
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   not knowing what's coming out on the other end.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   My wife has an iPhone 5 and every time she sends me a picture, she gets back.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   This would look a lot nicer if you had a new phone.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   And so we're kind of...
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   No matter what it is.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   It's me.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   You're so used to...
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   I know.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   I know. I know.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   And you're so used to these gorgeous photos that you're getting out of the 6S and 6S.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   And they're high res, and then my wife said these little snapshots from her 5 and you just realized that was like a dark age back then.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   And so I think there's a lot of people with iPhone 4s without iPhone 5s.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   And they do reach... I think they were iPhone 4s that were like everybody had.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   The last time we did a major issue, we had phones in the company.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   And the batteries aren't working anymore.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   We've lost a couple of them.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   And so it's time to do that upgrade.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   And I don't think we're the only ones.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   I think that there are other companies or people that have held on to their phones as long.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   And there's going to be some little thing that has the upgrade.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   I mean, for me, upgrading after one year, you know, because I haven't upgraded every year.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   You know, there have been definitely years I looked at it.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   I was like, no, not going to do that.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   Even, you know, I think it's a year to take a year off.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   I don't know. It depends on what they put in.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   If they open their headphones...
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   I don't care about the headphone jack.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   I'm fine.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   I think that's a one-two punch though.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   You don't have a headphone jack and you've got the promise of an OLED screen and maybe other advances this year.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   I think for everyone that's going to be something kick over point, I'm much better at camera.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   And again, I don't know if you persuade me...
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   Supposedly much better camera this year, right?
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   Because it's got dual cameras, which we don't know what that's going to do.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   That's the theory.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   You know, I bought the M8 or M7 or whatever because it had the two lenses and you get this kind of pseudo-depth of field, which is really cool.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   But I think that also, you know, can I draw on the screen?
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   Drawing for me is a big deal because I give a lot of feedback.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   So there's a lot of things where I get graphics and I have to draw on them and send them back to people.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   And right now, I find myself opening it like, "Oh, I've got to go to my iPad."
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   I open it up and slack and draw on it and then send it back to them.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   You know, because I have to leave my phone or leave my computer and go to my iPad to make sure that I can annotate it.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   You know, and so that's the...
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   You know, I think that can I draw on it?
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   Is it going to have a better low-light performance?
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Is it going to have better images?
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   I think those are things that are pretty key factors every time with an iPhone that's going to drive...
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   I think those are the factors, in my opinion, that are going to drive sales as far as upgrades.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   I don't know what else they would upgrade significant...
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   That would make a significant impact on people.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   I think the headphone thing will definitely impact them.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   I mean, there'll be 10%, 15% of people that don't buy it because it doesn't have a headphone jack.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   But I think most people that buy iPhones are a little go, "Ah!"
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   And then they'll buy it anyway.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   Grumble grumble.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   Alright, here's your thousand dollars.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   Oh man.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   Yeah, it's a...
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   You know, and the same thing was like the 30-pin to the lightning.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   Everyone was all upset and, you know, they had to buy all the stuff.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   But you have to admit that the lightning is a lot nicer than the 30-pin.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   I mean, my kids still have old iPhones.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   No, I agree.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   You're like, "Oh, this is horrible.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   Like, yeah, we used to do this."
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   Oh my God.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   We've been through this discussion before.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   I think the only thing I didn't say over the past two or three weeks that we've been talking about this is that
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   I'll refer back to something that I said earlier that it's a lot of people...
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   When Apple deletes the headphone jack, it's going to convince a lot of people and a lot of people whose job it is to talk about
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   whether these decisions are good or bad or going to say that this is a bad decision.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   It'll be one of those people. I'm definitely going to be a good surprise.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   But the world will continue to spin.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   It's not as though anything's going to get destroyed.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   It's not as though it's good.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   It seems as though every single upgrade you get to anything will include having to lose something that is a really, really good feature
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   that you really, really liked.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   And despite the lack of any evidence that it was necessary to lose this feature, it's going to happen anyway.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   And as always, you will have to decide, has the removal of this feature made this device so ordinary to me now that I can easily switch
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   to another device because suddenly the iPhone is not a very special platform to me.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   Finally, we've found a job for you, Andrew.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   Apple is hiring a lyrics curation manager for Apple Music.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   I could just see you in that role.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   As you know, the iOS 10 is going to have song lyrics alongside the song that's playing.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   So there will be an entire curation content lyrics curation team and a lyrics curation manager.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   No, they're not just going to take them from rap genius.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   They're going to carefully check them for spelling.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   And I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   You'll have to have it.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   It's it's yeah, it's it's kind of I was only literally yesterday that I proved to myself conclusively that the Stevie Wonder song line is for once I can say this is mine.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   You can't take it.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   I've for my life, I thought it was you can take it.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   Right.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   Meaning that I love this person so much that I'm saying to me, but sure, but absolutely take whatever I have.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   So I think this is going to be like, well, this is by the way, in the job description, it says you must have
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   a passion for technology, a will to question the current workflows, the mindset to improve tools and processes, but most importantly, should be able to accurately and quickly transcribe lyrics.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   And you will be using new and complicated tools and processes.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   Wow.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   So does that mean by transcribed, does that mean that they're going to build their own database by listening to the music and some or just.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   They're going to buy the sheet music, the published version of it and then copied over.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   I don't know.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   I don't know.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   But I think that, you know, like for instance, if you go through the process of figuring out what they actually said in it's the end of the world as we know it by who are.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   There's a lot of interpretation, you know, because there's a, you said, in my family, there's a heavy competition around lip sync.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   And so, and of course, you know, I mostly go for, you know, kind of like gymnastics, I go for for the difficulty rating, you know, and so, so, you know,
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   ones like that, it's very hard to get all those lyrics just right.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   And so it's, so I think that I think that the lyrics thing will be a huge feature, but I can see how it can be difficult.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   You might have to look at it.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   It's like looking at translations.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]   You might have to look at six or seven lyrics and then listen to it and make a decision.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   You might even have to use audio analyzation tools.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   Very famously when Linda Ronstadt decided to record the Rolling Stones Tumbling Dice, she actually went to Mick Jagger and said, what the hell are you saying?
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   Would you write this down?
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   [sings]
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   We're always on, and I...
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   Get ready.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   You're picks of the week, gentlemen.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   The last Mack break weekly from the Brick House studios are moving up to the East Side next week.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   And I don't know what it's going to look like, but it'll be good.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   Our show, and by the way, I think we're going to do, thank you, Alex Lindsay, a 360-degree surround sound version,
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   or surround video version of Twit this Sunday, the first show from the new studio, which should be interesting.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   You'll be able to look at all the holes in the wall.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   It only happened once.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   People holding up girders.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   It'll only happen once or twice.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   Our show today brought to you by the Ring Video Doorbell.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   I have mine right here.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   Actually, this isn't mine.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   I have mine on my door.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   The Ring Video Doorbell is awesome.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   We've had ours now for quite some time.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   It was an easy, peasy thing to do.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   You just take off the old doorbell.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   We had wired doorbell, and this is designed for either wired or unwired.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   And you just unscrewed the old kind of funky doorbell.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   And put this one on there.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   They even give you everything you need in the Ring Video Doorbell kit, so you have the right tools to do the job,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   including the right-sized drill bit, even in the screwdriver handle and the special Torx.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   Tip and all of that, including a USB charging cable, because it does have a big battery in it.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   So if you don't have a wired doorbell, you can also use it last a year, which is nice.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   Look at this, even a level in there.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   I mean, they think of everything.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   Easy to install.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   It took me about, well, I'm not a handyman.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000]   So it took me a... I read the instructions.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   That took me half an hour.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   So maybe an hour to install it.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   But then, what's awesome is your doorbell still works.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   Somebody presses the doorbell and still rings in the house and all of that.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   But this has a wide-angle camera, HD camera, and speaker and microphone in it,
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000]   so that you can answer the door, not just from your smartphone, but not just from the other end of the house,
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   but from anywhere around the world, because it's on the Internet.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   So that's awfully cool.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   You never miss another delivery, a package, or a bad guy ringing your doorbell to see if you're home before he breaks in.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   "Hey, what's going to... Is Molly live here?"
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   No, no, Molly here.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]   Okay, wrong number.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   They slink off head hung because they can tell you're home.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]   Except you're not. You're not.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   You're in France or wherever.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000]   The Ring Video Doorbell now has a bunch of other solutions to go along with.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   The Ring's expanding, so they've got the Ring Pro, which is a little slimmer, lighter.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000]   It doesn't have the battery, so if you know you have a wired doorbell, you can use the Ring Pro.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000]   And it gives you, by the way, a 1080p picture.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   Both of them have motion detection, so you don't just have to wait for somebody to ring the doorbell.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   You can look around and see who's out there on your front porch.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   You can actually go there on the web, or actually send a web application.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000]   I think there's a Mac application, a Windows application, Android and iOS application.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000]   And when you open the application, you can say, "Well, let me see what's going on right now."
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   It'll turn it on for you.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   It'll also contact you if somebody rings the doorbell or somebody's moving around outside.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   There you have a great deal now on what they call their Ring of Security bundle.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   You can either get the regular Ring or the Ring Pro and get $50 off.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000]   You also will get the Stick Up Cam, which is a Ring without the doorbell.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000]   It's a camera that has a speaker and microphone, so you can monitor the rest of the backyard, or wherever.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   You know, you want to put it.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   They call it the Stick Up Cam because it doesn't need wires.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   You just glue it up there.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   And it comes with a solar panel that keeps it charged, which is really, really sweet.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000]   And the bundle also includes the Chime, which is a -- you plug it into the wall.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]   It's an additional doorbell ringer that you can put anywhere.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   So this is a really nice bundle.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   Either get the regular Ring or the Ring Pro bundle kit and $50 off when you go to Ring.com/MacBreak.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   This is a great gift for family members, for anybody who wants to keep an eye on what's going on.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000]   If you're planning to travel, this would be a really great thing to have for the -- before you head out for the summer.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   I was walking to work this today, and I walked by a house.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   But this guy needs a Ring video doorbell and a Stick Up Cam.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000]   Can you see this picture on my screen, Carsten?
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]   This guy really needs some help.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   He apparently is very nervous.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   He's got -- it says, "Corsion, children of play neighborhood, watch no trespassing.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   Beware of dog, big lights, and a camera."
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   This is on the corner of the street.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   All of this could be accomplished with one simple Ring video doorbell.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   I'm tempted to just knock on the door and say, "Here, can you have this Ring?"
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   Ring.com/MacBreak.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]   Ring.com/MacBreak.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   No need to be paranoid.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]   Just keep an eye on things with Ring.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   It is now time for picks of the week.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   Let us start with Andy and not co.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   I got two quick ones.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   Google Duo.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]   They're a one-to-one video chat app.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   Just dropped -- I have it on mine.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000]   It's starting to -- I don't know if I've got you set up, though.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   It's a really cool -- I'm sorry.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   It's a really good for Google video, video one-to-one, co.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]   It's a little like -- it's like FaceTime only.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000]   You don't just get one -- you don't have to just talk to people who use Apple devices.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   It's cross-platform Android and iOS.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   It only works on phones, it only works on devices that have a phone number attached to them.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   It's not as though you can do this on the desktop or on your tablet or on other things.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   It really is just for phone-to-phone communications.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:45.000]   But the cool thing is, is that it really is all about all the features that they did not put in.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   It is just a button that says "Video Call."
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000]   You see a live stream.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   You touch the "Video Call" button.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   Uh-oh, we're getting feedback.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   I better turn mine off here.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   That's probably me.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]   [laughter]
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   Keep going.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   Keep going.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   I'll just turn off my send.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   It's a button that brings up your address list and you just tap the person you want to talk to.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   It has the -- the only really cool interesting little feature is what you're seeing right now,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   which is they call it "KnockKnock," which means that your phone rings -- if you've got the app installed
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   and someone's calling you, the phone -- the app rings, but you see the person just kind of like the people
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   on that Ring doorbell just sort of like waiting for you to pick up the -- pick up and answer the call.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   So you get to see the person before you answer.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   So if you see that your friend Leon looks like he's kind of drunk again, he needs someone to pick him up
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   from the side of a road.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000]   You can decide not to talk to him on that -- on that occasion.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000]   You can also turn off that feature if you want on your end for privacy.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   But it's not designed to be the end-all-be-all of video conferencing.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   Google Hangouts is still a thing.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   It's just there to give you that sort of very, very simple touch a button.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:59.000]   If you have a technophobic relative, this is the app that no matter what device -- excuse me --
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   no matter whether they have an Android device or an iPhone, touch this button, touch the person's name,
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   you'll be talking to them very soon.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]   All the standards that are behind it are really --
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   I'm calling Karsten right now.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   So there you go.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000]   Karsten, that's why we're getting -- I don't know why we're getting feedback.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000]   I've got my mic --
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   I'm not --
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000]   You're Mike Karsten, by the way.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000]   Maybe that's the reason.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   Maybe that's the reason.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   Yeah, it's on your -- on the phone.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   Just tap the screen and you can mute the mic.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]   But it's nice.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   It's based on WebRTC, which is a completely open, free standard.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   So the transport is -- is rock solid.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   It can move from Wi-Fi to cellular and back again without interrupting the call.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]   It'll do that automatically.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   If the bandwidth is -- it's suddenly bems crappy.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   It'll just simply reduce the bandwidth of the connection,
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   or even just turn off the video entirely to keep it happening.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   Its calls are encrypted from end to end.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   It is really just that one button you push, but everything behind it seems to be really, really good.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   This is not that other app that they demonstrated at Google I/O,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   the one where you can have a robot join the conversation and advise you on -- advise you on how to get to --
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000]   How to get from the computer.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   It's not at all.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000]   Yeah, at all.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]   That's the weirdest thing about this.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   It doesn't interoperate with any of the other Google things.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   So it's just -- it's --
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000]   On the other hand, this is what FaceTime probably should have been because it's open.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000]   Right?
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000]   And it's cross-platform.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   FaceTime, you can only call other Apple users.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000]   This you can call Apple users or Android users, which I like.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]   That's super good.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   And it does show that there could be advantages to deleting features.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   Like, again, it's kind of annoying that you -- it really is tied to -- I've got it on my --
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   Obviously, on my phone.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   So it's tied to this phone and nothing else.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000]   I have to do it.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000]   Phone number specific.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000]   But that's --
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   It's funny.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   But that's so you don't have to have a Google account.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   You don't log in your Google account.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]   You just associate it with your phone number.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   And so they're really -- it's like FaceTime in that.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]   Well, no, it's better than FaceTime.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   It's completely unlike FaceTime.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   It just rings that phone.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   It's for that phone.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   But the nice thing about that is that one thing I don't like about FaceTime and iMessage
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000]   is that sometimes iMessage is really bad at guessing where I am.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000]   And it will ring it through to the absolutely the wrong place, whereas there's only one place
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000]   this call could ring through, and that's here on the phone.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   So it's a free app.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]   It's worth just getting on your phone.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]   It'll look through your contacts, let you know everybody else who has Duo.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000]   Not everybody has an iPhone.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   It's good to have it, to have that simple no-must-no-fuss app that simply will let you talk to your grandma.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000]   And it really eliminates the big problem with FaceTime, which is it's tied to all your Apple accounts.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   I mean, this is just basically point to point.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000]   This is like, you know, your calling, who you're calling.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   This is kind of cool too, you can do this. Switch back and forth.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000]   You can switch cameras, mute, that kind of thing.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   Yeah, that's kind of cool. You can go back and forth there.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:04.000]   All right, Duo from Google just came out today and is available for Android and iOS, and it is free.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]   So I have an anti-pick.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000]   Do not get this, whatever it is.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000]   It's just a good example of a media company that just didn't quite figure this out.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000]   So I don't know if you downloaded the NBC Olympics app on your iPhone.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   But I would like to talk about how stupid this app is.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   What's wrong?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000]   Okay, so I got it, you know, maybe I'll watch some Olympics, you know, and everything else.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   So number one is I get incessantly hammered with notifications on everything that's happening,
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   which I guess is kind of cool.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   But the problem is, is it says, now watch now.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   And what you're almost guaranteed is that you're going to go to it and it's going to either say that it's already done,
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   or it's going to put you on a screen that says it hasn't started.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]   And in addition to that, if you actually click through it, you only get like an hour.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.000]   If you don't have a cable, you know, I haven't had cable for a long time.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]   You know, I can't remember that when I had cable.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]   And so, you know, there's no way to pay.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000]   Like I would have been happy as, you know, with the Olympics coming up or whatever.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000]   I would have been happy to pay 20 bucks or whatever to just be able to watch whatever I wanted to watch, you know,
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000]   and but instead it's, you know, I put some code in that I don't have and, but it doesn't tell you any of that.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000]   And then then then you have a thing where it says, I'm now going to count down the hour that you get to watch,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000]   but what I'm counting down is a picture that says the event hasn't started yet.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:30.000]   You know, like, you know, like, like, it's not like, you know, anyway, so, and, and of course, I think I tweeted, you know,
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000]   after getting it and being kind of excited to watch the Olympics, I didn't really watch much of the Olympics because it, you know,
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000]   it wasn't really, you know, if you're a court cutter, you're not going to get much of anything.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:46.000]   And what I found was watching the highlights of Simone Biles was, you know, and Phelps was enough.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:53.000]   You know, like, I'm mostly Simone Biles doing huge jumps and, you know, watching the probably one of the greatest athletes that's, you know,
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000]   that's ever lived doing what she does.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000]   You know, I mean, like, literally, I mean, like, you know, just watching, you know,
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:05.000]   you know, just watching, you know, that, but those were all available, you know, and we knew how she did and we knew how Phelps did.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   And, and watching little clips was enough.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:15.000]   And I think that that's probably not the trajectory that, that NBC should be hoping for is having lots of people decide that they don't really need to watch.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000]   They don't care. Yeah.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   Yeah. Like, you know, like, oh, and then, oh, never mind.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000]   You know, and if they did it, if they do it one more time, like, you know, and then in two years, I think that they'd end up starting to,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   starting to trajectory, they probably wouldn't, wouldn't want to continue.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000]   People complain about the Olympics every single time.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000]   And particularly about NBC's handling of the Olympics every single time doesn't even make any difference.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000]   I, I, I, I, maybe the people were complaining or not that people were watching.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:47.000]   I, I just be interested to see, you know, how the ratings continue to, I'd be interested to see a year over a year on, on, uh, I think they're down this year, aren't they?
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]   Yeah. I think they are.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:56.000]   I can only speak to myself. It's like, I, I can understand that NBC has spent so much money for exclusive video rights to the Olympics.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:03.000]   That they've on a, on a rational intellectual level, purely, they decide that they have to be really, really possessive of those rights.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   But the thing is, if I were seeing animated, animated gifts in my Twitter feed, I would be thinking, Oh my God, I really got to tune in and see that.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000]   I want to see more of that.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000]   Whereas, okay, I guess I don't have to see that.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:21.000]   How, how nice beach volleyball they won. Great. And I just, instead of a, sorry about that again.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   I had the, I had the ringers turned off until about quarter past four.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   Yeah, well, we're almost done. We'll let the ringers. That the ring is big in.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:40.000]   Actually, ratings are down on television, but they are up online, big surge of online, which was exactly what you expect.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000]   I don't think that says anything about the Olympics, but more about how we watch TV.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000]   Yeah. Right.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:57.000]   And I'm with Alex. If I could, if, if for this event, if I could pay $20 to have access to here are six feeds, including Aqua shuffleboard, I would, because that's, that's the stuff I'm really keen on.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000]   I want to see stuff that is not really going to be televised.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   I want to see something that confuses me and part of the fun is learning the rules of how this works and figure out how anybody could possibly, how anybody having seen water polo at that level once would volunteer to be part of this.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   Oh my God. Water. Have you ever seen water polo? It's like, it's armed combat. People who are capable of treading water in the green water.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:33.000]   You're like taking your chance. And it's like, and understanding that like, it's like these competitors, they understand that the referees are not in scuba gear.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.000]   So whatever happens below the water line is perfectly okay. If you want to punch someone in the gut, that's fine.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:46.000]   On the women's teams, actually, I was reading about this part of tactics is to actually tear off like part of their part of their uniform.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   So we'll have to adjust it and get dressed again before they come back up. Oh, that's just good fun. Oh, by the way, the Olympics.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.000]   I've never, I'm not that tough. I'm not, I'm not one 20th tough enough to even practice water polo with anybody.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:11.000]   Olympics live streaming through Thursday reached 1.28 billion minutes on NBC, which exceeds both London and Sochi combined.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:19.000]   So what they are losing in the most important demographic, the 18 to 34 down 30%.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000]   That's where they may bode poorly for future Olympic games.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000]   They should have more lip sync battles and drinking games on there.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:37.000]   That worked well for the tonight show. Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of this fine edition of Mac Break Weekly, the last one in the Brick House studios.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:46.000]   Next week, we will be for better or worse in another venue. If the pool isn't green, I'll be happy.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.000]   Wait till they fill that with water and then you can pay and then you can pants me a not go.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   It's a studio. Water polo. We didn't tell you any.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:04.000]   All of all of Mac Break is just going to be water polo. It's funny too, because they were the littlest helmets, just a little tiny helmet.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000]   They can pretend they're Apollo astronauts.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   Andy and I go is at the Chicago Sun times and the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:20.000]   That's his personal site, C. W. O. B. Dot com. He's on the internet on Twitter at I H N A T K O on Instagram as the same.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:29.000]   No, yes, Andy I on Flickr. And look for him everywhere, because it's always fun to see what Andy's up to. Thank you, Andy, for joining us.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   Alex Lindsey, best way to keep up with Alex is on Twitter, A L E X L I N D S A Y on the Twitter, because he often announces interesting things you can participate in, like say, for instance, a 360 degree livestream of the Twits Studio grand opening.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:54.000]   Coming this Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday. Thank you, Alex. Thanks for being here. We appreciate it. We'll see you Sunday.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:03.000]   Sounds good. Thanks to all of you for joining us. We do this show every, I don't know if it'll be, we'll probably be on time next week. We'll see every Tuesday.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.000]   We weren't this week. 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:22.000]   On time is basically whenever we start, but we, you know, we aim for that time. You can also catch us on demand exactly at the moment you wish anytime, anywhere, audio or video.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:31.000]   Just download it from Twit.tv/mbw or your favorite podcast client. You can even subscribe so you don't miss an episode. Thank you all for joining us.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:37.000]   We will see you next time in the East Side studio, but for now, I'll be back to work.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]   Take time is over. Bye-bye.
