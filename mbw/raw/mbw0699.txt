[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700]   Joining us at the table today, Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700]   -Fix the core. -Hello. Hello. Hello.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700]   Renee Ritchie from imore.com and Montreal.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700]   -How news, Leo? -News! So much news.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700]   -Really? -Getting.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700]   -No.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700]   Okay.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.700]   Andy Naco from WGBH in Boston.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700]   And Lori Gill, also at iMore.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700]   How are your fingers after all the typing you did last night?
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700]   -They're doing just fine.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   -You survived, huh? -Yes.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   -Yeah. Congratulations.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   We were talking before the show about what is the continuing --
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.700]   the continuing SNAFU in Iowa, the Iowa caucus results.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   I don't know if they've even come in yet.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   But they were held up because -- and it turns out,
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.700]   I think now even Iowa's Democratic Party is blaming the app.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   This is an article just came out on Motherboard from Vice.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   Here's the Shadow Inc. app.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   Yeah, by the way, if you're going to get an app to do your elections,
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   is Shadow the company you want to go to?
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700]   -No. Shadow -- -And there aren't nope on that.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700]   -Here's the Shadow app that failed in Iowa.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   And they have done the best reporting so far on this app.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.700]   Here's -- they actually got a picture of the app.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700]   They were able to install -- well, they were able to install --
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700]   they tried it on two phones.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.700]   One, they were able to install it on one not.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   They talked to a precinct captain who was supposed to use it named
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.700]   Jonathan Green.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   He's the chair of the Democratic caucuses in Iowa's Fremont Township
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   and lone tree precincts.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700]   He's also an IT sysadmin.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   So, this is a pretty good, reliable guy to talk to.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   He said they weren't sent the app until -- or information
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   by the app until January 18th.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   They actually -- they were invited to test at January 18th
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   via a test ferry.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700]   That's for Android.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   There's also a test flight on the Iowa.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700]   It's a test flight on iOS, of course.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   And by the way, he wasn't able to get it to install on an iPhone.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   He was able to get it on install on Android.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   However, he wasn't able to log in.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.700]   Green, who uses -- this is from Motherboard -- who uses personal S7,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.700]   Samsung, said in order to report results he had to sign in with an email
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.700]   and a password, provide a two-factor authentication --
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   I'm guessing a text message -- because he then also had to enter
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   a one-time password from the Google Authenticator app.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   After that, he'd need to enter his precinct pin,
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   but he didn't get that far.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.700]   And this is last night during the caucus.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.700]   He was trying to report the results.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   When he entered the one-time password generated by Authenticator,
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   he got this error message.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   IDP caucus 2020.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   Oops, something went wrong.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   There could be a misconfiguration in the system or a service outage.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   We track these errors automatically, but if the problem persists,
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.700]   feel free to contact us.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.700]   Please try again.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   And then the address specifies an unknown protocol that the
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   browser did not recognize.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.700]   So it sounds like the install perhaps didn't complete.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   Three experts consulted by Motherboard said they couldn't
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   determine much about the issue based on the error message.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   And so because the Democratic Party in Iowa expected everybody to use
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.700]   this app, the app which they only gave training to people and information
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   to people about the day before the caucus, they didn't have a call center set up.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   They did say if we can't get the app working, we'll take -- you can call on
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.700]   us as we have in years past, but apparently that didn't work very well.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   And now they are blaming the app for the fact that they have to do a manual.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700]   At least they have -- hey, they have a paper trail.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   Right.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.700]   So they're blaming the app, but now they have to do the recount via paper
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.700]   to validate the results.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   The New York Times said the app wasn't tested widely before it was deployed.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.700]   Gregory Miller, co-founder of the open source election technology institute,
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.700]   quoted by Motherboard, is saying the app -- it was obvious the app was rushed.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.700]   He said, "I don't want to say I told you so, but --"
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.700]   I informed you thusly.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.700]   I mean, there were security experts for a month saying they're really worried
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700]   that this isn't going to work.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.700]   Because there wasn't any outside testing.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.700]   This is what Miller said.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   And this is what Miller does, right?
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.700]   He's election security.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.700]   So when you're vetting an app for something like this, you need to do load testing,
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.700]   regression testing, pen testing.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.700]   It's not just the app.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.700]   It's the deployment process.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.700]   No one should ever deploy an app like this and have a pop-up that says,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   "It isn't safe for your phone," which is by the way the pop-up that Android users got.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   It's a stock pop-up you'll get when you install something from a third party,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.700]   but still.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.700]   Right.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   Shadow apologized.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   Apparently, it has a Twitter.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   Shadow, Inc. HQ.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   We will apply the lessons learned in the future.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   I've already corrected the underlying technology issue.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.700]   You know why that's important?
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.700]   Nevada also is supposedly using this app and they're caucus.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   Hopefully that'll do some more training.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.700]   We take these issues very seriously and are committed to improving and evolving
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.700]   to support the Democratic Party's goal of modernizing its election process.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.700]   You know, also it's concerning?
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   West Virginia is talking about using an app.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.700]   They already have.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.700]   For the elections.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700]   Well, they used it in the last elections.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.700]   Well, it worked.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.700]   There's no paper trail.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.700]   That's the problem with the Internet voting.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   Are there any dangling chats?
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.700]   They simulate the dangling chats.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   Okay.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.700]   Well...
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.700]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.700]   This issue was multiple.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.700]   Hold on a second, Lord.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.700]   Go ahead.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.700]   It has to be mentioned that there was a first part of a five-part report,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.700]   the Intelligence Subcommittee on what happened in the 2016 elections really went into
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.700]   depth on what we need to do to fix elections.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.700]   I mean, we should say to improve the -- I would not say fix elections.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.700]   No, no, no.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.700]   To improve the safety and security of elections.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   They did mention that one of the most important features of the election is simple
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.700]   faith in the process that you have a system that is not going to be hijacked by
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.700]   anybody else.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.700]   And that's one of the reasons -- that's one of the reasons against having a voting by
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.700]   phone.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.700]   You need to make sure that if something bad happens, there is always a backup or there's
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   an ability for an independent outside agency, whether it's a public service thing or
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   they're being funded by someone to look at the data to make sure they know that
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.700]   nothing bad happened.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.700]   There was an incident recently.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.700]   I forget what district it was in, but they found out that a whole bunch of their
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.700]   touchscreen voting machines, they had like some dead pixels on like the left-hand
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.700]   side of the screen, so that -- and of course, anybody who tried to vote for a
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.700]   candidate who was inside the dead zone of pixels, it would not go through and would
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   be voted for somebody else.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.700]   And that was really, really bad, but it would have been worse if the machine had no
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.700]   paper trail so that when it was caught almost immediately by the election
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.700]   wardens, who immediately said, okay, I don't think that this candidate won by
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.700]   32,000 votes to 117.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   We are going to immediately throw out all the digital things and we're going to go to
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   a paper recount.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.700]   So that's one of the things that is -- it's just as important to have the
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.700]   appearance of a fair and safe election as it is to have an actual fair and
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   safe election, because otherwise nobody will trust the results.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.700]   It will always be a year's worth of recounts and court filings.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   So that's why you really need to test.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.700]   Lori, go ahead.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.700]   >> And exactly what you're talking about, Andy, as part of, I think it was more than
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.700]   just that the app didn't work for some people because, you know, we don't have
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.700]   the numbers on how many people couldn't download the app or couldn't log into the
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.700]   app.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.700]   But I think what it speaks to is our fear about doing something like this for
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700]   something that is so important.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.700]   So you kind of start with the election meddling issues that we had from the
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.700]   2016 election.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.700]   That's already put us on guard.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.700]   We're already afraid, right?
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.700]   And then you take a brand new bit of technology that people haven't even had the
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.700]   opportunity to test yet.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   So when it gets to that point where you download the app and it didn't work the
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.700]   first time, you give up, you make the phone call, or maybe you got it downloaded,
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.700]   but you couldn't figure out the password.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700]   You give up, you make the phone call.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:44.700]   There's many steps under which the fear of it going wrong, I think created a
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.700]   fervor of not even trying to make sure that it would work.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.700]   We're already a little bit afraid of like how our technology is working for us anyway.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   And I think this was just a culmination of a lot of reasons to doubt its ability to
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.700]   work right, causing people to just immediately switch over to, "I'm going to do it the
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700]   way that I feel safer and more comfortable with."
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.700]   I think maybe four years from now, this might work better, but right now,
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.700]   there was just a number of things that rolled into this ball of a complete
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.700]   failure.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.700]   That's what Alex was saying.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   It's kind of ironic because they were so worried about election meddling and
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   hacking that they didn't let anybody see the app, and then what bit them was the obvious
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.700]   simple stuff they have didn't work.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.700]   And the hard part is that almost all of this is correctable with process,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.700]   which wasn't here.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.700]   You're the king of this.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.700]   When you set up events like this, you know how to do.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.700]   I mean, this is what we worry about all the time.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.700]   You have to practice, practice, practice.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.700]   You have to push all the bugs out.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:53.700]   You always, I have never seen a platform of any size with any company launch and not
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.700]   have some quirks.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.700]   It's normal.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.700]   It's normal.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.700]   So you don't launch it a day before you actually need to use it in a mission
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.700]   cradle goal.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.700]   This is a year of development.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   It's three to five million dollars of cost.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.700]   It's reported that they paid shadow like $60,000 for it.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.700]   That's all.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.700]   Now maybe shadow was deferring that cost across a lot of other states or trying to.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:23.700]   They raised like $7.7 million in funding, but I doubt they spent it all on this app.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.700]   And so, you know, and I think that the place that we see with a lot of these apps,
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:35.700]   and I'm going to be a curmudgeon for the moment, is when the coders are in their 20s,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.700]   early 20s, and the people speccing it are in their 60s, you end up with this thing where people
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.700]   don't understand what they're asking for and people don't understand what could go wrong.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:51.700]   And so you end up in this kind of craziness of, and what we see here is people not being
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.700]   afraid enough of what's going on.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   They're so afraid of having the code not work or be hacked that they didn't think that it
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   was just not going to work, which is what really happens all the time.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.700]   It just doesn't work.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.700]   And it doesn't work for Apple.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   It doesn't work for Google.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   It doesn't work for Facebook.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700]   It doesn't work for Microsoft.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.700]   All of them have those bugs.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.700]   All of them have problems going on.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   And it's a normal problem.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.700]   But the thing is, is that that's the thing you've got to be afraid of.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.700]   It's more likely to have that happen than the Russians getting in to mess with your Iowa elections.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:29.700]   And so they looked at the wrong beast and ended up getting bit from a different direction.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.700]   Here's the from the shadow webpage, shadowinc.io.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.700]   Apparently they say their mission is to build political power for the progressive movement
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.700]   by developing affordable and easy to use tools for teams and budgets of any size.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:51.700]   They said in their statement from the CEO, Gerard Nimera.
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:57.700]   Sorry, shadow is an independent for profit technology company contracted with the Democratic Party
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.700]   to build a caucus reporting mobile app, which was optional for local officials to use.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.700]   So, you know, I don't think you blame shadow.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.700]   You can sort of blame shadow.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.700]   They're the tech people in this.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.700]   You certainly could blame management at the Iowa Democratic Party for not knowing what to do.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.700]   But they're not the tech people in this.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.700]   But I think that a lot of times what happens is you have non-technical people making requests
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.700]   and they want it to be done for 10 cents because they think that this is all really expensive.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.700]   And the thing is that what they're learning right now is that it can be really, really expensive
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.700]   because this is disasters for the candidates who are trying to get momentum.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:43.700]   You know, and the problem is that the Bernie followers got sandbagged on the last election
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.700]   and now they feel sandbagged again because they have to turn it back.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.700]   You pay a lot of money.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.700]   You go to Iowa.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.700]   You spend a lot of time on Iowa.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.700]   You hope to be the one that gets to give that speech in prime time before New Hampshire.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.700]   So the whole thing.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   And it's what, and it's 12 years ago.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.700]   And then it was announced in the Romney run.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.700]   And that was the end of his campaign.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.700]   You know, like, and so this is like, you know, and again, I mean, some big responsibility
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.700]   that Iowa has.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.700]   This is the last time.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.700]   They're never getting that chance.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.700]   They're never going to be first.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.700]   That's two now.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.700]   Two in your out.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.700]   Not only first.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.700]   And also, I'll be interested to see what happens in Nevada because apparently they're going
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.700]   to use this app as well.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.140]   And then on the about page for shadow, it says we are campaign and technology veterans who
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.700]   have built and implemented technology at Hillary for America, Obama for America, Google,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.700]   Kiva, Apple, the AFL-CIO and the DNC.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   I don't know.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.700]   But it doesn't have any names.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.700]   Renee Richie, or the Canadians laughing at us at this point.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.700]   Oh, God.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.700]   I don't know.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.700]   I mean, there's so few of us here to vote.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   It's a small state.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.700]   No state.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.700]   It's a state up north.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.340]   And we have elections at a non-set schedule whenever we go to the Queen and she allows
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.420]   us to have elections and we can take down a government with a vote of no confidence.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.700]   So it's a whole different.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.700]   Micha Gennon here.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.700]   I mean, this was a caucus.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   It wasn't a poll, an election.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.980]   It isn't a big election.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.780]   It's a primary.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.540]   If you're going to make mistakes like this, I guess that's not the best.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.940]   It looks like Nevada dropped it.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.940]   Oh, they've abandoned it now.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.940]   All right.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.940]   So there you go.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.100]   There's also a huge opening for someone with a really big microphone tonight to make fun
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100]   of, which is a...
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   We know who's going...
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   That's going to be.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.100]   And I think that's our...
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.100]   Which is going to be a lesson.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   Great.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100]   But it's targeted with someone.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.100]   You know what?
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.100]   That's not unfair.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.940]   His initial tweet, President's initial tweet was Democrats can't even run a caucus.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.500]   Are they supposed to run the country?
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   You know what?
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   That's not unfair.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.980]   Well, it does point out when the risks of having a built-in lack of faith in elections,
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:54.580]   if you... it creates the unprecedented opportunity for someone who did not like the result of
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.540]   an election to say, "I think that as... the responsible thing to do would be to remain
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.980]   in office until people have faith that this election was completely above board."
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.980]   That's right.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   And that's a scary thought.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.980]   That's not what you want.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.140]   I sure do hope nobody heard you.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.980]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.980]   There's no idea that there's an idea that's dead.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.620]   There's an orange binder on some shelf somewhere.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.980]   I don't know whether it's how to retain power or, "Okay, here's how we administer the tranquilizer."
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.420]   And here's the giant armoire.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.100]   We're going to hide the body and...
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.100]   [laughter]
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.340]   ...while we do so we can take it out of the light out.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:39.260]   The LA Times is saying that developers were a formerly Clinton tech team for 2016.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:47.020]   The Democratic caucus in Nevada is in just 18 days, February 22nd, they've already said
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.620]   they will not be using this app.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.700]   We will not be employing the same app or vendor using the Iowa caucus they had planned to.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.940]   We've already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems and are currently
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.860]   evaluating the best path forward.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:07.700]   I don't like the idea of sort of staying stagnant in this kind of thing like in our
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.980]   election process, but at the same time it is so important that if we can't get it right
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.260]   the first time we should just stick with what we have, you know, because that one seems
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:24.820]   to be more reliable and our election process is very important and it's not just kind of
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.100]   a matter of, "Well, we didn't quite get it right this year, so we'll try again next
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100]   year.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.100]   You can't really do that."
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:38.140]   I definitely, you know, I would like to see progress in the way the system is done, but
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.820]   I also would not want this to happen again.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.580]   So I think it was very smart for Nevada to say, "You know what?
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.300]   We're going to go back to the things that we already had in place, all these redundancy
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.540]   plans to make sure that we get this right.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.740]   We're going to just drop this whole technological thing and just kind of stick with what we
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.740]   know."
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.900]   I think that one of the things that's really important is finding ways to constantly hit
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.420]   something in the public without it being mission critical.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.220]   I mean, we run into this all the time.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.540]   So I'm going to, let's say, stream to a brand new platform and it's going to be launched.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.180]   You have no idea what's going to happen until you turn it on.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.940]   And so what we're always trying to look for is how do we do a bunch of things that aren't
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.140]   really visible or aren't that important?
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:22.380]   And if they fail, then we figure out what, you know, what we can fix.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.740]   But before we get to that one that actually matters, we want to keep on hitting those,
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.140]   because you just know you're going to run into those.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.300]   And just coming out of the gate with it is, and even the sample rate of all 50 states,
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.500]   to me, would be a very small sample rate to test something, even if they got all of them.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.780]   I mean, for something of this magnitude, they need to be doing hundreds or thousands of
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.780]   tests.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.100]   They need to think of a platform that they can use day in, day out with the public that
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.020]   is the same platform that they're going to use for something bigger, building something
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.020]   custom with this.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.020]   Celebrity quizzes.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.700]   Just like Facebook style celebrity.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.260]   Which game of Thrones character are you?
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.260]   Run it a million times.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.580]   Which friends character are you?
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:06.260]   I'm going to quote one of my great heroes, Helmut von Moltke, the elder, who said no.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.260]   Not the younger.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.260]   Not the younger.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260]   No, no, he was an idiot.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.780]   No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.380]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.620]   Or the map is not the territory.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.060]   And you know, my favorite one related to that is Omar Bradley that said, you know, amateurs
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.700]   talk about strategy and professionals talk about logistics.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.700]   Yeah, logistics, baby.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   You know, because it's just the sort of...
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.900]   That's what happened here was the logistics failed.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900]   There wasn't a hack.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.540]   There was this logistics fail.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   You know, here's a quote from CNN.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:41.180]   The Iowa Democratic Party pushed heavily to make this year's caucus a high tech affair.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.460]   They initially proposed a virtual caucus system that would see caucus goers.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.460]   You didn't even have to leave the house.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.020]   Use a smartphone.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.820]   National party officials, national officials shot that down over security concerns.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.980]   We talked about this on iOS today, Micah.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.660]   Even though we all love technology, we're technologists.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.180]   You ask technologists, especially security experts, they are always going to say the best
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.020]   solution is a technological solution, right?
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.060]   Sometimes a piece of paper isn't so...
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.060]   Yeah, they're scared of it.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.060]   Yeah, we're the first ones.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.300]   We know too much.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:21.340]   And the other problem is you can't assume that every single district has the money to upgrade
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.780]   to what does...to the sort of standards that people in a think tank would think is necessary
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.780]   to run an election.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.140]   It's the great thing about paper ballots is that it's easy to deploy.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.420]   The hardware is already there.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.740]   It is considered to be very, very reliable and suddenly asking a district that can barely
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:46.140]   afford its educational budget to please pay $780 each to replace every single of your
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.140]   voting stations with something that's up to date, that's a really big ask.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.380]   But it's money that can come from the Democratic National Committee.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:21:01.180]   And something that is the most important election in the last hundred and some years, it would
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.700]   have been to their best interest to make sure that it worked.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:11.300]   The other problem is going to be every time there is a way to unilaterally make an election
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.140]   system better, there will always be the calculus done by one party or another to say, "Ooh,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.500]   this might cause more voters who vote against us to get an opportunity to vote and therefore
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.100]   on principle we're going to block this from happening."
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.180]   It's just a really, really big mess and it's going to be...it's going to take a revolution
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.020]   to really fix all the problems.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.980]   This of course from the always on point, Randall Monroe, this is not a current one, but it's
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.660]   still very apropos.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.740]   Asking aircraft designers about airplane safety, nothing's ever foolproof but modern airliners
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.460]   are incredibly resilient.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.820]   Flying is the safest way to travel.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.940]   Asking building engineers about elevator safety.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.260]   Elevators are protected by multiple tried and tested failsafe mechanisms.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.860]   They're nearly incapable of falling.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.420]   Asking software engineers about computerized voting.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.420]   That's terrifying.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.620]   Wait, really?
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.860]   Don't trust voting software and don't listen to anyone who tells you it's safe.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.860]   Why?
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.460]   I don't quite know how to put this, but our entire field is bad at what we do and if you
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.420]   rely on us, everyone will die.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.020]   They fixed it with something called blockchain.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.220]   Whatever they sold you don't touch it.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.020]   "Barry in the desert, wear gloves."
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.220]   Thank you, Randall Monroe.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.020]   It's all the earth.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.580]   Alright, that's enough of that.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:32.500]   We're going to talk about Apple's amazing record setting quarter.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   They weren't doomed?
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.460]   It turns out no.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.460]   Who knew?
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.460]   Oh man, I was already.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.460]   Who knew?
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.180]   I told my dad to sell that Apple stock.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.900]   It's only getting worse.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.340]   The good news is they get to whistle past that graveyard for another quarter or bastards.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.980]   But that ground, the ground is coming up so quickly.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.540]   I like Macworld's article.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.580]   Don't try to trick Tim Cook.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.020]   We'll find out what that's all about in just a second.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.020]   I showed it.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   I brought to you by Captera.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.980]   Captera.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.180]   We were just talking about how bad software can be.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.980]   There's nothing worse than old software, especially old software that requires you to
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.540]   run old, insecure systems.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.740]   But it's the fact that's why so many businesses are still using Windows XP or Internet Explorer
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:29.940]   8 because the kid Joey, who was the son of the nephew of the boss who wrote it in 2003,
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.940]   has long ago given up software and gotten into real estate and he can't update it.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.300]   It's the only software we can use in the business.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.580]   That's a bad thing.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.820]   That's why you need Captera.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.780]   Captera is modern up-to-date software for your business.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.620]   I mean it right now and Captera is the place to find it.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:54.780]   Over 700 categories, big categories like CRM software, video management software, that
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   kind of thing.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:03.180]   A little line of business things like yoga studio management or dog groomer management,
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:07.700]   project management software, network security software, it's all in there.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.580]   Captera makes it so easy to find exactly what you want.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.420]   You can select the category, select the business, identify the features you need, check the
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   boxes.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.460]   The filters are all designed to match the software you're looking at.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.860]   So you can say I only want four star ratings.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.180]   It runs on premises.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.820]   It serves 200 customers.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.860]   I can make appointments and oh yes, I can ask what dog breed.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.420]   I mean, it's that detail.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.860]   Do you check those boxes?
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:39.140]   It'll give you a if you want a comparison chart of all the software that fits the bill.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.940]   And by the way, there's so much software in here.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.180]   You're going to see no matter what you're looking for, dozens of programs that'll do
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.220]   it, then the best part begins.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.660]   Captera.com/Macbreak, run through this, then look at the reviews.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:59.180]   There are over more than a million current reviews from real users.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.700]   So this is so cool.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.660]   And I'll tell you why there's so many reviews.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:08.980]   So not positive, but valuable reviews is because it's free.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.300]   Now, Captera is free.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   You don't pay for it.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.260]   It costs you nothing.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.820]   And so I think a lot of users come back to Captera so grateful that they put a review
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.820]   up.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.180]   They say, hey, this didn't work.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.020]   This is going to be invaluable to you when you're choosing that software.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.460]   Validation of every review you can trust and you'll be more confident that you're getting
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.740]   the product that will work for you.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.420]   So don't pay Captera anything.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.060]   If you want to pay it forward, leave a review.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.500]   Captera is the leading free online resource for software solutions.

[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.820]   Captera software selection.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.540]   Simplified.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.540]   So what is it that they say?
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.460]   Give me the top line, Lori Gill.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.060]   Did Apple have a good quarter?
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.060]   Yeah, it did.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.060]   There you go.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.060]   A little bit.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.060]   A little bit.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.460]   Revenue $91.8 billion far ahead of the expectations.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.340]   The market thought they'd get $4.54 a share.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.700]   They got $4.99 a share.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:50.260]   They got product revenue of $79.1 billion, services up to $12.7 billion.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.940]   That's been a nice steady increase every quarter.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.580]   Overall income.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.820]   This is three months, kids.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.460]   $22.2 billion.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:04.060]   They're going to almost $8 billion a month.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.060]   Lots to learn from this.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:12.260]   In fact, I'm going to turn to Jason Snell and his great color charts.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.500]   I love those charts.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.620]   He does them every quarter.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.300]   First chart, very telling.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.620]   Quarterly revenue by category.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.100]   Big blue wedge, 61% wedge, iPhone.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.180]   That's changed a lot because remember it went down to almost 50/50 when the iPhone took
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.860]   a big hit and everything else was up and now they were knowing you iPads and except for
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.180]   the Mac Pro and the MacBook Pro, they were knowing you Macs.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.900]   The iPhone back on top baby.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.180]   This was to be expected.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.940]   This quarter is the holiday quarter where they announced new phones.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.340]   They sell a lot of them.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.340]   Not a surprise.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.860]   14% wearables, 11%.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.580]   Revenue, it's very spiky as you can see.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   We're in that peak quarter but still the highest revenue.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   Is it in Apple's history?
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.660]   I think it is.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.660]   Profit also, highest.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.420]   Pretty much product company history.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.820]   Have any company?
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.820]   Yes.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.820]   Revenue up 9%.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.820]   Any public trade company.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.820]   iPhone revenue up 56.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.780]   I mean to give you an idea, Google finally had to reveal.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:22.580]   So the rule with revealing income is if you would, if the CEO sees the line item, you're
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.140]   supposed to tell shareholders and Nari Page never cared about how many, how much, apparently
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.660]   never cared about how much any of the alphabet company's made.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.620]   So since he technically never saw it, he didn't have to disclose it.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.300]   But Sundar Pachay is the detailed person.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.620]   So for the first time, we learned revenue of the constituent parts of Alphabet and YouTube
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.220]   is 15 billion in AdSense.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.820]   Oh, wasn't that interesting?
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.820]   And that sounds like a lot.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.020]   But then you look at how much each of these Apple units is making per quarter.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.940]   No, YouTube is not-- when I saw that number, the first time I've ever seen a number out
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.140]   of YouTube, it was lower than I thought it would be.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.140]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.660]   It's still a lot of money.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.100]   I mean, I'll take it.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.100]   I'll take it.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.100]   Well, it's just a narrative.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.100]   It's like all these big success.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.300]   You know, the big cost for YouTube obviously is, I mean, there's lots of costs for YouTube.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.740]   I mean, it's server costs and people costs and everything else.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.740]   But it's a moral--
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.740]   Well, this is before.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.740]   You get a lot.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.740]   You're one grosser.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.060]   You're noticing is the margins as Apple moves to services.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.620]   The gross isn't very big yet, but the margins are like double what the hard--
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.620]   Well, look at the growths.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620]   It's a 30, yeah.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.620]   Look at the growth on wearables, home, and accessories.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.620]   But I think this is Apple Watch, right?
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   Apple Watch AirPods.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.620]   Oh, AirPods.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.620]   Let's not forget AirPods.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.300]   In fact, maybe it's mostly AirPods.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.980]   Apple does not break it down.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.620]   And Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro were still not-- Apple was not able to supply
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.380]   them to fit demand yet.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.780]   So this is with constrained demand on two popular products.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.580]   Year over year revenue changed 37% over last year.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.940]   Not too shabby.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.620]   Although last year it was 54% growth, 48% the year before.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.660]   Was that year before or quarter before?
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.660]   Year over year.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   Oh, year over year.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   Oh, yeah, but you're right.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.660]   It's quarter.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.660]   Okay.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.660]   So that's confusing because that was a release of the AirPods.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.900]   Last quarter was 54% year over year growth.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.900]   Last quarter.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.900]   That was very confusing.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.580]   Thank you for clarifying that.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.620]   As you said, Mac and iPad not impressive.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.460]   Look how linear that growth is for services.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.540]   Although didn't Luca Maestry say Apple TV+ revenue is immaterial?
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.300]   What does that mean?
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.300]   Immaterial, Laurie.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.460]   What does that mean?
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:36.620]   Well, they launched it in the middle of the quarter and it's free for almost everybody.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:43.420]   You know, so I think right now they're just not incorporating it in or it's just there's
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.300]   not enough data to be reflective of the actual numbers.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:54.220]   And I think it was Luca that was talking about how they're planning on sort of like spreading
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.780]   out revenue for it over the next year.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:04.580]   It's going to be sort of like divided out amongst devices, that device purchases because
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.660]   all of those people have actually, they get that first year for free.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.540]   So they're sort of taking a little bit from the actual device sale itself and moving it
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.380]   into the service.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.940]   But there's a lot of unknowns to account for.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:24.700]   So I don't think we're really going to see numbers that matter or that are really solid
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:32.500]   for a year from more than a year from its launch because of that initial freebie section
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.300]   of time.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.300]   What did they say though?
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   They said they owned that.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.020]   Fewer people took the freebie than they expected.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.540]   Ferrenstein did I think 10%.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.620]   I don't think Apple said it.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.460]   Oh, Tony, Tony Sakanagi.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.940]   Oh, okay.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.780]   So that was an analyst said that.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.260]   But that's so you have to take into consideration some of that stuff.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:58.740]   So what he might have been saying with that is 10% of device purchases, not necessarily
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.740]   10% of people who were qualified.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.740]   Right.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.780]   Because I bought three or four devices this year.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.540]   And I only took one subscription.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.540]   Exactly.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.540]   Exactly.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.780]   So that's something else that you have to consider is the family sharing thing.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.060]   The only one of the subscriptions can be used with the family sharing.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:18.180]   So that knocks down that sort of like device purchase spread out amongst the services
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.180]   thing.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.980]   And there's also a lot of, you know, other countries where either it's not available
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.940]   at all or it's available, but none of these shows are first language.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:35.300]   So 10% might well be 100% of US buyers per person.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.860]   That are qualified for it.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.860]   Right.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.860]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.580]   So service is nevertheless very nice roll up 17%.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.460]   Apple TV is in the services, right?
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.260]   It's TV plus is a service.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.260]   TV plus.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.260]   Plus.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.260]   The thing.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   Did they say how much they want to spend?
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.860]   Because they spent what a billion last year?
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.820]   Netflix spent 17 billion.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.140]   Is Apple going to up the ante?
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.860]   They didn't say in the meeting in that earnings call.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.540]   What they're going to spend.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   Nobody asked.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.900]   They're too busy asking 5G questions that they knew Tim would answer over and over again.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.900]   Like three times.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.780]   We have some color, some color on 5G.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.660]   Next week, one week from today, in fact, I should mention Mac break weekly, be a little
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.540]   bit late next week because we're going to do the Samsung event.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.300]   They're announcing their new Samsung Galaxy.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   Yes.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   I think 20.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.020]   I noted that all of the phones they're announcing are 5G.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.260]   And $1,000 and up.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.420]   And very expensive.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.060]   I don't want a 5G phone.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.260]   I can't get a 5G.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.260]   5G.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.260]   You can almost barely 5G.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.260]   You'll get sub six.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.260]   You'll be fine.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   I feel like LTE.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.260]   You'll be good.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.260]   I'm already in for 6G.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.260]   I'm just going to.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.260]   I'm down for 6G.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.100]   They're meeting about it now.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.100]   I know.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.100]   It's relentless.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   It's there.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.460]   It is a point because most people who are spending $1,000 on a phone, they're not buying
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.460]   it to replace it again next year.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.780]   So if you want to try to get $1,000 out of somebody, you better be able to tell them
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.780]   that no, this will not be useless in two or three years, even though it'll probably be
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.860]   four or five years.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.220]   If that's the motive, it's going to be so bad.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.940]   It's not the motive you want.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.740]   We're talking about salesmanship.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.380]   We're talking about actual technology.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.060]   And also, remember that isn't it great that in 2020, it is now going to be a good
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.060]   point.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.260]   You'll see the tick and the talk releases come in the same year.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:35.300]   We'll get the S20 and we'll get the iPhone 12, but then we'll get the iPhone 12 junior
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.100]   edition in three or four months after we bleed off the steam from everyone who's waiting
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.420]   to upgrade for the major one.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.420]   So we'll see done by user.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.420]   So we'll see.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.900]   Like you're also, it's going to be so confusing because you're going to have the phones that
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.300]   do 5G as in sub six and you have to figure out what your carrier supports and then the
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.380]   MM wave one and like the three or four markets that have that different phone and wire line
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.380]   to treat.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.500]   And you're going to walk by the tree and it won't work and people are going to be so
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   confused.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.540]   You're going to buy it, unlock, talk and know where it's going to work.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.540]   It's going to be wonderful for us.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.860]   I can boil this down.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.220]   It's going to be an LTE phone.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.220]   Just enjoy it.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.220]   Yes.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.940]   But the thing is I have to pay more for it.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.900]   I may even have to get a 5G subscription, which is more expensive.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.780]   I may get terrible battery life and I'm not getting anything better than I got.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.260]   But according to Verizon Super Bowl app, it will help you throttle over just the service
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.260]   services.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.900]   Can you now, so you picked up on that?
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.580]   See, I really was annoyed because Verizon got a lot of heat a couple of years ago because
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.140]   they throttled firefighters during the wild.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.900]   They're still trying to dig out of that.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.620]   And so all of the Verizon ads ever since have featured emergency personnel using Verizon
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:45.580]   phones without any mention of the real truth of the matter, which is you don't want to
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.380]   because they're going to throttle you.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.380]   They have no idea how to use 5G.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:58.020]   The other issue is will 5G be where most of the fires are and the chances are actually
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.940]   well in life.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:05.300]   So I was in the T-Mobile store and I thought, well, maybe I'll get myself a 5G phone.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.820]   This was maybe a month ago.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   They're selling.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.540]   The two of them, they have the one plus McLaren edition and they have Samsung.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.420]   I said, well, this is exciting T-Mobile.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.020]   I saw the map 5G lighting up everywhere.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.020]   Can I get it here?
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.020]   No.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.860]   I probably get it in San Francisco.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.820]   And again, like, where can I get it?
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:31.060]   He said, you can get it in Ucaya, which now, Alex and I know that's actually the, well,
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.220]   that's where the firefighting is going on.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.820]   You can get it in a tiny town in Northern California.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.020]   The problem is that you can get it in the town.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.020]   You can get it in the town.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:45.500]   But to go ahead and just a toxic point though, they emergency services, they will bring a
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.220]   truck out to create a point so they can connect to 5G or 4G or whatever they want.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.900]   Because the fire doesn't respect towers.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.980]   But I actually had a chance to use real 5G for a few days in Providence using a loaned
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.140]   phone and it really is a suboptable thing.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:08.340]   Not only just as you were saying, it's almost as though there are footprints painted on
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:13.620]   the sidewalk saying, stand right here and keep the phone away from your body and then
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.620]   you will get really good speeds.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.340]   But even when that does work, the battery suck is horrible.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.660]   You can actually feel the phone heating up in your hand.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.660]   And this wasn't during winter.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.700]   So that wasn't really a feature add.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.540]   It really is going to be, like Rene said, the first 5G phones I think for the first
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.380]   couple of years are going to stink and they're not going to be anywhere near worth the trade
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.380]   off for getting it.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:40.260]   We're getting a finely tuned LTE phone with chips that are designed to, that are really
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.900]   well optimized for power and heat dissipation.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:49.220]   I wouldn't worry about buying a 5G phone until two years from now, maybe even three years
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.220]   from now.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.140]   Which is good because Apple will not have a 5G phone this year, right?
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.140]   They should.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.140]   I think it's all about that.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.140]   They will.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.620]   Yeah, so they're working really hard with Qualcomm.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:04.260]   Like they're like a flat out sprint to try to get sub six 5G into a few markets for the
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.340]   September launch.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.060]   And then I still believe that MMwave is going to be YMAX.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.780]   It's not going to end up being a consumer technology.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.860]   It's just nowhere near useful for consumers, but to get an MMA because that's all that
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   Verizon and you want to talk about.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.460]   When you say six, you're talking about 600 megahertz, the frequency.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.540]   So, and my colleague Daniel Bader had the most beautiful way of explaining it because people
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.780]   think it's not real 5G.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:28.500]   But what it does is basically LTE is a myth for a large percentage of people in this world.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.700]   They never get anywhere near LTE speeds.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.980]   They just hear about people in cities talking about it.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.380]   But sub six has a lot of, it doesn't have the speed of millimeter wave, but it has much
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.380]   more range and much more reliability.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.580]   And what it means is that you can go through walls.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.460]   That's a good, that's a, but the millimeter wave is such a high frequency.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.380]   It bounces off spit.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.380]   It bounces.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.540]   But what it means is that people in rural and suburban areas who've never been able to
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.940]   get the full value out of LTE, they'll get the full value of LTE out of 5G.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.940]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.940]   Sub six.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.940]   It's confusing.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   Don't forget our survey.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.300]   We'd love to get your thoughts about how we're doing and what you'd like to see next.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   Quit.to/survey20.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.220]   Thanks in advance.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.460]   One graph at the very bottom of the page, I thought was interesting.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.940]   I'll let you guys tell me if it is.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.420]   Apple regional year over year growth.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:25.660]   Europe and China had been negative for a long time since more than a year ago.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.660]   Now both positive.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:31.100]   In fact, Europe is growing faster than the US now.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.980]   Is that, do you think that's, did they comment on that?
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.980]   Is that good news?
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   I think it's a good news.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.500]   I don't know, but I do think it has to do with the lower cost entry level phones.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.260]   The fact that they still carry the 10R and the iPhone 8 and now that they have the iPhone
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:50.060]   11 as the standard phone instead of a $1,000 phone.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:55.460]   These are all things that point toward kind of allowing more people into the ecosystem.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.620]   So I think, oh, and the Apple Watch Series 3, the price drop on that, I think these
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:06.980]   are all indicators of why it's growing out in these markets that have traditionally been
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   doing negative.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.900]   Well, and here's the graph that kind of confirms what you said, which is regional revenue.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.380]   America's through the roof and Europe and China, while it is going up a little bit, isn't
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.780]   going up nearly at that rate.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.580]   So yeah, they're selling more phones.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.900]   They're selling less expensive phones.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:22.900]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.140]   Although growth in China right now under the current conditions, even a small amount of
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.260]   growth is impressive, especially since again a year ago, exactly one year ago, Tim Cook
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.020]   wrote that famous letter saying that China has tanked and we're going to have to take
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.540]   a hit the second time in the company history.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.540]   So what changed?
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.940]   You think is it Laurie's thesis that it's the less expensive phones?
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.420]   I think it's a variety of fact.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.060]   I think for as much as people keep saying Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs, we've learned that
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.220]   the inverse is true as well.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:55.100]   And he has been balancing trade sanctions and the personalities involved and the currency
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:00.780]   fluctuations and just the general feelings in China with pricing and a whole bunch of
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   other things to stimulate that market again.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:08.540]   I think it's worked better than I expect than I think than most people expected.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:14.100]   For people who criticized Cook for his kind of political stance with the president and
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.460]   in China, well, that's what you get though, when you play the game.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   Shareholder value.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460]   Shareholder value.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.460]   Go ahead Andy.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:28.500]   No, I was going to say is that we're learning, Apple's learning that in many parts of the
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:34.820]   world price sensitivity really is king that Apple is seen as a luxury brand and you can
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.860]   respect Ferrari, you can respect the Lamborghini, but you never for a moment consider actually
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.100]   being able to buy a Lamborghini.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:48.940]   And especially in a country like China where Android has for a lot of different factors
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:55.260]   has become kind of like the de facto operating system and the iPhone is the luxury brand.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.860]   You're forced to compete with really, really good phones that the equivalent of the United
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.500]   States would cost only four or $500.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.980]   And like Lori said, it is amazing.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:10.420]   It's one of the best moves I think Apple has made tactically in a long time to keep the
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:15.020]   older models in the lineup and figure out a way to sell them at a competitive rate because
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:20.900]   still a two or three year old iPhone is still as good as a lot of mid range Android phones
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.500]   that are out there.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.420]   And even India, India did way better than I think anybody was expecting.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.100]   They were calling it a boom.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.340]   Thanks to 10 R sales and 11 sales.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.980]   And I was also getting a lot of help from the government there.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.140]   They had a lot of bridges to mend with the Indian government, but now that they're trying
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:40.580]   to bring more manufacturing in India, trying to bring more jobs from Apple into India,
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.060]   they're getting a lot of help on both ends.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.540]   I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple go both directions to where we see something where
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.540]   we see a cheaper phone and then we also see them continue to have a top end phone that
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.860]   keeps going up because everybody on this panel will spend any amount of money.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.220]   There's a lot to get the latest.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:00.620]   You know, I was at the vlog university over the weekend.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   It was great.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.620]   Justine looks fantastic.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   She's so good.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.260]   I bet she uses the latest iPhone 10.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   A lot of them do.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:13.420]   Like what I was pro max, what I noticed down there was that I almost didn't see.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.660]   I mean, among those that group, there was almost nobody that had an Android phone.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.260]   I mean, it was almost everybody had iPhones.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.820]   And so it was just you're doing video.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.420]   It was for video bloggers.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.500]   If you're doing video, there's really no choice.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.660]   You're going to get an iPhone.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.420]   And so it was and there's just the app.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.460]   The app selection is better.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.460]   There's a lot of other things.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.380]   And so they'll make pro or whatever.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:42.540]   So Steve Martin and Mark Spencer, who's on the Mac break studio, they took that new
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.860]   filmic app that will take.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.620]   And they put you like this.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:50.500]   They put two of them at 90 degree angles with four directions.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.500]   Oh boy.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.500]   So they could do a round table discussion.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.700]   Oh, let's what we should do.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   Round table discussion.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.540]   They brought it all in to multicam in Final Cut and just edited it as a multicam and
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.540]   switched it through.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.540]   I thought Leo needs to see that.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.540]   Oh.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.140]   Like it totally worked.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.660]   And they had it all synced up and it was the first time I'd ever seen it.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.660]   Anyway, it's so.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.700]   I never thought this million dollar studio would get obsolete quite so far.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.180]   Jim and Apple.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:20.660]   But I think there's some of us that would just keep buying whatever the best thing that
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.140]   Apple has to do it.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.020]   And if it went up to $2,000, maybe we don't go in every year.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.020]   I'm guessing that's a fair share of that.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:31.380]   But I think that if you make sure that you continue to serve that the more cost sensitive.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   You do both.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.820]   You go down to four, 500 or $300.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.500]   I would love to get my kids, for instance, the less expensive ones.
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.900]   And I think they're timing now.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.100]   They're going to do sprint, right?
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.980]   This looks like the next SE will be this spring.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.060]   You kind of split it in half.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:51.060]   So you can if what you'd love to do is have those spikes kind of stay there all year long,
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.060]   right?
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:57.460]   The people the people who cannot wait to have the next hottest top of the line iPhone will
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.500]   always have the chance to get it in October.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.540]   They have to give people a few months to say, no, I can't possibly wait a few months.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.820]   I know that the mid range phone is going to be good for my needs and I'll say $300.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.740]   But yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.300]   It's a tactic worthy of a Romulan.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:17.660]   You know, we left out the number one top line number, 150 billion pockets.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.660]   Y'all.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.660]   150 billion.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.660]   Was it 150?
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.660]   150 billion.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.500]   And that doesn't put it.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.500]   Not including your.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.220]   You have Apple devices, Macs, iPads and phones.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.420]   But 90% have to be phones, right?
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.340]   150 or is it 1.5 billion?
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.580]   It's it's it's not quite close to it's close to 100 billion, but iPhone by itself is not
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.340]   closed across 100 billion yet.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.700]   100 million or 100 billion.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.700]   150 billion.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.700]   Billion.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.700]   Billion.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   Wow.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.700]   There's there's what 8 billion people.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.700]   Oh, sorry.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.700]   Oh, now I'm getting this.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.700]   No, it's 1.5 billion.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.700]   That's what I thought.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.700]   Almost 1 billion.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:55.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.700]   Couldn't be 150 billion.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.100]   Thank you again, Alex, for correcting me.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.900]   See, this is what happens when I actually read the article.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.900]   It's a good video.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.260]   No, it's just then your head you think there's 8 billion people in the world.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.260]   They couldn't possibly.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.100]   Yes, of course, it's 1.5 billion.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.820]   Plus 98% customer satisfaction on iPhones.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.820]   That's pretty good.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.820]   Good numbers.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.820]   Let's just say room for improvement.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.860]   Let's not let them get a.
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:22.580]   We get impressed by having apps have a 1.5 billion, but man, the difference between having
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.420]   app have 1.5 billion installs and have 1.5 billion people using your hardware.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.420]   Every single one.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.500]   That's an amazing number and a huge success.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.700]   And I can't think I don't think there's any app device anything.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.340]   I mean, there's there's Facebook.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.580]   I don't what's app isn't it?
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.580]   One and a half billion.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.580]   Maybe it is.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.580]   Well, TikTok is at 1.65.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.580]   Is it really?
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.580]   Wow.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.580]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.580]   But I think I think Facebook is at 2.6 billion.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.580]   For hardware, you're right.
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.580]   That's saying a lot.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.580]   It's monthly active users.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.500]   I think broke 3 billion in there.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   But it's nevertheless.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.700]   It's a lot.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.700]   It's good.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   If you're selling that.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   But hardware is just much different than software.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.860]   I mean, it's just a little bit more margin too.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.060]   Jason Snell, Apple's record quarter.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.380]   Don't try to trick Tim Cook.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.220]   You told us that would happen, Lori Gill.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   You said, oh, I can't.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.220]   They always do.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.300]   It's my favorite part.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.180]   So what do they what do they try to get Tim to admit to this time?
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.780]   Well, let's see.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.780]   I've got the transcripts.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.540]   You're trying to get them to the 5G stuff, right?
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.700]   That was the they're trying to dig the 5G.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.500]   Yeah, all of the ones that were well, there was two that like were sort of specifically
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.980]   sort of hinting at 5G and what Apple's planning to do.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:41.660]   And one of them was this sort of general forecasting outside of the range that they
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.780]   usually give.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.980]   But yeah, they were I'm trying to find.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.380]   They asked him about AR or self-driving vehicles.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.900]   Nothing about self-driving vehicles.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:48:02.780]   There was somebody did comment on on AR and Tim Cook did kind of basically sort of reiterated
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.860]   what he had been quoted as saying, which is that he's very excited about AR.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.780]   So that that all kind of made sense.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.420]   I'm still very excited.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.060]   Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.060]   You should see what I'm saying.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.340]   He was excited because he believed that AR has applications in both business and commercial
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.940]   and he likes when technologies are that have that broad an impact makes him much more efficient
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.940]   to deliver.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.260]   Yeah, it's a bigger market.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.260]   Let's see.
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:37.900]   I was just reading Jason's trick dust thing.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.900]   This is just his analysis of the graphs that we just.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.900]   Oh, yeah, I think down toward the bottom, he actually there is.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   There it is.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.260]   Yeah, Tim Cook sounded a little under the weather on Tuesday.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.500]   He spoke and you could tell Jason's a podcaster.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.740]   He spoke to a dude tone, cleared his throat, sniffled and sounded like he was speaking
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:01.540]   around some sort of lozenge or perhaps it was a cough drop.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:07.300]   Maybe a fisherman's friend and even and even when ill Tim Cook is a wily fellow who can't
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:13.260]   be tricked into disclosing future Apple product directions, even by wily financial analysts
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.020]   and you're right 5G Katie Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.820]   Tim, at some point in the future, will Apple launch a 5G phone?
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.660]   How big of a demand is there for 5G?
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.060]   Actually she didn't even ask.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:31.140]   She actually said at some point in the future Apple will launch a 5G phone.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:36.500]   So because of that knowledge that you haven't given to us, give us some ideas on how that's
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.500]   going to work.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.500]   It's going to do.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.660]   She was totally trying to like, you know, like, oh, well, I'm not asking him.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.300]   I'm just stating facts about the future is great.
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.980]   I'm asking you about the overall market for 5G phones.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.980]   I was like three.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.540]   Was that two questions or three?
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.140]   See, I think he should have just said, well, that's assuming that the 5G is going to be
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.500]   the prevailing standard.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.980]   And then just walk away from that.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.420]   Oh, what else could it be?
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.340]   That would be good for a year of rumors.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:12.540]   Based on the, this is a sumit, Chatterjee of JP Morgan, based on the velocity of momentum
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.100]   you're seeing for the products exiting the quarter.
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:20.820]   How comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues throughout the year?
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.260]   You know, says Tim, we have a practice of forecasting the current quarter.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.940]   And so we've given you the range we expect.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.980]   We're not going to say anything beyond that.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.620]   It was a big range for next quarter though, because of coronavirus and the uncertainty
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.860]   around what impact they're going to have.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.860]   They say they're going the biggest guidance ever.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.060]   They're going back to work in a week.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.740]   Apple's factories are going to go back to work in a week.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.100]   They took it a couple extra weeks off after the lunar year, right?
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.340]   The stores are all closed.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.500]   They closed the stores.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.500]   Right.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:55.660]   He gave a pretty in depth answer, answer that question, especially when they're talking
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:51:01.580]   about surprise supplies for Ram, I think, and asking for a special supply chain.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.380]   We do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.020]   All these suppliers are ultimate sources.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.300]   They're obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expectant on and on and on.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:14.540]   Because this is probably the biggest variable of all the topics he had to cover during this
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.540]   thing.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.700]   There's a lot we just don't know, including just how easy it's going to be to get people
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.020]   to go to work or to get people to go from wherever they are.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:28.500]   Anyway, it's a big, big variable, which is probably why this is probably the longest substantive
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.460]   answer that he gave during the entire Q&A.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.900]   And they're also deep cleaning the stores frequently.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.900]   And checking temperatures.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.540]   Predue start for 80 hours.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:48.980]   The issue with the checking the temperature thing is that I think it takes up to 14 days
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.860]   before anyone even shows symptoms.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   That's the problem.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.180]   So that's great that they do it, but that's also like that's part of the problem with
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.980]   the spread of this particular virus is that it doesn't show the symptoms quite as fast.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.260]   And I think that the issue is that you can spread it without showing symptoms, which
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:08.300]   is what really and then the mortality rate is 10 times the normal flu.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.900]   So that's the, to what, to tightening everybody up.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:17.260]   No, I think the mortality rate is actually, it's like 3% or 4% I think.
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.260]   No, I don't know.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.260]   CDC is 0.001.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.260]   Okay.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.260]   Okay.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.260]   Mortality.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:28.980]   So it's, it's, I don't know, it was again, me listening to news in the morning while I
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:33.740]   was getting, making breakfast, but I think it was something like a, yeah, much higher
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.740]   mortality rate.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.740]   That's what they're worried about.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.180]   And just having another one that they have to manage like they're like, we can kill it
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.460]   off right now, or we have to deal with this every season.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.020]   And so they're, they're trying to kill it off.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:50.180]   Anyway, so all China shutting down though.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.620]   My son's in Asia right now in vacation.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.540]   Oh, where?
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.260]   He's moving around.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.660]   I think he was in Bali.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.860]   He went, it was in Vietnam.
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.380]   But he has some Vietnamese coffee.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.380]   Huh?
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.660]   I hope he had some Vietnamese coffee.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.460]   I'm sure he did.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.460]   Are you kidding me?
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.460]   Oh gosh.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.900]   But his, someone's his brother and I are saying, I, I, our apple messaging him instructions.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.900]   Wash your hands.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.780]   Doesn't, the mask is important.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.780]   It's washed the surfaces.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.780]   Don't touch your face.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.860]   No, it's so fun.
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.140]   I was in, I was in, when I was in Vietnam at an ad agency and they, they served me coffee
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.140]   and they were like, yeah, it's coffee.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.140]   You're in Vietnam.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.140]   It's like, it's like, it's coffee.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.300]   It's coffee or, you know, just coffee.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.500]   Yeah, we don't call it Vietnamese coffee.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.900]   Yeah, that tomato soup and that girl, she sandwich, that's American food.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:46.620]   Um, yes, as we always remind everybody, the flu is a much bigger threat, at least to date.
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   Get your shot.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.620]   Yes.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:53.020]   Um, actually I'm not doctors.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.020]   Not not the investor.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.020]   My say, yeah.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.740]   Well, I see that, that, that also reminded me of something, something about what we're
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.740]   talking about having faith in our election systems.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.780]   We, the difficulty when the rumors on the fear gets way out of hand, we can't even convince
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:13.980]   people anymore that a measles shot, a measles vaccination is a really good idea.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:19.740]   And so we've gone from having this, I think it was designated as eradicated just 10, 15
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.740]   years ago to now it is, of course, increasing in numbers.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:29.020]   Imagine how difficult it is to get people to not believe politically and culturally
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.540]   motivated bad information about election systems.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.820]   And now you're talking about the difficulties we have and having any sort of positive change
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.300]   in the world.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:41.700]   So what I found out is you tell them that five G, because everyone's scared of 5G, right?
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:45.580]   Because like nobody likes science no matter which way it goes, that 5G is caused by carbon
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.020]   and only to protect yourself is with inoculations.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.020]   Then we saw all the way up.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.980]   Just to put this in perspective, the R0 of coronaviruses believe to be somewhere between
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.020]   one and a half and two and a half.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.220]   That's the number of people you're inspected to.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.380]   In fact, if you have it, one to two people.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.020]   For measles, it's 12 to 18.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:10.380]   And the amount of people you need inoculated around you as a shield, you know, in that
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.380]   zone.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.380]   Get your shots.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:16.380]   Yeah, just saying nothing about, just saying nothing about immunity compromised people
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.900]   that you might be exposed to.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.940]   I don't have much fear about getting a terrible flu myself.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.580]   My terrible fear is that I myself will have a couple of days where I'm a little bit tired
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.860]   but I don't know why and I don't know why I have the flu.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:35.660]   But I visited some people or happened to be exchanging handshakes or somebody who is
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.060]   immunity comprised and they're going to have a really, really bad couple of months or they're
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.700]   going to have a hospitalization.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:47.940]   That's why we don't get shots to protect ourselves individually.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.860]   We get shots to protect ourselves collectively and a lot of people forget that.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.900]   Fun story, hi mom.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.660]   In my high school, there was a compromised batch of measles vaccine and kids started getting
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.660]   measles.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.220]   And the doctors at first could not diagnose it until one old German doctor came in and
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.220]   goes, that's measles.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.220]   What's the matter with you people?
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.220]   Don't you recognize it?
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.860]   No, no, no, I've seen that in a while.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.420]   Things just shut down.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.300]   Those are for people who intended to be vaccinated.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.820]   So yeah, you can't fool around with that stuff.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.580]   That's just like a Star Trek episode.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.580]   Fascinating.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:26.340]   The computer science of disease that was eradicated 300 years ago and then they sold it all in
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.500]   the last act of the whole story.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.500]   I just read something.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.500]   It was on Reddit.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:33.620]   So maybe you remember this, Carsten.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:39.740]   Measles was introduced from the bovine population, the human population in the, I think the
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:46.100]   16th century, but it's another animal virus that got communicated over to humans.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:50.980]   CGP Grey is a great video on that about, you know, as we started agriculture and penning
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.540]   animals in the same cities as us, just all the diseases that started to keep the animals
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.540]   away.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.140]   I see that was the number one tip I gave my son.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.180]   Don't go in any live animal markets.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.180]   Stay away.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.180]   Quen is pal pro.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.180]   Don't name the livestock.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.620]   Don't get to know your livestock.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.100]   Something else about the quarterly results, I think we've covered them pretty thoroughly
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.620]   all the way down to the viruses.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.420]   All the way down to the coronavirus.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.900]   It was a good quarter.
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.140]   They just seem unstoppable.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.540]   Yeah, I mean, it's, and I say that not as a financial analyst, but just as somebody who
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:28.060]   reads these reports, but it's like you're even, I like, I think it's healthy to be cynical
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:33.900]   a little bit more than a little bit, particularly when it's such a good piece of PR.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:39.980]   But I, boy, after F, I was reading that transcript over and over again last week and getting
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.740]   in touch with people who know a lot more about these things than I do to make sure that,
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:44.740]   well, that sounds weird.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:45.740]   No, it isn't weird.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.740]   Okay.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:52.580]   There just is not anything in this report that is not either a good news or b, indication
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:56.180]   that whatever their plans are, it's working very, very well.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.980]   So that's, that's pretty exceptional.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:02.460]   I actually think that the one of the things that risk factors for Apple is less of that
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:07.220]   something going wrong for them, particularly in more of more issues happening with Android.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:10.620]   So if you look at Huawei talking about moving away from Android, Samsung has threatened
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.220]   to do that for a while.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.580]   If Apple gets a majority stake, it puts them in an entirely different legal position of
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.180]   what they're doing right now.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:22.260]   Sitting in a minority stake, which they seem to be safe in right now, I think is, is good
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.380]   for them because there are a lot of things that I can't, you don't want to be on the
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.380]   off.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.500]   You don't want to, what you're never going to do is start having a majority stake.
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.500]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.740]   They're never, they're never going to have a majority stake because they can't cater
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.420]   to everybody and they don't, they can't cater to every price.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.140]   They can't cater to every usage and they can't give the-
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:39.540]   Is it a majority 51% or is it 90%?
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:43.780]   No, just that people will have a much, much deeper conversation when it gets to 51.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.500]   You know, and it's, and the problem is you take out Huawei and Samsung out of the Android
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:53.260]   environment, if that happened, and you end up in, you know, Android in different position.
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:57.780]   Bill Gates showed up on the big screen with Steve Jobs in front of him saying we're going
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.540]   to give you $150 million Apple.
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.540]   We know why you brought out a business.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.540]   There's rumors that we're launching.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:05.340]   It's probably unfeasible for the, even if they, even if they jerk around with the operating
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:09.140]   system and make their own custom Android, it's too hard for them to leave Google Play,
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.300]   especially outside of China.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.900]   Windows phone and Palm have shown us what happens when you don't have a thriving app
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.820]   economy and nobody wants, nobody wants any part of that.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.140]   Blackberries, last phones are coming off these.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.220]   Oh, God, I was so sad for Canada, Leo.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.700]   We lost, we lost Nortel.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.700]   We lost Maytrox.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:27.900]   I had a Corel is like a footnote now and they've taken our Blackberry.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:31.580]   So TCL is announced they're not going to make any more Blackberry phones, but is there, could
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.420]   somebody else make them?
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:37.980]   Blackberry could light, Blackberry had licensed the manufacturer of handsets to TCL and they
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.900]   could do, could license it to somebody else, but I don't think there's a huge lineup of
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:42.900]   OEMs.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.460]   I mean, HT, who knows what HTC will ever do, but I don't think there's a huge lineup of
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.060]   OEMs eating a path at their door.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:52.220]   Yeah, especially if TCL has said, yeah, it's not worth it.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.380]   Blackberry is going to become like Polaroid and Kodak.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.940]   It's going to, some company is going to buy the trademark and then use, just put it on
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.340]   really, really super cheap.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.340]   Blackberry's not dying.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.420]   They're just not in the phone business.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.940]   They own Q and X, which is not a bad property to own.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.620]   But Nortel's still around Leo, but how often do you, it does come up in every conversation?
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.380]   It's like, what happens is they niche down and they become a patent holding entity.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.220]   And it's just, it's sad because there's not, there were not that many countries that
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.740]   were making vibrant phone hardware and operating systems.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.620]   It was the last phone I owned before the iPhone came out in 2007.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.620]   That was the problem.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.620]   That was the last one.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.620]   Everybody.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.620]   Bye bye.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.620]   Never owned another one.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:34.060]   In fact, Lisa, when we first got together, it probably about 2010, 2011, something like
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.740]   that was used, was rocking a Blackberry storm.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.740]   Remember how awful that was?
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.460]   That was the one we actually put a screen to click.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.740]   It won the Blackberry Award for Innovation of the Year, Leo.
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.740]   How can you say that?
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.580]   I convinced her that maybe she should get an iPhone and I don't see it.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:51.380]   I actually shot a short for the storm and, and using it mate, I was like, oh, I just
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.380]   got to finish this.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.380]   I just got to get this done.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.380]   I just got to get this done.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:00.180]   So the moment, the moment when I knew that Blackberry was doomed was when I was called
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.220]   in for another briefing, routine stuff, I thought, okay, so I'll get to talk to some
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.980]   engineers and they might show me something one or two.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:12.540]   And they just took a case after showing me the next two years worth of like, of hardware
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.820]   samples of things they were planning to do.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:20.140]   And I thought, you don't even under NDA, you don't tell a person, you don't tell a member
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.940]   of the, you don't announce what you're going to do for the next two years unless you are
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.740]   absolutely convinced nobody thinks you have a future.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:31.140]   And you're, because you're not going to know two years from now what product you need to
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.140]   put into the market.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.500]   And they stopped making phones.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.180]   The only thing that was making the money, they stopped making phones for an entire year
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.940]   to make the playbook, which then they did not sell.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   Yes.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:40.940]   Oh God, the playbook.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.940]   It's so sad.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   That was a nightmare.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:52.260]   Josh Nadeau writing for Fast Company, Apple has a Vladimir Putin problem.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.820]   What he's talking about is the law that Russia will put into effect this summer.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.500]   It's being colloquially known as the law against Apple.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:09.100]   It will require all smartphone device devices to preload applications that are Russian in
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.100]   origin.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:17.580]   Now, of course, Apple traditionally prevents device carriers from putting anything on there,
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.660]   Verizon, anybody can't put anything on there.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.900]   So that's an aesthetic issue.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:29.260]   There's also the security issue and privacy issue that Russian devices may have spyware
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.980]   put on them by the Russian government.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.620]   We don't know.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.780]   Nadeau's contention is that Apple's going to have to kind of cross this Rubicon July
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:45.300]   2020 either quit the country or go along with the Russian law.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   What do you think Apple will do?
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.300]   I think they have to quit.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   They have to quit.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:57.820]   They can't possibly acquiesce or else they're basically saying this is our plan for every
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.740]   single country that wants to do anything to our phones before they reach the hands of
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.300]   our customers.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   They can't do it.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:09.500]   So the simple idea that we've talked about this so many times before, they have to put
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.820]   up or shut up on privacy and security.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.860]   If they're going to say that we're going to allow a state to put software on our phones
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:23.140]   that in our view might compromise the privacy of the data that's on that phone, they should
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.420]   also put up another big banner on the side of a building saying that this is all just
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.300]   PR and it means nothing to us.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.060]   So they have no alternative.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.380]   Well, maybe.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:38.140]   The question is, are some of the privacy things that we're seeing where we're constantly being
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:44.420]   told we're sharing our steps towards the idea that the OS really gets into a position where
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.900]   it doesn't trust the apps that are sitting on top of it.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.020]   So yeah, you can pre-install them, but the user can uninstall them.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.540]   And in addition to that, the OS is never going to trust the app.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.180]   You know, like, you know, or never going to trust an app that doesn't go through some
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.180]   sort of creation.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.740]   That might be a technological solution is to sandbox the Russian apps.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740]   Right.
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.860]   Well, sandbox apps that aren't in some kind of Apple trusted network, you know, there
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.380]   has to be something and the Russians don't fit inside that.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.500]   So you're following the law, but not.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.340]   And I think that what you would say is like, if you can't, if you're not certain that you
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.540]   can get that done, you cut them off, but there's no reason for them to say anything
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.540]   now, right?
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.260]   But, but you know, they're going to have, but what if you have a situation where you release
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.740]   it in Russia where, you know, and it wouldn't be perfect at first, but you get into a way
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.940]   and then you're in a cat and mouse issue with the Russian government.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:34.340]   Is a precedent Apple removed or changed the way it showed the Crimean peninsula in the
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:41.220]   Apple maps in response to a Russian law, which said, you know, you can't show Crimea, which
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.220]   Google did as well.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.220]   That was a non controversy.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.220]   Really?
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.060]   In my view, there were some crannies that were.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.220]   It's too happy about it.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.860]   It was like showing Taiwan as a Chinese.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.860]   What's they do?
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:55.860]   Protect.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:00.660]   Yeah, see that I think that there's a difference between even when you talk to met, we actually
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.020]   we talked to actually cart actual cartographers about it.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:08.180]   Even they have debates over when do we say that a border has changed or a border has
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:14.100]   moved and it's not necessarily because of pressure of a of the country that did the
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.100]   land grab.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:20.220]   You really have to say when people are essentially when people say you have to make sure that
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.020]   the map reflects what the world thinks the border is.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020]   And you also have to.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.300]   They're only doing it in Russia.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:33.540]   If you look at the Russian world, yeah, if you do get Crimea or the Russian world, if
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:38.660]   you do look at it like, which includes, I gather Ukraine, if you look at Crimea here,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.100]   it's not part of the Russian Federation.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.100]   It's part of Ukraine.
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.580]   If you look at it in Russia, it's part of the Russian Federation.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:48.980]   So that is that is cowtowing to a government to change the map just for that government,
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:53.660]   much as they don't show the Taiwanese flag in Hong Kong or mainland China.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:59.300]   And they don't put lots of air lines on don't say that they're going to you know, they get
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.300]   yeah, so here's what I think I think Apple's going to go given.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.780]   They're going to say we have to adhere to the laws of the countries we're in.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:10.820]   If they do what you say, and if they leave Russia, then the next country is India.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.820]   The next country after that is China.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:13.820]   Well, China is only dangerous.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.900]   The next country after that is the United States.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:22.180]   The next couple of them rise in T-Mobile say, hey, what about us?
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.340]   But I think that what a clear.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.340]   It's a couple of precedent.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.340]   Sorry.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.340]   Go ahead.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:27.340]   Renee.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.420]   So there's a couple of precedents here because Apple famously or infamously doesn't have FaceTime
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.620]   in some Middle Eastern countries where it's not allowed to have the FaceTime app.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620]   And I know we're moving out.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620]   That's cultural sensitivity.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.820]   They're adding yet no, totally, but it is changing the operating system due to, you
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.500]   know, to the different borders.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:45.780]   The thing that's interesting here is when you look at it from outside, if we lived in
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.540]   an idyllic Star Trek world.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:51.620]   There is an objective case to be made that some countries are as comfortable with America
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.820]   controlling the software on their citizens' phones as America has been with Huawei controlling
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:56.820]   the software.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:57.820]   I understand that.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.940]   But we don't live in that world.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.340]   So there's a couple of possibilities.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.820]   One is leaving Russia because it's not a huge impact.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.260]   But when you hit China, it becomes untenable.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.420]   The other is you make it not your problem.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:13.640]   And that is Russia can make a law that the carrier or the vendor before they hand over
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.280]   the phone to you has to plug it into some sort of enterprise management thing or just
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.900]   some sort of app dispersal thing and preload.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:24.760]   You know, instead of I message, it's you message or whatever, whatever alternative they want
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   is.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.640]   And then to Alex's point, the operating system can pop up if it has a problem.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.360]   People can delete them if they have a problem and it satisfies the letter of the law, if
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.960]   not the spirit of the law, but also makes everybody safe.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.600]   Yeah, some sort of technological middle ground, which could be sprint.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.480]   Well, I've talked about for a long time and what we're seeing is the this there is a more
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.880]   adversarial relationship.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.360]   I've noticed since the last OS update where my my OS is constantly telling me what all
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.800]   the apps are doing.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.120]   So there's this adversarial relationship already built up between the apps and the thing, which
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.760]   is obviously what a lot of developers are complaining about.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.440]   You know, they say we can't run our business if we can't be installed on those things.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.000]   The tile CEO said apples, kind of inhibiting our ability to make money and in favor of
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.600]   their fine my iPhone.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.160]   But what they're really doing is protecting.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   I mean, I don't think Apple's doing the protecting the user.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.720]   They're protecting the user from from this constant, you know, like for me, a lot of
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.120]   times with something like messenger, it's always said on you can track me when I'm there.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.560]   The only time I ever turn it on track all the time is when I'm sharing my my location
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.240]   with someone that doesn't have a I think it's much more likely we're going to see some
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.440]   sort of middle ground like that.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.920]   Then Apple says goodbye Russia because I think they would at least try it.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   They can't say yes.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920]   Okay, fine.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.920]   Go ahead.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920]   That's a precedent.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920]   They don't want to say they can't leave Russia.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920]   That's a precedent.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   They don't want to set this got to be.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.720]   But they've had time to work on this, you know, and again, I don't know if it'll be
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.520]   perfect when they started, but I bet you, you know, over a couple of years they can
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   get pretty good at this.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.600]   You said this all along, Andy, that there is at some point a line beyond which they can't
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   go.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.880]   And I think you just kind of close in advance of this will walk right up to us.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.440]   But Russia's not requesting is being able to hack the phone being able to open the phone
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.440]   yet.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.640]   I mean, I'm not like, no, it's not a request that right.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.440]   And I think that is I think that is the line.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.840]   And that's and honestly, that's the main reason we're talking about this is because we know
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.560]   that the US, the five highs, Russia, China, everybody wants Apple to break the encryption
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560]   on the phone.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.560]   Right.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.080]   The keyword being yet.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:30.480]   I think it's really optimistic that Apple will try to find a way to comply with the letter
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.360]   of the law, but not give the Russian government what they want.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.080]   The Russian government will say, no, that's not what we mean.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.080]   Congratulations.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.440]   You just earned yourself a hardware sales ban within our country until you actually toe
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   the line.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:49.640]   I just think that Apple has to I'm sure they have internally, but this is a this is a fight
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.200]   they're going to have to fight on every single border all across the world.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:00.000]   And it's okay for them to say that it's okay for them for them to say that we have a variable
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.040]   stance on privacy.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.800]   So long as it doesn't over much interfere with our ability to do business within a territory,
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.960]   we think that it's important thing, but it is something that we are willing to put on
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.520]   the table if it means staying inside a certain market.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.880]   That's a that's a justifiable point to make.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.760]   I disagree with it, but it's a justifiable point to make.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.280]   But if they think that they can continue to do business with these with these countries
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.640]   and continue to just give and give and give and that that doesn't teach these governments
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.200]   that whatever we ask Apple will cave in, it's a fool's errand.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.880]   I think that they have to make sure that I'm sure that it's somewhere there's some ledger
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.680]   that says that here's what will happen at the time at which Turkey or Russia or any other
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:47.920]   country says that we you have to have a battery killing feature that allows us to instantly
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:55.080]   turn on any subgroup of users for live 24/7 tracking at any moment without in without informing
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080]   that user.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.880]   Are you going to do that or you're going to simply say that, okay, we can't do that.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   Congratulations.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   We just lost China.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   We just lost this entire country.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.640]   And the reality is is that Russia is a small enough market that that Apple could afford
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   to lose them.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.840]   I mean, they could afford to let go of that money.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.840]   You know, it's not that's the amount of money.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.400]   Amor, I believe it's three billion dollars, which is the amount that they were they were
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.640]   accidentally over their projections, you know, this quarter.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.680]   So it's not a big it's not really I mean, it's a billions of dollars, but it's not you
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   don't think it's massive.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.360]   You're aggressive and more problem because then if they don't walk from China, which
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.840]   they can't, then Apple then we then the criticism is well, but the other thing is it's a communication
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.760]   to China that that app.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.080]   So the problem on China side is if Apple says we're going to walk, you know, if China
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.960]   starts rumbling, then you know, Apple's already started figuring out where else to build iPhones.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.280]   And you know, that's that starts to become a, you know, that becomes a much more complicated
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.280]   thing.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   It's a consequence.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.280]   There's a Chinese government may not want to.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.280]   There's a relationship there.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   You know, and I think that that's not that's a much more complicated relationship than Russia.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.680]   How many Russians use iPhones?
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.680]   Would it be a political consequence?
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.840]   It'd be a good gray market.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.240]   If it happens.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240]   I was talking the other day.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.440]   I remember we used to get in line and get iPhones some years ago and there'd be a lot
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   of people online who weren't buying them for themselves were buying as many as they could
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.280]   to send to China when it was when it's still a big market for black market iPhone.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.320]   When this was when when it got started, you know, I didn't do it, but I was when I was
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.560]   going to Africa, all my friends in Africa said, you know, we'll pay two X.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560]   You know, if you just bring them down because it was a it was a real.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.760]   They don't leave eyes too while you're at it.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.760]   They didn't get a little leaves.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   But they did care a lot about the.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.960]   The vice used to be big in the Soviet Union in the.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.360]   You didn't buy two big tapes.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.160]   In Africa, the big thing was anything with a logo on it.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.840]   American logo was a big deal.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.200]   So I would, you know, come down with a bunch of shirts and I trade them first at you like
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200]   sculptures.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.160]   Some Kamala Harris 2020 shirts.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.840]   You can just bring those like like all kinds.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.840]   I had all these concert t-shirts.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.080]   You can get a lot of old ones.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.400]   I had all these concert t-shirts and I wanted to win the Super Bowl.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   That was a that's a good.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   You know what they make?
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.320]   Those they make the shirts and hats and that's what happens to them.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.720]   They ain't up in Africa.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.320]   I'm like some of my some of my best pictures from from my trip to Beijing was going to the
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.840]   counterfeit market and seeing that.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.680]   I think there's just before they could sell they could actually sell the iPhone in China.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.840]   Could be wrong.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.160]   But you even saw like case after case the Apple logo on everything like there was a it was
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.240]   a really bad not even like a knockoff of the iPhone.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.520]   I'm talking about a really bad like flip phone but has like a back illuminated Apple logo
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.720]   on the front on the cover of it that I almost bought.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.280]   I have a bunch of iPhone quote iPhones running Android in my museum over here.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.040]   Oh, back from China.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.840]   Did you see the one where the guy the guy had his iPhone stolen and then but it didn't
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.320]   they didn't unconnect it from his dot me account is not my account.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   And so then the the the the the the Chinese person that ended up buying that used phone
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.240]   was taking all these pictures and and he was it was showing up on his dot me account
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.600]   and he finally figured out who the guy was and they started going back and forth.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   They got along.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.760]   He went and visited him and he turned out to be like a rock star.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.480]   It was a funny connection.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480]   Good way to meet people.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   Let them steal your phone.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   Hey, some really good news.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.280]   I just saw the tweet Disney plus is getting Hamilton.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.280]   My kids.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.680]   October 15th Hamilton's theatrical release.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.920]   One Disney. Oh, 2021.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.960]   It's like a year and a half from now.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   The good news.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.960]   I got a little care.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   By then.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960]   Come on.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:25.960]   Good news.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.120]   I don't have to turn Hamilton's waited this many hundred years Leo.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.200]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.200]   I don't have to turn.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   But the plus back on until man.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200]   You get time.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.200]   You've got to.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.120]   So it's come out theatrical probably won't be till 2022 before you have to turn Disney
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.120]   plus back.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.120]   You can watch the man.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120]   I kept it.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.160]   I kept it for a couple weeks and I was like, I am not using this and I just turned it off.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160]   I was like, okay, I'm done.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.960]   They are definitely going to go for a theatrical release because they definitely want to have
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   it get.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.720]   If you have to make sure that people get a chance to win some Oscars and that's a good
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.720]   idea.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.840]   But for me, the best news is that it's not going to be like the producers.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.600]   It's not going to be like Hello, Dolly, where they try to take this beautiful stage musical
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.600]   at or cats.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.600]   No, no, a good example where they tried.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.040]   Oh, we have to make it into a movie.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.080]   So we're going to cut the best numbers.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.560]   And also we're going to like all they all they did was they had the forethought to know
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560]   that you know what?
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.680]   This is going to be it's going to be really, really valuable at some point in the future
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:23.040]   if before the original cast's contract go go buy buy.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.240]   We just film an entire performance with the original cast on the original stage with all
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.920]   the original blocking and everything because let's just put that in a vault somewhere because
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.280]   in a few years time after we think that everybody who was capable of spending $800 for ticket
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.080]   has spent that $800.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.080]   We want to release it.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   This is this is the reason why although I have had I have had opportunities to spend $350
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.280]   or $400 to go see Hamilton a because of a cheapskate but also because I know that they
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.320]   have in a vault somewhere a really good film of this and I kind of want to see that with
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.320]   the original cast.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.080]   I hope they shoot it in 8k.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.480]   They already shot it.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480]   It's the original cast.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.280]   They are shot of the Richard Rogers theater.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280]   It's done.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.280]   It's it's we're shot on iPhone.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.280]   It's fine.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.480]   No, I remember the rumor that they were they had those two.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.720]   I remember the rumor they had they had filmed it when the cast was still there.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:18.080]   We managed to see it a few weeks before the original cast broke up and it's amazing and
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.280]   highly recommend it was filmed in 2016 during the original run.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   I hope more musicals do this.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   It's just a great opportunity.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.280]   I wish they wouldn't wait so long.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.680]   I guess for me it's like in 2016 makes me feel like they're probably just 1080p maybe
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.680]   even 10.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.680]   Oh yeah.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.680]   Well, it'll be it'll be fine.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.160]   It's not it's not about the frame rate.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.160]   It could have frame rate.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.160]   It's not about the frame rate.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   It's not about the 2016 2016.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.480]   I would so prefer the Lion King theatrical than that remake CGI movie.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.800]   You know, good point.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.880]   Get Julie Tamer up on the stage.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:56.240]   This is why this is one of my gray area gray areas when it comes to like copyrighted content
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   being pirated.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.920]   It's like I don't I absolutely I absolutely have a hundred percent and it gets I know
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.160]   seriously I'm absolutely 100% against people sneaking phones into into theaters and I'm
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:13.320]   100% but if that exists and you know that the like the 1991 revival of Guys and Dolls
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.920]   like that the only the only way to like revisit that that amazing cast and that amazing revival
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:25.000]   is somebody happened to sneak it's it's obviously inside a like a grocery bag or something
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.920]   because 1991 technology but I will say what were you were very naughty to have done that
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.640]   and where's the download link for that yeah otherwise these things disappearing you can't
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.520]   let creative creative works just disappear it's it's cruel well that's the good news is
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:44.320]   I would imagine in the era of iPhones that everything is recorded now and there's we had
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.520]   angry Arnold Schwarzenegger come to Montreal and yell at us because apparently we were
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.480]   the phone bootleg capital the world and he was just like you're stealing our movies oh
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:59.360]   boy your country is stealing our movies so angry so angry don't copy that floppy Renee
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:08.640]   so it's the end of the world as we know it the EU has snubbed apples please to overwhelmingly
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:15.320]   vote to push for a charging cable standard now the implementation details good news it's
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:25.320]   mini USB nobody needs to panic I'm not sure what the upshot of this will be it was you
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.800]   know clearly they were worried about the landfill waste and they didn't pay any attention to
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:34.160]   apples complaints they'll claim by like their YouTube regulations and their how bloggers
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.840]   are allowed to link regulations what could possibly go wrong yeah we'll see that there
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.400]   is a lot still to be determined this is just a resolution well and I guess the question
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.320]   is whether Apple can build just give it an adapter I mean I don't know understand you
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.240]   know don't know if it yeah it should it should be that the thing that they're really worried
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.080]   about isn't the end that plugs into your phone is the end that plugs into the wall they acknowledge
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:02.000]   that adapters are perfectly fine it's just this big bulky brick that they think that
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.280]   we standardize on one kind of brick that will work with pretty much anything that's
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:12.160]   going to be fine they've also they've also noted in the first in the first public statements
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:17.000]   they're making about this three weeks ago or so during a plenary session they mentioned
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.560]   how they started getting on this in about seven or eight years ago and during that time they've
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.440]   gone from about 40 different types of chargers to only about two or three so they also acknowledge
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:31.520]   that this is no longer the big problem that it once was but it's still they see as a solvable
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.480]   problem in terms of e-waste.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:42.400]   Apple lost a big patent suit it says it will appeal Caltech sued Apple and Broadcom over
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:52.080]   Wi-Fi patents and a jury awarded Apple or Caltech $837.8 million from Apple $270 million
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:59.400]   from Broadcom more than $1 billion a big payday for Caltech but don't start counting
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   the money just yet.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.960]   It's a weird one though because it's weird in several ways one is that Broadcom if anyone
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.560]   was infringing the patent at work it was Broadcom but Apple has the big the big bucks so you
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:16.280]   add Apple to the lawsuit but Apple's not the only licensor of Broadcom so if we go by so
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.440]   either your theory is that Broadcom is liable for patent infringement if it can be proven
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.680]   and not the companies that buy stuff from Broadcom or every company that buy stuff from Broadcom
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.080]   is then liable and then any company that buys anything from anyone is liable to the infringement
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.960]   of the company they buy from and this just seems like bad lot of me no matter which way
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.920]   no matter which way you look at it.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.480]   Well it's going to be another few years.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.000]   I mean the Verton X. The Verton X patents over FaceTime have been going on for ten years
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.400]   and they've been reduced again and again so.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.760]   I can say it speaks well of Apple that even though they are one of these richest companies
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.160]   in terms of having actual cash on hand they don't act like one of those trust fund kids
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.880]   who just like side swipes a vehicle while drunk says here's $10,000 I don't care if
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.720]   they were jerks they would just be paying all these fines and just moving on with their
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.920]   lives instead of actually fighting it on the tentative basis that they're right.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.360]   They're playing a way to get suit more and more if they give in easily.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.560]   So the where you go more simoleons make it rain make it rain you got to make it you
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.720]   have as a company like that you have to make it painful.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.680]   I know I know.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:33.680]   The WebKit team at Apple has proposed a way to make text messages one time passwords secure
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.320]   as we know with simjacking they are not secure they really are problematic and we always encourage
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:45.040]   people to use either an authenticator app or a hardware authentication key like the
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.320]   Yuba Key.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:55.040]   Apple engineers proposed and Google agreed to and perhaps will adopt as well a standard
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.320]   messaging system that would make it more secure.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:05.520]   OTP SMS messages that can be associated with a URL by adding a login URL inside the SMS
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.640]   itself and then to standardize the format of these messages so that browsers and mobile
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:16.320]   apps can easily detect the incoming SMS recognize the web domain inside the message that automatically
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.840]   extract the OTP code and complete the login all of that's nice I don't know how that makes
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.560]   it more secure.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:28.040]   I'll have to read more about this maybe Steve Gibson will talk about it.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.880]   It's also really cool for me because this is like a new sorry the ideas you won't fall
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:37.760]   for a scam text message that it will be so automated that the scam message wouldn't
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.560]   work but it doesn't solve the simjacking problem I think but I don't know go ahead I'm
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.560]   sorry Rene.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.840]   No no no no it's just this is a new team at Apple I believe within the last year that
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.920]   this was formed and their whole goal is to make the Web both more secure and more human
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.480]   because they realize that security by itself could be you know you could you could lock
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.560]   yourself out you could become unusable but convene too much convenience and people start
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.240]   getting taken advantage of so their whole goal is just to sit there and come up with
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.520]   new and better ways to provide us with security that is still user friendly and this is the
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.160]   first thing we've seen from them which I think is exciting.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.400]   You were excited about foundation I think when we talked last week.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:20.280]   We now learn from a nice little site called imore.com that it will be large the largest
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.880]   ever production shot in Ireland.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.640]   They begin shooting later this year in Limerick.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:33.360]   Foundation is an Apple original drama series that based on of course the incredible Isaac
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.280]   Azimov series.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:43.040]   500 project production jobs will be created with over 40 skills are they making all how
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.640]   many of the novels that they make there quite a few foundations.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.760]   I don't think they say yeah I guess like it'll depend on how many seasons they.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.760]   Yes that's right.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.640]   By the way how you build an industry somewhere it's a great whatever they're doing.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.680]   Well is it Ireland already I mean pretty big TV production.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.680]   It is but nothing at that scale.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.160]   Yeah and wasn't able to shut a lot of it was shut in Ireland.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.840]   I thought it was some in Ireland I think a lot in Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   No Croatia but I think that you know.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:20.120]   You saw when we were visiting Diocletian's palace in Croatia they said don't take any pictures
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   of that.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   So why does that?
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.480]   Don't take any pictures of that it's off limits.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.320]   It was a staircase it was the place that the dragons were stored in the castle.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.320]   Oh wow.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.480]   And there was a staircase that they built that wasn't there originally they built.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480]   That's all.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.880]   Don't take any pictures of that.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   It's okay.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.880]   Fine.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   So yeah.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.560]   Do you know where that limerick.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.520]   Do you imagine like in three or four hundred years there could be archaeologists were going
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.720]   to find like your points and dragon teeth.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.880]   It's like oh my god previous group missed this.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880]   What was going on.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.200]   They must have had virtual houses that you simply walk up to and then walk into the energy.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.760]   There's a door but no home.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:08.320]   This is known as the spirit cabin as most of these people had rather interesting beliefs
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.160]   and deities so they would create a door that goes nowhere.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:15.040]   So that the evil spirits would be lit up Elijah door.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:21.400]   LG TVs are starting to arrive with Apple TV installed.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:28.800]   This is a big deal and compatible 2019 LG smart TVs you'll be able to get Apple TV.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.000]   You I still don't think you should plug those into it.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.800]   I am so delighted though that there is not the light is the wrong way but I'm it's amazing
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.120]   to me that there are engineers sitting like at results way or infinite loop or somewhere
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.280]   making the TV app for Tizen for WebOS.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.640]   That's why and they're going what are we compiling this in I don't know open GLF it
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.160]   just do it.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.640]   It's all written in Python.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.120]   Let's see what else what are their stories.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.040]   Can you talk a little bit more about why because I have a smart TV that I have not connected
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.040]   to the Internet.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.120]   I think I have a similar feeling as you about this.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.120]   Why do you think it's a bad idea to connect your smart TV to the Internet and take advantage
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.920]   of the apps like directly from the TV.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.720]   There's two there's two problems.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.400]   One is the chipsets in the TVs are a lot cheaper than the Apple TV.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.960]   So they're not going to be able to process.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.120]   They're not going to process the video as well.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.960]   Secondly the and and I have trouble even with some of the Apple TV stuff where we're not
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:35.520]   getting the frame rates that I would expect.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.960]   There's certain like Netflix for instance for some reason has a lot of frame rate issues
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.480]   for me anyway when I'm watching certain things in high motion and I don't know if anyone
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.960]   else notices it drives me crazy just certain places where you start to see things not coming
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   back together.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:57.280]   You never see it when on Apple on iTunes and you never you rarely see it on Disney looks
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.320]   good but when you start getting to the other ones that there's a variety of issues and
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.360]   those TVs will have more of those issues.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.600]   Secondly and more importantly is that they're all talking to home.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.040]   I mean you're there's no real rules set up for those things and there's you know you
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.080]   don't know what kind of security is there so you're you're giving a lot of data to them.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.920]   You know and I don't see for me I just decided to keep it simple and just the phone this
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:26.520]   TV say where they are which is dumb and the Apple TV you know is empowered to talk to the
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:31.000]   Internet and I just found it simpler to keep it all in one box rather than it also makes
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.920]   it easier for me to move the Apple TV around to different TVs and it's a much it's a seamless
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.760]   experience and so you know so some convenience I think there's some performance issues and
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:48.600]   then security so for those three reasons I'm not a big fan of connecting it to the Internet.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600]   That makes sense.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.520]   I don't know what Andy what are your what's your opinion on that.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:59.200]   I just don't trust when they got when they're trying when they're selling a 4k HDR 65 and
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:04.200]   screen for 400 bucks they're making some money somewhere and so that's why I really
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.920]   don't want this thing talking to the Internet if I can prevent that from happening and also
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.760]   for the reasons that you that you that you explain that I have I have a really really
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:18.640]   cheap TV box on the TV in my living room.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.960]   I have a really I've got $300 one on the TV in my living room and just the speed the
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:29.480]   quality the of the video everything is so much better on having a separate box that
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:35.120]   costs made by a graphics card company that knows how to process live streaming graphics.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.480]   So yeah I'm totally with you.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.280]   I'm also like in the Alex camp where I would love I know like the current Apple TV 4k people
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.920]   think it's like overpowered but when you get to HDR and then you start doing overlays
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.640]   on it you you can still peg it so I would actually love it if Apple would put out a like a second
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:55.600]   edition 4k that has a two or a year later processor that could really just smash through
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.680]   even multi-layer composite at HDR that would make me super I was kind of bummed that the
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:06.400]   Super Bowl wasn't in 4k HDR on the Apple TV was in 4k but not HDR so I had to use a
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.200]   Chromecast Ultra for the HDR by the way that looks good.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   Did you try it?
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:17.400]   No I don't I so Fox was streaming it but you had to use a streaming app or be using
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:26.440]   Dish or Xfinity but I watched on Fox Sports Sports app on the Roku Ultra 4k HDR they shot
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:32.200]   at 1080p 60 and then upscale to 4k but it wasn't HDR it looks spectacular.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.200]   I would love to watch all of the other.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.200]   I was the worst part wasn't it was it?
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.720]   Yeah because it's hard to do both it's hard to deliver HDR and SDR well YouTube still can
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.720]   do it.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.720]   Oh you know what the SDR was?
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:47.360]   I did I had a SDR at first because I was watching on some other app and then I was
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:51.760]   in the Apple TV for some reason had 4k but I guess the HDR that they were doing that
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.720]   wasn't compatible with the Apple.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:59.160]   All I know is that YouTube promoted YouTube TV for the Super Bowl and I happen to watch
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.160]   it because all I have I don't have I've been a cord cutter for a couple decades and so
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:09.200]   I don't have any way to get you know it always asks you for a broadcast license or whatever
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.120]   and so I don't have any way to do that and so I was watching I watched the Super Bowl
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:17.400]   on a you know on YouTube TV which is like the worst experience.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.400]   Didn't look so good.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.360]   I mean it's you know anytime there's high motion it starts breaking up and then the ticker
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.120]   tape was just squares.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:28.040]   Like it was just I like when the ticker came my kids were like what happened to the picture
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.840]   I'm like that's called macro blocking and I had this long talk with my 10 year old.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:35.560]   In a way you didn't have to sign up or anything.
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.560]   I probably should have.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.360]   You know I I I it was amazing I just got back.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   I just got back.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.360]   I watch all sports now.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:47.520]   Amazon their Thursday night executions were after the first one the first one there was
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.640]   some issues but after that the their their 4k execution was truly.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:56.680]   It's amazing there was no stuttering the audio is perfect the sync was perfect.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:01.400]   I'm sure there were millions of people watching simultaneously and it was flawless.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:06.040]   They really they figured this out didn't their open GL app is horrible though.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040]   Oh well.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.680]   You can't win them all.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:12.840]   I got to as somebody in the chat room said I got to cry in HDR.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:18.920]   They got my wife a couple times she was like she got she got hit on the Google one and
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:22.560]   then there was another one a couple of HDR Shakira and J.Lo.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.280]   I mean like you just win the Internet with that.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.680]   That was pretty awesome.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.440]   Yeah that was pretty awesome.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.360]   I was very happy to see that.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.200]   Let's take a little break when we come back your picks folks you want to do that.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.200]   Sure.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   All right.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.160]   Our show brought to you quite literally by cash fly.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.920]   Actually I'm going to ask you about this Alex because I don't know what a 100% cash hit
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.680]   ratio means in the context of a content delivery network.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:50.560]   I'm sorry I didn't mean to put you on the spot.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.120]   Look at my I'll tell you then you tell me okay.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:59.600]   Cash fly we use cash fly we have for over a decade petabytes of data a month through cash
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.760]   fly as with most content delivery services.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.840]   The idea is you have servers at the edge.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:11.160]   So when somebody is downloading it either getting it not from me or from my host but
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.600]   from a server close to them right that's the whole idea.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.600]   Right.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.240]   I think that I believe that what they mean there because cash fly is a little different
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:21.680]   than what we do because we're doing live and they're doing they do a little live but they're
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.680]   doing mostly.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.480]   Yeah but when you download our shows it's just saying that we're not coming back to one
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:30.760]   central location it's going to massively increase if you know that a 100% of the time it's out
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:34.880]   in the you know it's cashed in the in the edge that you're going to get a much better
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:40.160]   performance of how your bits that's the new feature and cash fly they call it 100% cash
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:45.640]   shield and the reason that that's important is that usually what happens is that when you
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.200]   when you ask for a piece of content you go back to the origin like where it was sitting
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.880]   and you ask for it now everywhere through that edge now starts to have it right once
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:58.560]   it goes through the it's cast everywhere but it's cashed as you do it in what they're doing
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.280]   here is their auto pop up in it propagating it so they're no matter when people hit it
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280]   they're going to get that con.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:08.440]   Not only is it better performance it also saves you money it's a drastic reduction in
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:14.560]   data transfer fees with AWS's S3 and other cloud storage origins because you're not getting
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:20.240]   it from them anymore you download a copy it spreads to the cash right that's where your
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.360]   listeners your users are getting it that your cash hit ratio is now a hundred percent and
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.640]   in this day and age we were just talking about 4k customers expect that instantaneous delivery
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:37.480]   they wanted to work anytime anywhere in the world on any device if it's your web page
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:42.360]   it's if your web page is slow to load your video is buffering if your games aren't downloading
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:52.280]   if your podcast isn't flowing that hurts you and cash fly was amazing 12 to 12 years ago
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.280]   when we when we did that when we covered the high the home high high fire whatever you
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:01.080]   know and we put 400 meg file which is not a big deal now but it was in 2006 or whatever
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:06.840]   and I think I actually got a an email from Matt going what are you transferring you look
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:10.600]   like you know like I need to know like they've always been good about it but they manage it
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:16.400]   no one noticed so the key here is your cached items are not getting evicted for large one
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:21.680]   offer quests costing you a fortune and data transfer out fees with a hundred percent cash
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.920]   feel a cash shield and cash fly's guaranteed availability it's as simple it happens automatically

[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:41.560]   having traffic on other companies you can buy as much space as you want your data is
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.360]   fetched from the hundred percent cash shield rather than from origin shielding reduces
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:53.080]   your origin spend by thousands a month guaranteeing no cash misses it also remarkably improves
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:59.000]   download speeds no buffering and guaranteed availability with the highest quality of service
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.200]   easily and reliably scale your video streaming to reach a global audience of any size you know

[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:15.160]   this is the kinds of technology advances that make this stuff possible hyper-fast download speeds

[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:18.840]   check it out Lori Gill your pick of the week I'm going with the new game that just came out a
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:26.040]   couple days ago spell tower plus you may have remembered spell tower from many years ago a very
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:34.120]   addicting word game while they came out with a new version they brought it back it's new and better
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:40.840]   has all these great new games on it plus the the old ones that we love so much so if you like word
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:45.640]   games I've been playing it every single day since it came out and I've been having a lot of fun it's
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:54.200]   free to download it comes it has ads if you don't spend the 4.99 to unlock the full mode and when you
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.280]   do unlock the full mode you get a couple of extra puzzle options so it comes with tower and puzzle
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:05.480]   and then you unlock all the other additional ones with that 4.99 purchase it's so much fun it just
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:11.480]   I just that they're playing it for hours at a time it's really really great and there's different
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:16.360]   versions that you can play or not versions but the different puzzles give you you know right now I
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:23.240]   feel like just searching for one really big word so I'll use search or right now I feel like playing
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:29.720]   a you know reverse Tetris style version of a word game so you play puzzle and the
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:37.560]   the tiles like disappear as you or new tiles appear as you create words and or I just want sort of
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:43.560]   like a Zen mode style thing then you just play tower and that just has all of the the words in
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.360]   there and you try to just delete them delete all of the tiles as you go along so it's really fun
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.600]   really relaxing and it's free if you want to play just a couple of games and if you want to if you
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:56.520]   really like it and you want to spend a little bit of money on it it's only five bucks to get the

[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:19.880]   use it one I get it okay uh spell tower plus Zack Cage thank you Lori Gill imore.com
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:26.200]   speaking of imore Renee Richie's got my pick so I tell you what let's share this one because it's
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:30.760]   gonna be my pick too it's a little controversial but I think that's what I was gonna start with
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:37.000]   it yeah go ahead all right so yeah whenever an app switches business models especially most
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.520]   recently with the subscription model it always becomes really controversial because we live in a
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.800]   time where apps have crossed the boundary there's always a point in time where media goes from being
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:54.440]   scarce and expensive to being abundant plentiful and then being sort of commonplace and people just
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.040]   don't want to pay as much for it I sit here as someone who is in the news industry and I can tell
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:02.440]   you how much people used to pay for news compared to what they're prepared to pay for it now and apps
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:06.520]   went through a similar thing with the advent of the app store in the google play store where we went
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:12.440]   from you know really expensive box software to how many free apps can I download today and especially
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:17.160]   indie developers people who don't just give it away on top of a service or you know or a big company
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:23.080]   and do it for marketing but indie developers people who love to craft apps have had a hard time
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:27.880]   maintaining their business much less working on upgrades and a whole bunch of reasons for that
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.440]   but subscription pricing is the latest thing that a lot of developers are trying and Fantastic
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:39.240]   Cal which is my go-to calendar app on iOS and the Mac has just switched to that kind of plan they're
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.320]   trying to lighten the load on people who are going oh not another subscription app by giving you
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:51.400]   like there's a full a full Apple watch version the iPhone and iPad version of merge now so there's
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:57.000]   just one version to maintain between those two the Mac version it's very very close to feature
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.080]   parity if not exactly there and there's some really cool new features like there's weather
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:06.200]   integrated everywhere you literally see the weather for anything you want to do or anything you are
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.840]   doing there's interesting calendars of all sorts and types like you can see when your favorite tv
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.320]   shows are on and Laurie and I were doing this thing where we send each other times to schedule
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.920]   an appointment and she's like I can do two o'clock but not three o'clock and I said I can do 12
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:25.560]   but ah that doesn't work and two or three times we nailed a time so it's got a lot more features
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.000]   you do have to pay for it monthly if you are a pre-existing Fantastic Cal user and you don't
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.840]   want the subscription you can get the free version that will extra unlock the additional feature as
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:42.680]   you used to have your sort of grandfather grandmother into that but you don't get all the new features
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.720]   if you want all the new features you do have to subscribe but that team is amazing and I have no
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:51.800]   doubts they're going to do everything they can to provide ongoing value so I'm super super happy
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:58.120]   with the new Fantastic Cal. Yeah I am such a fan of Flexibits and I use car hogs at Michael's
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:04.520]   amazing I of course as soon as I saw Fantastic Cal came out an update came out I bought it immediately
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.720]   and I don't mind the subscription because I want to keep these guys right in software I'm always
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.680]   suspicious. Yeah you're paying for the next version that's what you're really doing is paying for the
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:19.000]   next version and it's such a good tool and I just I'm just a huge fan so it doesn't bother me at all
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.960]   it is always hard I mean if we started charging you for Mac break weekly we'd hear about it yeah
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.120]   for a show too imagine like it was and also can't I keep I keep saying Michael Simmons his partner
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.760]   Kent is also amazing deserves tons of tons of credit too. They both get credit okay yeah I
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:38.840]   love it I'm using it on my watch I'm using it on my Mac I'm using it on my iOS devices it's just
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:46.120]   fantastic. I'm absolutely thrilled by any decision a developer makes to let them to make it easier
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.880]   for them to keep supporting and keep improving the product or even just keep to continue to make
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:59.000]   the work that they put into it worth it in terms of beer or the electrical bill or whatever I it's
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.280]   it's not a question of I always my position is that when an individual creator tells you how much
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.360]   they're charging for this thing that they've created they are never asking for too much money
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:12.520]   it's always worth exactly what the creator has asked for it the only question is whether it's
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.240]   amount of money that I can afford or even just an amount of money that I'm willing to pay but I'm
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:23.240]   not going to give I'm not going to heap abuse upon a developer for saying hi well I've been using
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:28.360]   that I've been stuffing cardboard inside my shoes for the past two years to to patch the holes in
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:35.000]   it I would like to be able to afford like one of those insoles so to raise 30 dollars I'm going to
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.040]   have to raise the price 30 cents and then oh my god the abuse they get online and it helps when
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:48.520]   the product is as good as Fantastical because that's like I have a fee I like to feel as though
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:52.840]   Apple someone in Apple has said we should really but we should really buy this company make it
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:59.080]   part of the US and then someone else said no because we'd only ruin it we can we count on
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:05.400]   Fantastical Fantastical way too much to jeopardize it so let's just keep paying the user please
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:11.800]   three dollars 33 cents a month if you pay annually five dollars a month if you pay monthly
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:17.560]   yes that comes to forty dollars a year I pay the forty dollars a year is yeah well worth it
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:23.400]   well worth for an app you use not just every day but all day I live in it and and yeah if only for
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:27.960]   the quick entry of appointments it would be worth it but there's so much other and lots of new
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:32.600]   features too I'm excited yeah I hate calendars that he makes me use them so I have a love
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:39.880]   hate but it's still a great app Andy I used to use caffeine but Andy's gone on to harder stuff his
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:47.560]   pick of the week well I am a professional writer my pick is amphetamine a really it's a little bit
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:54.440]   like Fantastical where it focuses on one job but it does it so extremely and thoroughly well all it
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:59.960]   does is prevent your Mac from going to sleep or or your screen from going to screen saver or going
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:06.760]   to low power mode and every single time you've given a presentation and the the last five minutes
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:11.400]   before the presentation you have to go into settings and adjust four or five different things to make
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.760]   damn sure that you don't have the thing where you're right in the middle of making an important
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:19.000]   point but then you have to run back to the lectern to wake up your machine again but you also have to
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.800]   reauthenticate because it's it locked the screen again this will just make sure that no matter what
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:28.840]   happens for either the amount of time that you designate or until you turn this off that screen
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:34.840]   will not go to sleep or other features that are sort of related to that but that's the simple thing
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.680]   you just click on this little menu menu bar item and that's what happens and then because this is
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:46.120]   this has been out for a number of years they just went to the sophistication route of saying how about
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:52.040]   you know how about if every time it will automatically turn itself on and prevent your screen from
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:57.000]   waking whenever you plug in a USB device that you've designated as oh here's my presentation
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.640]   remote or anytime the keynote is running or anytime you're connected to the Wi-Fi network
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.880]   that covers like this conference room whenever it just sees that it will just automatically
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:12.040]   not put your screen to sleep that by itself makes it worthwhile yeah because I mean when I give I
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:16.120]   have a I have a laptop in front of me when I do radio and other things where you can't see me so I
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:20.040]   don't have to look as though I remember all this stuff and that is what I have to do like on these
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:24.920]   other machines to make sure that this thing doesn't blank out on me on a good also I'm doing a there's
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.920]   a lot of stuff that I'm just maintenance stuff that I happen to be doing over the past couple of
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.640]   weeks that involves typing in a bunch of terminal commands and then for the next four hours
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:38.520]   just lines of green text start burbling over the next two or three hours toward the screen and I
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:43.080]   just want to have that screen visible in the room so I could just occasionally glance at that and
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:47.800]   make sure that this thing is has not terminated early so just the ability to simply go into the
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:52.600]   menu bar and click a button to make that happen as opposed to again going to four different types
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:57.320]   of settings make it happen the other great thing is that it is freeware it is one of the pieces of
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:02.760]   freeware that immediately like after the first time I used it I went and used the link to give the
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:07.720]   developer some money because it is so well done but yeah have this it will solve so many problems
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.240]   for you and prevents so much embarrassment I like the triggers I've been using caffeine but
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:15.480]   these triggers are going to really be useful because then you just kind of automate when it when
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.480]   it stays away instead of having to click the little coffee cup my understanding is that it's
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.960]   based on caffeine but it took a two the next level yeah yeah very exactly what ampettavines are
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:30.920]   exactly based on caffeine but takes it to the next level speed kills kids and now
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:38.680]   Alex Lindsay's pick of the week so so this is a brand new app that I only got to play with a
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:44.680]   little bit this morning because it just was released I want to thank Alex Golmer in the UK who
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:49.800]   put it up on Twitter and I was and I saw it and I was like oh I have to check this out and I opened
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:56.680]   it up and I was like oh I really like this and so I so this is a motion graphics it's called
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:02.840]   Calvary and it is a motion graphics software that I think was just released yesterday or just in
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:07.960]   beta it's in beta so right now it's a free beta download so it's you can go and go play with it
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.960]   you don't have to believe me just go check it out and here's what I really like about it number
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:17.400]   one is it's very modern now what it feels like is this kind of mix between so I've been using
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:25.080]   After Effects since it was made by a company called COSA and and motion since 1.0 and and so
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:30.680]   what this feels like is the two of them had a baby you know and so you have you have all these
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:36.920]   duplication and behaviors that you see in motion that make things super fast and easy but you have
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:41.880]   a more After Effects interface and so if you're kind of like you wish motion looked and felt a
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:48.200]   little bit more like After Effects then you're kind of in the right place I don't know if it
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.240]   does anything like visual effects it doesn't look like it it looks like it's mostly just there for
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:59.400]   motion graphics but if you're doing really cool if you want to have you know really great motion
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:05.240]   graphics for presentations for videos for those types of things it looks amazing one of the things
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.240]   that I thought was really cool that I wanted in motion for a long time which is I wanted to connect
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:16.120]   my data to numbers and so I could change my numbers document and change the graph that's being
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.000]   animated and inside of motion nice what these guys do is actually they're not using numbers but
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:27.960]   they're using Google Docs so you can literally have you can tie a graph in this app to a Google
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:35.480]   Docs document and as you're changing those data it's updating the yeah and then you can give it
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.840]   all these behaviors you've got you know there's a lot of you know all kinds of really really good
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:46.200]   type and you know it's for people who really want to push the outer envelope again it's in beta
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.640]   it just got announced yesterday I just saw it today I played with it for a couple hours this
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.840]   morning and I'm pretty pretty impressed with it it's worth at least downloading playing with and
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.760]   seeing if it if it makes sense for your workflow if you're a graphic artist they'll charge for it
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.840]   eventually right I'm sure they will I'm just saying that at the moment though and this is the time to
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:09.000]   go play with it right because right now it's also in beta which means if there's something you don't
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.920]   like this is this is where you where the the clay may not be at all the way hardened so you might
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:20.760]   go to get something that you might want I've already you know I've already sent a bunch of requests
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.360]   he's smiling so big a couple hours now like this is great you need to add this this this this
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:33.800]   you know so very nice cavalry it's a windows or mac yeah windows or mac yeah cavalry dot scene

[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.400]   on the should be right up but there it is there is a 16 by nine version it's not very long because

[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.760]   Can you get a thought about killing me?
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.560]   Oh yeah
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.040]   Really?
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:36.520]   Sure

[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.080]   Wow
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:43.720]   I know
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:44.840]   Is it Fargo?
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:45.080]   Yeah
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:50.520]   So what's that dialogue from?
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.080]   It's
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.680]   I it's oh no I can't remember it
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:55.480]   You know what happens in tiktok is you don't know what the the dialogues for
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.600]   Oh yeah yeah you just take it
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.640]   You say I want that audio
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:57.880]   Yeah
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.720]   So I pulled the audio down made it now
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:00.440]   This is where you go
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.280]   Do you shot this by the way in 6k
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:04.680]   I shot it in 4k on a 6k camera
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.600]   And I shot it
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.960]   And so I shot it
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.640]   Admittedly I took it in too far
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.560]   I mean but it's what I do you know if you can't over it
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:12.600]   You use magic
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:12.920]   You know
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:13.480]   Pull it
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:18.680]   So I used yeah so we did we did a shot it in 4k I should have shot it in 6k I was in kind of a rush
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:20.840]   And then shot it in log though
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:23.240]   So it's shot in log so I was able to bring it into final cut
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.560]   Add I added colorista and then I added
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:28.680]   Magic bullet on it to kind of clean it all up
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.760]   And and does look good
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:34.040]   It's fun what's fun about it is is my kids and I can you know
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:36.600]   I get to play with it from a filmmaker perspective
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:39.080]   And it's really nice and short and the kids love doing this
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:42.200]   Oh it's so much fun for them and you know they're good actors
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.160]   They're actually really good at
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:43.880]   They're good
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:46.600]   This is uh they could use this as their audition piece
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.560]   Yeah so they're saying they really uh they really can emote
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.040]   I just love seeing Alex's facial expressions on the kids
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.440]   Like you can just see their his kids right in their facial expressions
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:52:00.120]   All I'm saying is that I I hope you get used to people saying
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:03.400]   Oh yeah they do it because it's the kids love it
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.320]   With a 6-tape production and I can see with their marks taped on the floor
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.560]   No so they'll be oh it's the Lindsay kids father
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.480]   That's going to be his new name the Lindsay kids father
