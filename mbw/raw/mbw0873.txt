[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where you cover the latest Apple news and old boy is
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.040]   there Apple news. Alex Lindsey is here from office hours.global and 090.media. Hello, Alex. I think
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   you're drooling. Hello. I think his drool is showing. A little excited. Wipe your mouth.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.480]   It looks pretty good. I think we had over 100 people in their watching yesterday for a second
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.440]   a year. And everyone was just tearing. There was half of us were like, you know, half of the group
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.800]   was like, oh, it's never going to work. And no one's ever going to buy that. And the other half was
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.480]   like, I can't wait. Where do I order? Where do I put my credit card down? So it's proof.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.280]   So proof.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.840]   Mr. Andy and I co-wgph boss. He's got his view master.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.840]   I'm under I'm under NDA. So there's some things I can't talk about. But as soon as like the.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200]   I can see his eyes. Yes.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.360]   A little uncanny. Exactly. You know, I've gone for the hellhound.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.800]   That's sort of a place. You can only see the whites of the eyes.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.120]   And then you tell me if I look like a dork in this, didn't you? Yeah. No.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.040]   Maybe. Jason Snell is on assignment. He's he's down in the tennis courts.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.120]   He's petting dinosaurs. Some place.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.200]   Yeah. This is petting dinosaurs. But we're very pleased that Micah came home.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.720]   I did. I ran home.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.600]   Micah Sergeant sitting in the chair. Good to see you. You were there yesterday.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.880]   I was there yesterday. I did want to say. A nice gentleman. Oscar says hello, Leo.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.960]   And thank you for everything. Oscar the grouch. I if I can real quick, I was in the elevator
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.160]   about to make my way back to the car. And this guy from across the elevator suddenly
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.560]   does a double take. I see. And he points at me. And then he goes,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:51.040]   to it. That's. And I said, yes. And he goes. For what? Forgive me. Forgive. I said Micah.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.200]   He could saw Micah Sergeant. Oh, where's Leo? And I said,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.640]   something people of Apple have been asking for the last 22 years.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.560]   Yes. And then he was very kind and said that he and his kids watched all the shows.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   Hi, Oscar. Hello, Oscar.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.560]   I hope you're having fun down there at WWDC, the 2023 edition.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   Yeah, we covered the keynote. I did it because we had planned to do it with you. And then you
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.480]   got a last minute of a tation. But that gave me a great opportunity to bring people up onto
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.360]   the stage from the club. How was that? It was great. It was the, you know, it was Kev Brewer,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.920]   it was Joe Esposito, Joe from Brooklyn. It was the usuals. But it was really, I thought quite
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.120]   fun. I thought they did a very good job. And what was interesting, I was talking with one of the
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.840]   producers afterwards. And they said, they knew the rhythm of how we do these keynotes, like when
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.920]   to talk. Oh, really? When not to talk. It was really, it was, it was true. They watched a few.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:54.960]   That's cool. So if I were a smart, canny podcaster, I would save one more thing for the end.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.640]   As if it is one more thing. As if it were one more thing, just like Tim Cook did.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.600]   We were sitting here. I'm sure you were saying, okay, you've gone an hour and a half, I think.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   It was getting long.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.240]   Actually, at one point, I was really wondering, maybe they're not going to introduce this.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.640]   We had that feeling too, sitting there, thought maybe it just wasn't time.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.680]   It was wrong. I mean, that would be really a big deal given how much publicity, but they never
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.000]   said they were going to introduce it. Exactly. You know, Tim has been saying,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.480]   A-R-A-R-A-R for a while. So, you know, we know he was very interested in this.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   And before the event started, there was a moment where both Craig Federighi and Tim Cook were on
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.640]   stage. And what gave me the hint that they were going to was right before the video that everybody
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   else got to see from out in the world saw. Tim Cook said something along the lines of,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.440]   "This is going to be an historic day." I love that he used the "and" historic day.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.280]   And then that's whenever the video started, the part that was streamed live elsewhere.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.000]   And so I thought, okay, definitely at the end. But then it just kept going and going.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.920]   And I'm looking over at Jason Snell, he was sitting next to me and are they going?
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.000]   Yeah, they won more thing. When they won more thing, they also won more thing, the price.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.920]   And this was the reaction from the crowd. Oh, I'm glad someone captured that.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.400]   It's incredible. It starts at 34.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:30.080]   That is not a sound effect. That was the real sound in the audience.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.200]   That was so intense that I really honestly had to reach out to a friend of mine who was there
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.240]   and say, "Did that really happen?" He said, "Yes, yes, it was anything. It was even louder."
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.480]   We didn't hear it, of course, because Apple, once again, even in the absence of COVID, because
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.520]   you were all there, you were unmasked, you didn't get special Apple.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.800]   Yeah, there weren't tests this time.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   High-fly masks, no tests.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.680]   They still decided to do it recorded. So tell me how it happened.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.000]   You're sitting in the press from what I could tell from your tweets and others, you were
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.880]   kind of in the back.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.560]   Yeah, so this time, because there were developers there, they got the front seats.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.000]   And then there was a small row of some of the blessed Apple employees who got to be there,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.560]   because their teams were kind of featured.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.800]   And then right behind that row was the press.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.520]   So we were near the back, but it also gave the press the opportunity to be in the shade shade.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.400]   So we were sort of comfortably sitting, although right where we were, it was with the sun.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.880]   But anyway, you're sitting there and you're looking up at the stage and everything's getting ready.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.360]   They're playing that music. You can see the huge screen.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:41.040]   And what they did in the past, and what they did again this year, is Tim Cook took the stage
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.560]   and talked briefly. And he was saying, he was wearing a light blue shirt.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.280]   And I noticed that.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.200]   Because there was a different shirt in the video.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.520]   Yes.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.280]   He did not attempt to match his outfit.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.320]   Yeah, there was no matching there.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.960]   And they talked for a little bit.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.200]   Craig said a few things and sort of joked about the presentation.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.160]   And then it kicked off.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.040]   There was no after with that.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.720]   As soon as it was over, then we all kind of looked towards our press contacts.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.520]   The our sort of PR people were off to the side and said,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.800]   where do we go next?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.400]   And then they shuffled us off from there.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:18.800]   Yeah. Alex, you were really, you said, I was, I frankly was surprised because I completely
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.160]   disagree with you. You said that they're never going to do a live performance again.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.800]   That this is, this is, you know, so good.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   And I grant you that mean they got a lot of information into two hours
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   and six minutes, but they're never going to do a live event again.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.520]   Yeah. I think that's really a shame because I think you really,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.720]   I feel like you really lose.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.120]   So much.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.040]   Well, yeah, you like to live in a bubble, I guess.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.880]   I miss because you don't go out much.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.080]   No, but people keep on saying, I don't understand why the energy, you know, Google
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.960]   and Microsoft have lost so much energy in their events.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.240]   It's not that they've lost energy.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.560]   It's that Apple's is so much tighter with so much more data and so much,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   it's so much more visual interest that when you go back to a stage,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.720]   it's like going from the highway to a gravel, you know,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.400]   I think you could do a hybrid where you had people.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.080]   I want to see the executives.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.960]   I want to see their energy and enthusiasm.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.640]   I want to see and we didn't see it.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.560]   Tim Cook wearing a vision pro.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.680]   And I think you could do that and introduce videos because I understand it's a much more
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.440]   content rich way to present it and then much more clear.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.120]   But I do think you lose something from not having people on stage.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.760]   I really do.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.240]   And I think Apple's at risk of becoming, they already kind of look like this.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.160]   In fact, even building Apple Park with everything facing in,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.320]   they already look like a company that doesn't participate with it.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   You know, they're in Elysian fields up there somewhere.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.800]   If Google and Microsoft are doing physical events in three years,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.920]   I'll be really surprised.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.960]   I think it's over.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.120]   Like the idea of the keynote is done.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.720]   You know, you put a fork in it.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.840]   Like a maybe, you know, Steve Jobs are still here.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.440]   There would be no question that you would want.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.880]   No, no, he's the one that brought it forward.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.640]   You have to be, but you have to be Steve Jobs or Mark Benioff from Sales.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.080]   Mark Benioff from Salesforce, by the way.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.480]   I don't understand anything he talks about, but he's amazing at talking about it.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.720]   Like his, you know, and he's trained by Tony Robbins and just incredible.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.520]   They're entire staff.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.760]   So if you're at that level and you're willing to spend two hours a week being trained,
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.480]   then I think that doing keynotes makes a lot of sense for you.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.560]   But none of these executives are doing that.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.640]   And all of it is just painful to watch.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.760]   People who are angry.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.720]   It's they're not good at it.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.160]   Tripping through things, reading telepromters, even Apple,
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:45.840]   when Steve was gone, the magic was gone in that process because they're not actors.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.920]   You know, Steve had something that they didn't have.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.520]   Steve made the keynote a keynote because he was so good at it.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.800]   You know, but the thing is, is that that was like, you know, that was a.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.320]   I'd rather see a live a live rock show than a perfect canned performance.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.520]   I'd rather see a Broadway show than a perfect movie.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.080]   Sure, but but but that those are incredible generally.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880]   The talent of people.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.360]   Musicians that are very talented and and spent thousands of hours getting good at it.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.280]   The executives are not those people there.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.640]   It's more like watching a live show of someone who just learned how to play the guitar,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.320]   you know, like like three weeks ago.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.400]   And that's not super exciting.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.880]   You know, like, you know, it's, you know, and that's what they look like.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.480]   What that's what executives look like when they go out on stage is like a kid who just
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.640]   learned how to play the guitar and trying to play you.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.160]   Mary Mary had a little lamb.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.680]   You know, it's just it's really pain.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.320]   I've watched literally thousands of sessions.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   Okay.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.600]   So I think that's bad.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.040]   But but on the other hand, like this isn't Las Vegas.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.440]   This is really is energy engineers and product managers explaining this thing.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.680]   They've been working on for the past seven years.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.120]   It's okay if they don't land that triple jump off the off the off the trampoline.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.240]   You know, it's I had to have to say that maybe the biggest like cognitive disconnect I had
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   was like, wow, I'm seeing pictures of like an audience of people watching a video together
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.440]   on a screen.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.440]   Like I find I mean, and I know that people didn't come the people who traveled to go see it
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.080]   didn't go to see it to watch the video.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.840]   It was because okay, maybe there's going to be a demo area and also I have the ability
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.040]   to talk to people afterward.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.760]   But oh my goodness, if if you didn't if you didn't spend if you were not like within
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:32.720]   one hours travel time of that of that venue and you flew like six hours to again watch
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.800]   what was a very, very stilted canned presentation with really very it was you're right.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.400]   It was very professionally done.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.440]   There were no trip ups.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.480]   There was no stumbling.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.840]   There was no like pauses as oh, we thought that he
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.600]   would be able to cross from the right left stage to the center stage more quickly than
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.080]   that.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.640]   But on the other hand, it was like watching a video game walkthrough in many ways.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.760]   And that again, it's it's okay because this is just a product demo.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.240]   This is not supposed to be showbiz, but I got it.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.360]   All right, we don't have to go on.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.080]   We got only a two hour show.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.920]   Let me just let me just say one point about that is that as someone who's done a couple
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.760]   of thousand of these, I can tell you that that little like they just walked to the wrong
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.920]   part of the stage, that's like two weeks of meetings.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.520]   And that's why a company once they go into a report, we don't look at enough.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.360]   They're going to probably do it recorded from now on.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.400]   I think there's something lost.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.320]   Let's talk about the I'm going to be grumpy today.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.560]   You did not get to try it on, Michael Sergeant.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.680]   I did not.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.640]   The most that I got to do was walk into a room where there was this sort of center table.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.440]   And there were two headsets on polls.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.600]   This reminds me a lot of when the iPhone came out.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.160]   Yes.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.320]   You couldn't really go near it.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.880]   And you just see this animation playing on the front screen.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   Is this your TikTok or is this?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.520]   No, I know somebody else's TikTok.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.320]   Oh, yeah, I guess it is.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.640]   Yes.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.080]   Oh, it's our TikTok.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.520]   It's our TikTok.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.920]   This is your video from our channel.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.680]   Very, very crowded.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.120]   How many of them did they have there?
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   They had, I believe, well, I guess it's double.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.560]   So it was six around the table.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.560]   And I wonder, you know, they're doing these.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   There's a close up of it.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.320]   They're doing these demos for people yesterday and today,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.960]   I imagine because it's stretched out so far that there are a handful of them.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.280]   There are not only there a handful of them,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.040]   but what is important to understand is that much like the first iPhone
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.440]   where if you push the wrong button, everything fell apart,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.920]   yeah, that is what we are seeing with these headsets, these headsets.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.480]   So people who are doing the demos are saying very well, highly guided.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.280]   Yes.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.520]   There's another part to this, which I should mention,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.440]   which, and I think this is a big problem for it,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.760]   is you have to set it up.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.160]   You have to have your face shot with the device, the Vision Pro,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.280]   but also your ears scanned with your iPhone.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.960]   You have to have your face scanned with the iPhone.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.760]   And right now they don't even have that process fully baked in yet.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.320]   I cannot stress enough how much this is,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.880]   this is why it's coming out next year, is that it's not there yet.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.960]   Right now they're doing it with an iPhone.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.400]   You don't actually do this set up process with the headset itself.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   You do it with an iPhone that then pipes that information into the headset.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.720]   And the lens you learn off was one of the folks who was able to try it
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.600]   and I think did a really good job of detailing the experience a little more
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.040]   than I've seen from some folks.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.680]   They have a special device that people who make lenses for glass.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.160]   Sices makes the lenses, but you have to get your particular prescription.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.400]   Yes, and so they have an optometrist testing machine
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.720]   to figure out what to pop in.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.160]   And they do this all, it's almost like,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.000]   assembly line.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.200]   Assembly line, yes, exactly.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.960]   And so you don't see what's happening behind the scenes.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.040]   Then you go in, it's there for you to put on.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.000]   Another thing is that they didn't show this,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.360]   you don't see this in the videos,
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.400]   you don't see this, I didn't see this in the photos that I was able to capture.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.760]   But there is also a strap that goes over the head to help add support.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.440]   It's interesting that they're not showing that.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.000]   I don't know if that means that eventually they hope they won't have to have that or what,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.960]   if it's an optional strap that's in the eventual box.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   But there's all this stuff that's kind of happening behind the scenes right now.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.600]   The reason I think that's kind of important is because one of the,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.120]   oh, hey, we happen to have one right here.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.800]   Thank you, Anthony, for bringing yours in.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   One of the reasons I think it's important is because one of the use cases
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.400]   might be to have this at an Apple store to let people try it,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   or put it in an IKEA showroom to let people do that thing that Alex Lindsay thinks
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.280]   everybody wants to do, which is a place furniture in their house.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.400]   But if the setup is so lengthy and personalized, by the way, it even has Iris recognition.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   So that it knows it's you when you put it on.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.120]   It is a very personalized device.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.480]   It's not something that you could just have in a mass market situation.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.600]   Yeah, and I think part of the,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.920]   we should say everything I'm saying is about this.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.880]   We don't know what five years or 10 years or 20 years down the road, they'll be.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.160]   But I have to say, as far as I could tell, for reading a whole bunch of stuff and looking a lot
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.920]   of videos, a plus in technological innovation, we'll talk about some of the features, really,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.280]   something only an Apple could do.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.560]   In fact, Meta hasn't done it, HTC hasn't done it, nobody's done this.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:34.240]   One, two, I think in terms of performance of delivering a product that's amazing,
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.200]   they've done A plus.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:42.640]   But I cannot help point out that ergonomically, this is a solid F that people are not looking
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.720]   to strap screens on their faces.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   And so, well, some, what happens when you develop something so cool, it's almost like they made the
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.920]   world's best, I don't know, submersible submarine. And it's like, oh, this is amazing.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.120]   But it's just not a, it's not something people are looking for. You disagree, Andy?
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.720]   Well, I wouldn't say it's an F. I mean, the thing is the ergonomics are not good.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.960]   My overall take on this is that this is not the machine that Apple wanted to show off.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   This is the, they just got impatient and they stopped waiting for the display technology to
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.080]   become small enough, compact enough to do what they wanted to do to make the device they wanted
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.760]   to make. So they decided we're going to make something that is a very conventional looking
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.120]   familiar device will be familiar to people who have been using VR headsets for the past five or
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.560]   six years. And we will simply move on from there after demonstrating that we know how to run these
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.360]   displays. We know how to get enough detail that you can retext pretty much at any size,
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.840]   no matter where you put the window in the virtual space, that lag is not going to be a problem.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   And that as far as comfort goes, it's going to be as comfortable as such a device can possibly be.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.120]   I do notice they never mentioned the weight. They never mentioned the fans.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.720]   That's the, well, okay. But the people, okay, the people getting back to look,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.040]   I, we, Mark has Bradley said it was very heavy.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.320]   Yeah, he's got a, most of these got a pretty strong neck.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.200]   Yeah. Yeah. One other thing. Most of the, most of the people that I read who got the demos,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.440]   A, they said that the setup was actually very, very quick for, for what it was doing. It wasn't
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.920]   like very, very cumbersome. They also mentioned specifically that one of the things that Apple
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.480]   was admitting to was that they were still working on that interface between the device and your head.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.440]   They had a limited number of sizes available to make sure that things fit correctly to people's
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.480]   heads, but they were working on by ship date, having so many of these different variations.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.160]   Yeah. One of the things you'll do is have your face scan and they will custom mold
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.600]   a front piece for you. Yeah. So, and that's another reason you're going to not going to see
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.680]   these in a mass market situation. And the other thing is regarding the fan that most of the people
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   I've, that again, that I've been reading and the one person I talked to said that you really
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.560]   couldn't hear the fan. So, okay, that's fine. It's, it's good they have a fan because otherwise,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.520]   I wouldn't say it's F compared to what it's your, but you are, you do have it right on the
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.920]   money. We've been talking about this for a long time that this is still, I mean, in general,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.760]   VR, I'm joking, I'm joking about this, but I mean, he's going on his view master to put this,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.960]   yeah, to put on this, this, you know, on a way, big ski goggle thing is a really big thing. And
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.760]   I think it was kind, it's kind of adorable that they came up with like the iView saying,
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.800]   maybe it'll be okay if we have a scre, a lenticular screen that will make people be able to see your
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.440]   eyes behind it. Well, there's another how desperate they are. Totally dystopian and weird saying
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:43.040]   they showed a father taping a video tape, a 3D stereoscopic tape of his kid blowing out the candles.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   Yeah, that's great, except all I'm seeing as a kid is creepy eye dad.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:54.640]   Everyone, everyone I'd spoke to did not, no one that I spoke to had a positive reaction to that
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.440]   idea of having to wear it. What you capture. I think we don't live in a world where we want to
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:05.680]   distance ourselves more from people. We go to movies not, we look, I have a credible movie
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.240]   theater in my house. If I want to go to the movies, it's because there's other people there. So
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.960]   I think this is, this is to me from an ergonomic and a psychological point of view, this is the
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.280]   wrong direction. Now, we've all said, you know, someday they're going to make these as spectacles
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.480]   that'll just, you know, sit lightly on your nose and you'll have augmented reality. Show me
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.360]   those then I'll give it an A plus on ergonomics. But I don't even think the technology to make that
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.320]   exists. So Apple is doing a lot of hand waving here for something that I don't, I think is dead on
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.320]   a rival. Personally, dead on a rival. Oh, wow. They'll sell a million next year.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.400]   Yeah, that's fine. It's still dead on a rival.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.000]   And by the way, I don't think they're making a lot of money. People were
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.080]   creeped out about $3,500. That's probably pretty close to the bill of materials. I mean, it's
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.720]   probably, you know, it's, it's, you can't the problem that everybody else has now. If they
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.440]   think, if they disagree with you and decide that that they want goggles, they want to make them.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:13.280]   The problem is Apple has locked up so many patents along with something built along with building
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.960]   something that is so self-contained. It will be hard at any price for anyone to put out any
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.360]   piece of device that's going to really compete as heavily with that right now. The biggest problem
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.280]   that HTC and Facebook had is and Google had was a constant discussion about price, which Apple
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.480]   stopped talking about. Apple was just like, I mean, that isn't the highest end headset that I've
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.920]   seen, but it's the highest publicly available one or will be. And the ones that I saw that were,
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.920]   that were nicer than this were a quarter million dollars each.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:48.400]   So I'm going to point out that the Microsoft Connect, which is the fastest selling consumer
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.960]   product of all time at that time, you probably don't even remember it.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.320]   Yes, I sold 35 million units and is gone and was considered a massive failure. A lot of technology
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:07.520]   went into that thing. That sold 35 million and was considered a failure. I just, I don't think
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.720]   this is a million big deal. I think it'll be, I think the first couple of years, it'll probably be,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.280]   you know, somewhere in the sub 5 million range. A million is going to be the basement. I think
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.160]   I don't, I think that 5 million is probably. Well, I could sell 35 million and still be a failure.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.200]   Of course, it's a lot more expensive than the Connect was. A lot more expensive than Connect
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.440]   was. So that's why it's not going to sell 35 million. I might add. And I don't remember what
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.040]   the numbers are for the watch, but they weren't very big in the first year. This is not the watch.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.960]   This is not the watch. The watch was relatively much, you know, a tenth the cost
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.480]   and was an accessory that you could wear that had some utility right out of the box. It was a watch.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:49.520]   Yeah. Is the bigger question here? Not does Apple need this to be the first big success
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.200]   in this idea of spatial computing. Can we not have a second generation that is the vision without
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.360]   the pro that I think you're still probably three or four years away from a consumer,
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.600]   a model that's less expensive than this one. So this is the stop and right, but it's not a stop
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.840]   gap. I don't think it was a stop gap. I think it is another step in the, in something they were
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.120]   building from the beginning. So the thing is, is that there's no, I think that they,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.920]   no, it's not a stop gap. It's a step because it's not, they're not saying, oh, we couldn't get to
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.720]   what we wanted to. I think that they were, they've been building a systematic process. This is part
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.480]   of that systematic process. I don't think they got impatient a couple years ago. I think that they
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.320]   probably had this largely figured out five, four or five years ago, you know, in that as a headset
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.920]   of this is what the first one's going to be. And then the next one will be much more transparent
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.400]   and the next one will be much more. I mean, Apple is oftentimes working at 10 years in advance.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.600]   You know, and so the thing is, is that I don't think that this is, if they got impatient,
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.920]   it was in 2017 or 2018 or 2016, it wasn't last year or two years ago. And so the thing is, is that they,
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:56.400]   so they, I think that they, the problem is, is that you can't build the set, the headset that you
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.520]   want without people interacting with the headset that you can make today. So while you can, while
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.440]   you can understand that talk about that. And what happened is all the other headsets have been
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.240]   dumbed down because of price, like even the, even the, even the, even the Facebook one,
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.880]   those $1,500, which gave them more headroom, price has been devastating to these devices because
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.040]   they just require so much technology to be fluid. And so Apple's making it more expensive.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.560]   They're allowing themselves to figure that out.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.440]   The technology's in there that probably costs them, you know, close to that, to put 7,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.280]   11 cameras and 7. It's incredible. It's an incredible, I understand that.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.360]   I'm not, you know, they had to cost that much effect. Harry McCracken pointed out that the Apple
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:46.160]   one, which cost $666 in its day in 1976 dollars would have cost $3,554 today. So it's $54 cheaper
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.960]   in real dollars than the, and I got my Apple two, my Apple two, and today's prices was over $5,000.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.080]   I just say that those things were much more useful immediately.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.880]   This is, this is not, you know, and no one wants, I hate to tell you, Alex, I know you love it,
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.040]   and there are people who love it. No one wants to put screens on their face. It's a horrible
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.240]   experience. Well, not, not, not yet. I just, I, I do just, I do think that this is the best
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.600]   that they could do right now. They had to have a first one of these so great, eventually,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.720]   that's all nice to Craigie Island covered in Bert Guano. Congratulations. You own it, but this,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.200]   and this, this would be, this would be a very, very weird choice for meta to have done for Apple.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.000]   If they have the money, you simply say, yeah, exactly. I think that they have the ability to
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.360]   launch a product like this without any real expectations. That's going to be a success in any way other
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.560]   than it works. This, what they have to, what I think that what their priority is, if they have
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.600]   to sell the idea that this is going to be so the 4K display that you're going to have off of your
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.720]   Mac is so good that it's going to be the equivalent of a real display for you. When you have app
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.520]   windows floating in front of you in front of environment, that's going to be so easy to use as
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.880]   a display that you're going to be able to use it. They have to, they just have, and they have to
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   prove the idea that this is not just for training people in how to, how to, how to maintain an
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.960]   aircraft engine in the military. This is not just about gaming that this is going to be a
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.520]   computing platform. So I think that their idea is that so long as they develop a first generation
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.960]   of hardware that can sell that, that idea that this is a platform for apps, not just a way to look
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.360]   at magic dinosaurs jumping up and down on the desk in front of you, they will consider that a win
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.040]   for the next, for the next generation to come. Yeah. And I think that one of the big things is that
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.120]   while everybody else had to figure out how to build all those things, Apple is making a lot
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.960]   of the apps that already exist to simply work in there. And so being able to, you're not
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.480]   leaving this to use something else, which is a big hill that everybody else had to clean,
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.000]   to climb is like, what do we do? And how do we get people to put it on? Well, there's just a ton
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.840]   of things that you can just go ahead and do in there. And so, and you know, I think a lot of that.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.360]   Yeah, that's by the way, you say it that way. I'd say it's a nice lock in Apple. This does not
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.080]   work if you are not. Do you have to own an iPhone to use it? I know it's a standalone computer, but
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:01.920]   probably it's not really going to be aimed at it. No, but I buy it. Do I need a Mac? Fine. I get
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:07.680]   an iPad too. Let's just buy everything. It's very good. It's a very good ecosystem play for Apple.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.440]   Congratulations. And the reason they could do that, Alex, is because it's basically,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.920]   you know, iPad, OS, I'm sure it's running a mock current. It's very similar. I think
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.200]   iPad OS, I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, they're at the platform state of the union yesterday,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.920]   they were running through like, what it will be like to take an iPad app and modify it so that
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.080]   it will work on Vision OS. Again, assuming that you just don't want to just have it
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.760]   just be an iPad window that's floating in front of you. And really, it's you drag something new into
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.840]   your Xcode. And then you simply decide, here's your Swift view of your current app. Do you want
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.960]   to hang things off the bottom of it? Do you want to have certain things in it? Would you want to
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.360]   add three dimensional elements to it? If that's really all you want to do with it, you can basically
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.400]   promote it to being a Vision OS app very, very quickly. And of course, they want people to be
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:04.160]   more ambitious than that. And I will also say, as an aside, that if all it does is, hey, look,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.840]   I can have virtual screens all around me. That's not terribly ambitious. And I hope that they crack
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.680]   the idea of 3D computing and 3D spatial computing is something more than I can instead of having
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.480]   to instead of having a next day, a $320 new monitor, have a fourth or fifth or fifth screen
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.120]   on my desktop, I can just drag a window up there. It has to be better than that. And I don't think
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.840]   they really made that case yesterday. But again, it's bought the ecosystem about being able to take
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:35.120]   the app that you created, make amendments to it and turn it into an actual Vision OS app that has
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.360]   shadows that reacts to the light that's around you, that when people enter the room that your app
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.440]   will fade into the background so that person can get the focus, all these things you get for free.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.920]   That's a very, very powerful mojo for a developer.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:54.080]   So I think really that it is important to understand that there's this is next year,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   which by the way, must have surprised a few people. This is not this year. This is next year.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:06.400]   And that could early next year could be June, could be a year out. So, well, let's say May 31st.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.080]   But the audience for this is obviously it's not us. It's not, it's not, maybe us, but it's not
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:22.800]   consumers. It's developers. That's obvious. Now, did they give any indication when developers might
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:29.280]   get the first developers? I think that's one of the opportunity to try it on last night.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.160]   No, no, I mean to actually develop. That was where I was going.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:39.920]   They said, oh, sorry. And at the event, Apple announced that they would be releasing VisionKit
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.360]   within, was it the first month, within next month? A couple of months from now.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.720]   Thank you. And there's, and there's a virtual reality. There's basically a virtual environment
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.960]   inside of Xcode so that if you're testing out this thing without having the hardware,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:01.760]   you basically have like a 3D first person shooter look at this fake room that they've developed
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.040]   inside of Xcode to test it out. And so, yeah, you can get going in about two months.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.720]   Looks like. So that's really who, I mean, that's really the real question.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.920]   The only question that matters is will people develop for it? I know you will, Alex.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.280]   And that's, I think that there's, go ahead Alex.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.920]   But what is the calculation a developer has to make? They have to say, well,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:27.760]   do I have the skills? Do I have a product that would fit this category? And finally,
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.520]   is there going to be a market for this a year or more out?
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.440]   As a small developer, that's a hard conversation to have,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.000]   is because it's a lot of investment with not a large market. As a large developer,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.880]   I mean, I've been doing immersive media for 30 years now. So we've been building these things
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.920]   for a long time. And one of the things that's required to make this work is to do a lot of it.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:55.200]   So you can't, you can't, you just can't think about how to make it work or how it should interact
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.240]   until you've done it. And so for a lot of the larger developers and gaming developers and
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   infrastructural developers that want to get into this, they're going to build a small division that
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.720]   just, you know, if it doesn't work out, they'll reorganized those three or four people. But there's
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.000]   going to be three, four, five, 10 people in a lot of Fortune 100 companies that are figuring out
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.760]   what the next thing is, you know, and trying to make sure that they're not caught behind,
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   because it's not something you can, it is very complicated and not something you can come up
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.640]   to speed really quickly with. Yeah. Well, again, if you're not very ambitious, you can make a,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.320]   this is what bothers me. You could do it Disney plus promise, which
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.480]   put Disney plus on it sure. It's like, hey, great, you can watch 3D movies and it looks awesome.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.640]   Hey, great. Again, you can have virtual monitors for your iPad apps. But if it's, it really has to be
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.160]   more than that, I think to be considered a cultural success. At 4K per eye, just to be clear, at 4K
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.480]   per eye at the, at the frame rates that it's going to run at, which looks to be approximately 83 frames a
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.800]   second. How did you get that number? That's good to know, because they did not say that the R1 chip.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.920]   Yeah, they said the R1 chip pulls it every at 12 milliseconds. Oh, perfect. They did say the
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.200]   latency was 12 milliseconds. Yeah. Yeah. So that's about 83 frames a second. And so, so the, so,
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.840]   if you, what that means is that it's not just that you can watch Avatar on your headset,
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.960]   it's that it will look at least as good as it did in the theater.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:24.480]   Like that's curious. Because Avatar is not stereoscopic. Or is it?
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.800]   Yeah. Avatar, Avatar and Avatar 2 are both stereoscopic. They're designed to be two eyes.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.840]   Oh, I guess you were goggles with them. And so when they showed it in iMacs, they use iMacs.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:42.160]   You use them. Okay. Yeah, use the goggles. And so, so are many movies stereoscopic? Is that?
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.520]   There will be. I mean, the problem is, is that, I mean, there's a lot of them that are done.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   Not very many of them are done well. So the Hobbit, the Avatar.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.080]   Yes, sir. I think Kev was saying yesterday that for the Chinese market,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.880]   because the Chinese are still very excited about 3D movies.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.240]   Most movies now are at least upconverted to 3D.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.560]   And the problem is the upconversion just, the upconversion won't be that great. But the,
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.960]   there's lots and lots of movies that are upconverted, because that was a thing for a while. After Avatar
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.800]   came out, everybody built, you know, for all of us, I literally sent out an email this morning to a
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.680]   friend of mine who's got a couple 3D cameras and like, hey, you might want to rebuild those.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.040]   Yes, you might want to build those, get them put back together. He's got them sitting in pieces.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.840]   And, but the, the issue is, is that there's a, there's a bunch of things that'll be interesting
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.640]   in the, in that development area. Like, for instance, it'd be really convenient to be able to show sports
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:39.360]   live. And, but it's really hard to get the rights to that. If only they had a soccer or football or,
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.480]   or something that they could shoot in stereo that they could put into that. Oh, wait, wait. So,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.280]   so the MLS becomes a lot more, makes a lot more sense now.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.400]   How hard is it now that so Michael found the things that the SDK is available later this month.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.080]   How hard is it to develop this though without the hardware? I mean,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.320]   you can do a lot of it. I want to say this is where I feel there might be in these early days,
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.960]   Apple very much positioned both on stage and in, you know, the first introduction to developers,
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:15.040]   the idea that even more whenever we saw apps from iPhone and iPad make their way to the Mac,
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.640]   even more so, I don't think they're, that developers necessarily, I think the first question they ask,
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.000]   you talked about the questions they should ask themselves. The first question they ask is,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.480]   do I need to do any development for VisionOS? Because so many developers can take the apps they
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.360]   already have and just have them as part of a spaces workspace where it is just that
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.560]   slack that they don't need to be used to the volumes and spaces. Go ahead.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.320]   To your point, there's a lot of stuff that will be available to the user immediately without any
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.560]   special development. But there is a lot of opportunity to build out a, you know, something that is
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.400]   really taking advantage of the platform and that's, and those are the things that end up at the top
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.560]   of the store, you know, I mean, like that's, you know, like, you can, you can port your thing over,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.400]   but what's going to end up in the VR in the, in the, or the, the Vision Store at the front page,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.800]   and we should, even when it's small, it's a lot of people willing to spend money on it because they
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:12.000]   have, this is the only place they can go buy that stuff. When you do something, you know, like
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.040]   Elements was not the most, the greatest app in the world ever made to talk about the, the
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.720]   Elements, but when it came out for the iPad, everybody I knew bought it, because we were just
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.560]   like, it's $15 and we all paid for it and we all wanted to see what they were doing in 3D and
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.160]   everything else. That's going to be another opportunity for them to go back and grab that,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.040]   that data. Again, sports, you're probably going to see it by just Apple's probably going to dump
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.520]   a lot of money into the market. I was the beneficiary of Google and Facebook doing that.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   So there's going to be a lot of, of people that are pushing, they're going to spend a lot of money
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.400]   into that market to, to energize it and to prove and show models. And so, so I think that there's a
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.320]   lot, there's a lot that's going to be there. I do not doubt that Apple will pour billions of
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.800]   literally, literal billions. For the next five years, for people who are marketing and creating
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.600]   content and all sorts of stuff. Yeah. No, and that's, you know, if you're going to say there is
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.480]   something in the, in the Vision Pro's favor, it's that Apple is clearly all in on this thing. I
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.360]   mean, they must have spent 10 billion, well, I mean, a year, right? That's what Metas spent.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   Probably that's what Metas spent. So they must have spent 10 billion dollars for the last decade.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.760]   That's a lot of money on this thing. And I expect they will continue spending
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.440]   significant amounts of money into the future. Yeah. And I think that their reputation is a
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.440]   reputational risk because they're, you know, if it's not a success, people are going to look at Tim Cook.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:41.760]   So they need, they needed to succeed. I just, I think that there's this fundamental thing that
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:50.960]   everybody seems to ignore. People do not want to strap. I mean, I think 70% of the population
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   probably doesn't want to strap anything on their face. I think it's probably 70%, 75%. But 30%
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.600]   of the population is still a lot of people. You know, like, you know, and so that's.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.240]   So this will be something for the 30%. This is, yeah, and that will be enough of a market.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.600]   It's certainly going to be a financially enough of a market for Apple. Apple doesn't have more
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.560]   than 30% of the smartphone market globally, but they have much more than the lion's share
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.880]   of profit. So they can make money on it. I'm not saying they can't. I just, I don't think this
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.240]   is going to change the world. And the only reason I'm being so negative is because, and I knew this
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.640]   would happen, you're going to see every pundit in the world swooning over this thing, especially
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:34.320]   people have tried it on. And there is something to swoon about this is, and we're going to take
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.560]   a break and then come back and talk about the technology because it's really, this is Apple
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.120]   operating on all eight cylinders. I mean, they've created something technologically amazing.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:50.800]   I think it's worth pointing out that this is a yet to be demonstrated market.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.760]   Yeah. Yeah. And for me, the thing that really, really sticks to my craw is that
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:03.120]   the iPhone is a small percentage of the mobile market, but the market for people who actually own
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.040]   smartphones is phenomenal. It's getting close to 100.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.440]   And they created that part. If you had teacher phone, yeah. No, no, that that was a long, long
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.680]   process. I wouldn't agree with that. But what I'm saying is what I'm saying is that the development
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.520]   of the phone was such that they're so commoditized and they're so useful and so relevant to daily life
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.560]   that if you are at the lowest income level, the United States government will buy you a phone and
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.760]   set you up with a data plan. That's right. Just to make sure that just to make sure that you
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.440]   have an email address, just making access to government services, that sort of thing.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.520]   If this platform, I'm not just limiting this to to to Apple, if this platform is for people who
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   could shell out a thousand bucks for this kind of a headset, and that's that's not the that's not
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.480]   the aspirational level of technology for the people who for the people who have the money to spend on
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.960]   something that may or may not be actually useful. And you and Leo, you had one of the one of the
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.080]   most important points that everyone is who got the demo today and yesterday has been swooning
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.520]   about Avatar two watching through this headset. But watching, would you rather watch
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:13.040]   watch Avatar two and 3D through this 3,500 heads dollar headset alone, or would you rather watch
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:19.520]   it on the sofa with your spouse and your two children on a $400 TV 4K TV set? Watching it as
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.960]   a group together without having to buy everybody on a thousand dollar headset is absolutely the
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.360]   more the more enjoyable way to watch a movie. I think I think that's going to be true for a long
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:37.120]   time that the 30% who buy and wear this thing are going to be outcasts. It's good. And they're not
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.680]   going to don't invite them to the world. They will be nice to the will be nice to call them the
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:48.240]   spooky eyed set. All right, they have the money to do they have the money to retribute against us
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.960]   like no, let's be nice to them. It's they don't have us killed or something have have their Tesla
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.440]   robots just like wack us in the knee or something. Yeah, I mean, that's the fundamental thing. This
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:06.800]   is a single emphatically single user device that gives you some benefit over what we have today,
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:14.880]   but not massively so. They'll develop it. Yeah, not yet. Yeah, it's I think they'll be I don't
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.960]   think it's much smaller percentage of that 30% but a small percentage of people will probably
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.720]   spend most of the day in it like they'll probably get those people will have a psychological damage.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.800]   Can not be cannot be downplay. It's funny because Michael, I mean, Apple at the same time as they
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.280]   introduced this introduced a new feature in watchOS that tells you to go outside and get some sun.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:43.200]   So I don't know if that's a good thing to be. Well, I mean, I don't know.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.760]   Things are good for us. The first thing. Right. And they haven't. This is even worse.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.480]   I mean, I mean, phones and for both our physical eyes as well as our, you know, there's definitely
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.080]   problematic problems with the process. I'm not saying that there isn't, but I'm still saying
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.000]   it's going to be a big deal. Like it's going to be a platform. Well, it's a big deal now. Yeah.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.160]   It's going to be it's going to I think that over the years as they become much, there's going to be a
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.400]   high performance version that keeps on staying at $3,500 and keeps on getting better might even go up
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.200]   to more money and be even better than what we see here. There's going to be a less expensive
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.320]   version that's going to, you know, they're going to have less and less expensive versions like they've
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.080]   done with every other product that they've made is they've made one that they could do at the
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   price that they sell at sold out, then they go upwards and downwards, you know, from from that.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.960]   So we can probably expect five years from now to have one that's $800 and one that's $8,000.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.400]   You know, like that's that's probably the direction Apple will take it.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.000]   And I should point out the the vast success of smartphones are sub $50.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.240]   By by by total sales, but Apple Apple has a much larger percentage of the profit.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.880]   Like profit wise. If what you're looking at profit, maybe you're,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   although if you spend in 10 billion a year, 20 years, those companies think about a lot of
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.600]   money on makeup for that. Well, a million a year is still three billion dollars a year.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.920]   They're they're lost on including. That means you've only lost seven billion that year.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.680]   Well, I mean, it's again, it's not that Apple can't afford to. Right. I mean, only Apple could do
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.360]   this. And I think that's the thing that's of interest. People are getting mad at me now in the
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:18.160]   chat room saying, why are you so negative? I'll stop. But you'll you'll see you young people in a year
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.720]   and you'll be hey, here's the good news. In two years, you'll be able to buy this for $35.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:33.040]   You know, the the advantage that Apple has is that number one is that what it took to do this was
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.800]   an incredible investment that almost no other company can do this. Yes.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.000]   Number two is that they have the skill set to do hardware at this level that almost nobody else
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.680]   has. Number three, I'm not nobody, but almost nobody, especially at that tolerance level.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.840]   Number three is that they have an entire ecosystem that they're setting up that they've already set
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.400]   up for the last five or six years that's tied into the hardware to many, many pieces of hardware,
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.680]   your app, AirPods, everything else is all tied into this experience. And nobody else has that
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.880]   entire thing. And what Apple has been slowly doing over the last couple years is playing,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.640]   starting to play games. And this is this is a this is the biggest and I've said this, I don't
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.280]   know for the last five years that Apple's number one problem is antitrust because they've taken what
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:24.000]   they're the size and ability that they have. And they are they're basically playing games that
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.680]   no one else can play. That's a good point. We're gonna we're gonna play a game like the M1
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.200]   chips. And it's an argument for letting Apple get big, right? Or letting a company get big because
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.040]   only they could do these kinds of moonshots. I mean, there is no other company, but the problem for
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.520]   the rest of the industry is like you can't there's no real answer to the M1 chips because you can't
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.960]   really get everybody to agree. You know, like Apple owns everything that's required to make that work.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   And being a vertical system is almost impossible to do. And you should never try to do it by yourself
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.440]   if you're a little company. Because that's that's almost that's almost so. Once you get over to the
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.160]   other side, you have no competition. You have like there they have no competition in there and
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.880]   true competition and where they're going. And so there is a big question mark that because
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.800]   can you make this at a consumer price? And if you do, what do you take out? I mean, what we're
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.720]   seeing is the Cadillac. This is the thing with everything. What do you what it's not like?
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.560]   I would say that this is a nice Honda like the where they're going to go with it. Oh, yeah.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.040]   Okay. Oh, you this is a this is a right now. They need a technology now if they're going to turn
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.960]   it right away. Spectacles. They need technology that don't exist right now.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.280]   Everyone's driving around little you goes right now and Apple brought in a Honda.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.200]   They've got you know, there's the Ferrari is still out there and getting down to the
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.880]   you go will be hard for their Honda to for them to figure out. It's going to be much harder for them
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.360]   to go downstream than upstream, you know, as far as what the feature sets and the quality.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.560]   You can get a used Honda for 3500 bucks. I just want to point out.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   But very early one. So it's very very you get a 90 you get a 2000 on the pretty
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:04.720]   little you know, little could be. Yeah. You know, six but but I but I think that it so I think that
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.360]   that the the real difficulty everybody else has is that once you put these on, it's you know,
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.440]   the the other headsets are going to look like you goes right and you're going to
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.120]   you're going to have to have already done that. I mean, they think they probably already done
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:25.440]   that the Oculus the pro is which was 1500 bucks is now down to 1000 is nothing compared to this.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.080]   It's right. And that's the problem is. And so people the problem is is the people will will
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.960]   you know, they're they're going to have a hard time if they try the headset on.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.400]   But the issue is is that they're going to have a hard time going back to the other headsets.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.160]   Like that's going to be the thing that that is going to be difficult is that they're going to
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.120]   have a hard time. We'll start budgeting it again because you're going to save up
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.400]   any because I've got a giant. But what I say is that people will decide they can't afford that
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.600]   headset, but they're not going to say I can't afford that headset. So I'm going to buy the
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   Facebook headset. They're going to the meta headset. They're going to say I can't afford that.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.200]   And I'm just not going to use headsets like that. It's it's going to be it's that much
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.440]   different than the other ones that are there. That's the problem. Unless unless the one that
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.160]   meta or another competitor basically treats the like we were talking about last week,
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   they could this could be the Newton message pad. Apple Apple does again,
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.720]   where they create this beautiful kind of aspirational really expensive thing. And then
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.960]   then another company says, Hey, that's great. But what if it could fit in a shirt pocket? What
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.040]   if it cost half as much? And what if anybody could write software for it without having
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   this pay of fortune for development kit? And then that's the platform that takes off for us.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:36.320]   Newton is credible and wonderful and a high level kind of funny that we are complaining that you
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.200]   have to sign up for a Facebook account to use the oculative. When you're almost certainly going to
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.280]   have to have an apple account and register your irises and give them your firstborn.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.680]   So we have a different we have a different privacy relationship with Facebook. We do.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.960]   But that's a good problem. Yeah, I didn't in fact, I really didn't want to create a meta account.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.360]   But I obviously have many connections to Apple. Anyway, I'm going to stop harshing people's
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.040]   mellow. I know you all want to live in the future. And you know, here I am sitting here in the mud
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:12.160]   saying we're never getting to the stars. But we will talk about what is quite impressive in
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:19.680]   terms of technology. And by the way, the Mac Pro was announced for incidentally,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.800]   and the 15 inch MacBook Air, which is probably the only thing everybody's going to buy. I bought
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:31.120]   one. We'll talk about that. And by the way, a thousand bucks less than a vision. And also
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:37.600]   available to order now available now. So there you go. And useful and use and arguably useful.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:44.160]   Yes. Our show today brought to you by thank you, anybody putting up with my cranky crankiness.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:51.280]   I'll come down. Our show today brought to you by ACI learning. Oh man, I want to thank them.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.520]   They are sponsored our coverage yesterday of the Apple event of the Microsoft events
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.040]   the week before the build keynotes. They sponsor the studios. They've really been
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.920]   very good to us. Thank you, ACI learning. And one of the reasons is because of our long
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.600]   relationship with IT Pro. Wait a minute, you say don't they compete with IT Pro? No, they are IT
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:18.000]   Pro. They've merged. IT Pro has been our trusted sponsor for the last decade. And they, as you
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.800]   probably know, most of us have experienced it providing engaging, entertaining, IT training
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:30.960]   to every one of our listeners. As part of the ACI learning family, IT Pro's capabilities
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:38.160]   will continue to impressively grow now even more so highly entertaining, bingeable,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.760]   short form content about 20 to 30 minutes, full transcriptions. You can watch them make it that
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:49.040]   the studios are open Monday through Friday, nine to five. And you can go in that just like you
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:54.480]   watch us live, you can go watch them live, be in the chatroom with them live. They have 7,000
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:59.520]   hours of on demand content. And the reason those studios are running all day every day is because
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:05.840]   everything changes, the test change, the search change, software changes, there's new software.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   So they keep up and that's the nice thing. You're getting the freshest content possible.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:15.440]   30% of ACI learners are MSPs. Now I thought that was really interesting. I found that out the other
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:20.560]   day that managed service providers. That's what that's what we use. We don't have a full time IT
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:28.560]   staff. We have Russell and his team. He's an MSP. And ACI learning is great for MSPs. The MSPs
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:34.400]   love the practice labs that ACI learning offers. They test and experiment before deploying new
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   apps or updates without compromising their production systems, which is really nice because
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:46.320]   all you need is an HTML5 browser. You didn't do it on a Chromebook or iOS device if you want
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.640]   to. And then run instances of Windows Server and desktop clients. And I always say it because I
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.920]   mean it because I did it. If you'd make a mistake, you just close the tab and you're back to square.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:04.080]   It's okay. You didn't harm anybody. They also have, I love this practice exam. So you can prepare
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.280]   for your certification examinations by taking the test before you take the test. That is the
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.520]   best way, I think, to get people used to the test format, how it's going to be. You can get the
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.160]   knowledge, but having the experience of taking the test ahead of time really makes a difference.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:24.640]   One happy MSP team leader said, and I quote, "I had 110 engineers in the field. We had dozens of
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:33.360]   IT pro accounts last year alone. They passed over 40 certs. Whatever your business, whatever your IT
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.480]   team, you know you need to keep them up to date. It's a benefit that keeps them employed. And by
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:45.200]   the way, keeping an employee is a high priority these days. Plus, they love learning more and they
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:52.400]   will benefit you because your company, your business, your MSP will be more secure, more effective.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:52:01.200]   ACI learning. You know how I know the people love ACI training? The average view dropout rate
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.520]   on most training videos, about 70%, only 30% make it through to the end of the video.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.040]   With ACI learning 80% make it through the end of the video because the videos are compelling,
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:21.120]   they're entertaining, and even more importantly, they're valuable. You're getting what you need
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:28.000]   from them. So don't settle for subpar training. You can use ACI's pro portal to assign courses,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.680]   upskill your MSPs, manage seats, assign and unassign team members. You get great graphical,
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:40.640]   you know, views of how it's going. Retain top talent, upskill your team
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:47.360]   with IT pro training from ACI learning. ACI learning courses are easy to navigate,
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.000]   so much more straightforward, the traditional training programs, and they fit your
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.120]   style and your needs. And by the way, ISO certified. You're getting the world class training,
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:02.320]   your team deserves. As that of the other guys, right now as an individual, you get 30% off.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:07.040]   If you use the offer code TWIT 30, that's for a standard or premium individual IT pro membership.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.400]   Don't worry, great discounts for group learning for teams from two to a thousand,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:18.560]   the volume discounts started at five seats across audit, IT and cybersecurity readiness.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:25.120]   ACI learning has premium training options waiting for you. Go.acilearning.com/twitgo.

[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.280]   That's enough to complete everything you need for a search. Actually, if you work hard at it,
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   go.acilearning.com/twit. Thank you, ACI learning. We appreciate your support.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:50.960]   I've really been impressed reading through, you know, of course, we saw, you know, half hour video,
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:56.800]   but reading through later the articles, Lances article and tech radar,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.960]   Marques Brownlee's video about the technology really, that's what most oppresses me. This is,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:11.760]   it strikes me as a plus technology. 4K screens, they said postage stamp sized.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.000]   Is that that seems smaller? Large postage stamps, I think.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.760]   OK, a big postage stamp. Plus, if you need correction, if you wear glasses,
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.120]   Zeiss lenses that are magnetically fitted in, I think that's cool.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.800]   I'm sure that those will be really discounted and not very expensive to add to your.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.080]   Yeah, well, you already spent $3,500, was another 500 bucks.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.720]   500 bucks. That's what I did, I did it for even four.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.720]   Yeah, it could wear your contacts if you want, but I think you'd want to wear those lenses.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.360]   It's a FOVI. This is really cool. I was hoping they would do this. The rumors were they would
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.160]   do this. This is a FOVI. display. Alex, you better explain what that is.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.240]   FOVI.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.040]   A FOVI.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:56.400]   What it does is it's looking at, there's basically static or dynamic. A static FOVI.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.320]   Render is going to be a render that assumes that you're not going to look to the sides.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:06.160]   So it's going to focus all of the resolution, possibly frame rate, all into the center of the
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.400]   or the center of where it thinks you're looking at. What Apple appears to have is a dynamic
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.920]   FOVI. Render and that dynamic FOVI. Render follows your eyes. So it's literally watching your eyes,
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.440]   moving around the screen and where the center of your focus is, which is actually a pretty small area
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:26.960]   of focus. It is making sure that you get all the resolution that you can possibly, that you need
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:32.000]   or that it can provide there. And then as you move away into your periphery, it starts to lower
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.120]   that resolution and potentially even frame rate away. So mostly resolution most likely in that
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.720]   in that area. And so by doing that, it allows it to take limited resources. Obviously,
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.640]   we had unlimited resources. We would not use a FOVIated Render. We would just make everything
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:52.400]   really sharp. By having a FOVIated Render, what we're able to do is have just the resolution that
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.360]   you need at any given moment. And it appears that Apple has done this very well. If you don't do it
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.760]   well, you see it as you move your eyes quickly. Yeah, it would be weird. Start to see edges and so
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.280]   on and so forth. But in this case, it sounds like they've done a pretty good job of it.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:10.240]   And that means that that's part of what allows them to have such a high resolution for those is
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.600]   that the resolution of the screens is that high. But how many bits it's actually sending to those
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.400]   screens at any given time is much lower, which takes a lot of weight off of the processors.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:27.440]   These are micro. By the way, I think FOVIated Render might help with the comfort as well.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:33.520]   I suspect and maybe even with nausea, because it's going to give you the sense of peripheral
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:39.280]   vision, right? Much more than anything. The thing with nausea is primarily frame rate.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.800]   So that is the thing that a lot of people have on a lot of R&D. So 12 milliseconds are about 83
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.640]   frames a second. But that's where most people have an issue is in there's two things that can
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:57.200]   cause nausea. One is that your inner ear and your basically, basically most nausea is related to
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.800]   your inner ears feeling something that your eyes aren't seeing. That's what happens with C-signus.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:06.720]   It's that your eyes aren't seeing it because for a million years before we did all this other stuff,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.480]   if your eyes were seeing something different than your inner ear, you had been poisoned by
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.320]   something you just ate and you need to get it all out of the system as fast as possible.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.120]   And so we had a natural people who survived had a natural reaction to throw up when they did that.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:28.720]   So what happens with low frame rate is that you, the thing that happens with low frame rate is that
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.080]   your eyes are behind, which is another... It's lanky.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:32.720]   And so...
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.840]   So what we found... No head turns and then the picture turns and then your body settle.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.080]   And it can be very subtle.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:38.880]   There's something wrong here.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:45.520]   And it's very subtle. Disney did a bunch of research on this in the 90s and with big
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.680]   onyx boxes and everything else. And they would turn the frame rate up and down to see for rides.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:58.640]   When do you blow chunks? And it was between 12 and 18, depending on the person about 12 to 18.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.680]   At 12 frames a second, no one could hold it.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.640]   There's also...
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.600]   There's also...
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:09.840]   And so the issue of the difference between the focal length that your eyes are saying
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.680]   by triangulation versus your actual focus distance.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.840]   And those are not gonna match because the screens are close, but the objects look...
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.280]   But the apparent...
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.360]   The apparent... What it appears for you is important in that area.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.600]   Because the reality is when you're looking through glasses, you're looking through something like that.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.480]   You're looking at something that's right in front of you that is sharpening what's out there.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.200]   So it's where we're focused too in that area.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.840]   But the issue is that the frame rate as well as the other thing that matters a lot,
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.320]   and this is where they're gonna have trouble with 3D movies,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:54.160]   is that if you change the orientation of the camera a lot, or even a fair bit in 3D,
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:00.640]   you'll get sick. Because we used to do this thing in one of the 360 shots that we did.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.600]   It was stereo. At the end, my brother was Steadicam.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.800]   He'd get to the end of the walk and they'd turn the Steadicam sideways.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.680]   And it always told us when that person got to that part of the oculus test,
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   because they would take their headset off immediately.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   Which they'd pull it up and they're like, "Oh, you're done."
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.320]   You know, anyway.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.280]   So you can't change it.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.680]   And where that becomes a problem is you have to...
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.680]   Making content for... This is why it's important to do a lot of content.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.760]   Making content for these headsets is completely different than making content for TV.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.480]   Because you actually have to slow down the edits.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.280]   You can't, for some people, especially at higher frame rates,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.880]   you can't have big moves, big helicopter moves,
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.960]   jib moves, shaky camera.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.800]   All those things are gonna affect people's experience of the piece.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.280]   And so you have to build the content.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.840]   Eventually, people are gonna not be building content
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.080]   that they're trying to take to the theater and to the headset.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:52.640]   Oh, interesting.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.760]   What you're gonna start seeing is you're gonna start seeing high frame rate,
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.400]   you know, at least 60 frames a second, possibly 120 eventually.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.520]   But high frame rate content has less cameras, possibly only one camera,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:10.080]   experiencing those things and kind of slowing everything down.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.000]   Because that's what people are gonna like.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.080]   And that's also why, you know, the cameras on the headset
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:16.880]   are gonna be really good.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.800]   As soon as people realize they can't treat the headset,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.400]   like they treat their cell phone, which is like,
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.320]   they'll go up and down like this and be dancing.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.680]   When people put those headsets on to shoot their kids,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.800]   or, you know, whatever they want to shoot film in 3D,
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.120]   they're gonna have to think like a camera person
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.240]   and not move their head very much.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:32.880]   [laughs]
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.200]   Rich de Murrow, who was my replacement on the radio show.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.080]   And by the way, proves that Apple hates me.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.000]   Because he not only was invited to the event,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.680]   but got to try on the headset.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.760]   He said he tried to get sick and he couldn't.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.360]   I don't know how hard he tried.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.880]   I don't know how hard he was able.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.720]   [laughs]
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.280]   This is lukewarm pork and everything.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.240]   [laughs]
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.680]   We're getting in there.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.200]   Passing the other,
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.760]   passing the outside world into the headset
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.680]   has a huge impact on how you,
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.640]   whether you feel sick or not.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.080]   But remember, you're not always doing that.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.120]   You may not want to do that.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.560]   That's what that crowd does.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.600]   Especially how much it dials in,
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.800]   how much of the outside world.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.120]   You're right.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.360]   If I'm a person gets nauseated,
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.160]   I might want to dial in more of the natural world.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.120]   These are, now, I want to know if anybody
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.080]   knows if it sounded like he said,
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.440]   "Micro OLED screens."
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:21.840]   Micro OLED.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.640]   Micro OLED.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.280]   Micro LED.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.320]   Micro LED.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:24.800]   Micro OLED.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.640]   Micro OLED, yes.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.680]   That has a big difference.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.080]   These are OLED screens.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.680]   He also said, "Micro OLED with Apple Silicon backplane."
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.640]   So that was within the presentation.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.080]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:40.880]   I don't know what that means.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.280]   I don't know what that means.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:41.840]   I don't know what that means.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.000]   Exactly what he means by that.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   Exactly.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.440]   7.5 micron pixels,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.040]   23 million on two panels.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.040]   If I do my math correctly,
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.800]   that's 11 and a half million per panel.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.840]   That means 4K, roughly 4K.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.680]   Three element lenses as well,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.960]   which is, they said that's a big deal.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.960]   I don't know why that's a big deal.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.240]   But anybody stop me.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:04.960]   Stop me.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.400]   I'm just going to keep going through the specs
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.600]   and you stop me if you have something to add.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.240]   M2 in this, of course,
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.920]   it'll be an M3 next year and M4.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.640]   Actually, it's interesting because if it comes out
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.080]   next year, it probably should be an M3.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.320]   They might end up shipping it with an M3, I would imagine.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.440]   And a new chip that Apple's designed,
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.320]   called the R1, which sounds like a DSP.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.880]   It's designed to support all the inputs,
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.160]   the cameras and so forth and keep that responsive.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.080]   Yes.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.120]   I mean, it's kind of amazing.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.880]   I mean, the R1 is an amazing chip.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.280]   It gets back into,
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.200]   you have to know a lot about chip design
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.240]   to build something that is built,
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.480]   really purpose-built for this headset.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.320]   And not a lot of companies could put that together.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.440]   And again, I think that's part of what makes this thing work.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.200]   There are 12 cameras, five sensors,
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.080]   including LiDAR, by the way,
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.560]   in the bridge of your nose, six microphones.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.240]   In order to do the processes within 12 milliseconds,
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.200]   you need something special.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.160]   That's the R1.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.080]   Do we know any more about the architecture of the R1?
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.280]   Do we know anything about it?
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.600]   It sounds like a DSP.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.160]   I don't know.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.280]   I don't think they've shown it.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.400]   They've not revealed it.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.600]   It's a tip too in the R1.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.280]   So quickly, go back.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.120]   So in the process of creating OLED,
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.600]   you deposit it onto a substrate.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.040]   The Apple Silicon backplane is that substrate.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.280]   So they made a custom-designed substrate
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.000]   on which the--
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.240]   That's what switching the pixels on and off.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:38.880]   And all of that.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.600]   Okay.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.640]   Micro LED has actually an LED per pixel.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.720]   It's a entirely different technology.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.040]   And eventually, we'll be on probably your iPhone and your Mac.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.280]   And maybe it'll be inside the Vision.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.800]   I don't know, the Vision Pro.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.280]   By the way, were we surprised that it's Vision OS
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.560]   after they trademarked all those other OSs?
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   After they threw us all those.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.520]   No, they were kind of red herrings in the galore there.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.000]   They weren't there.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.680]   I think they're trying to catch more leakers.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.880]   Maybe that was it.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.160]   That's how many they need to reserve.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.240]   Vision Pro is the name of the device.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.920]   And note the Pro.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.400]   And everybody's been saying that this is a Pro device.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.280]   Vision OS is the operating system.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.840]   Any more insight into what it really is,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.920]   it does look a little bit like iPad OS.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.120]   I'm sure still as a model,
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.160]   like it has all the features of Mac OS, right?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.280]   It does support Unity.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.480]   Alex, I know you prefer the--
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.200]   No, I don't have any--
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.080]   I don't have any--
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:40.960]   No, I think that--
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.880]   I mean, I think we've talked about this for a long time.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.800]   I think that Epic's lawsuit with Apple was an Epic failure.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.200]   Yes.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.000]   Like it is--
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.400]   It should support the Unreal Engine, but it won't.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.880]   Well, Apple had--
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.920]   It's not just that Unreal could have done this.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.880]   Unreal was being brought up on stage
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.880]   every keynote for a couple of years as Apple built up towards this.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.200]   They obviously knew where Apple was going with this.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.840]   They were building into it and they decided
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.720]   that taking a high-risk maneuver was more important than what they were getting added onto
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.120]   and opened up the lawsuit.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.000]   And now--
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.760]   And the thing is, is that most of us didn't--
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.080]   We had forgotten that Unity really did anything.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.600]   By the time the lawsuit started,
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.160]   we had kind of forgotten the Unity.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.000]   And I had done a lot of Unity development.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.480]   And then as soon as this happened,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.360]   all of us were kind of like,
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.720]   "Well, we'll see what Apple does with Unity."
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.840]   And the question really was,
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.560]   "Is Apple going to build its own development platform,
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   or whether it's going to use Unity?"
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.760]   And it looks like it's a bit of both.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.240]   So Apple's building up their own capacity to do that,
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.120]   but they've taken a relatively good solid path,
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.960]   which is they can't fix everything.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.280]   And so--
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.920]   Joe Rossignol, who's a senior reporter at Mac Rumors,
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:55.760]   says that there is a WWDC session just came out that calls it X-R-O-S,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   and the slide is X-R-O-S.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.000]   So apparently, X-R-O-S was an internal name,
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.880]   but it's Vision-O-S.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.240]   I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.360]   But yeah, so I think that I think it's going to be interesting
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.600]   to see how the process with Unity though,
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.840]   I mean, I think that it is helpful,
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.920]   because there's no way they could build their own OS,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.360]   from the ground up to that.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.040]   - Their own engine, yeah.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:19.600]   - Yeah.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.160]   - The most advanced personal electronics device ever,
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.760]   crows Apple.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.280]   And I think that's fair, actually.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.000]   It probably is.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.120]   - It's incredibly advanced.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.400]   - I mean, they built a spaceship for your face.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.280]   - Yeah.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.920]   - Yeah.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.800]   - Where you look stays private,
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.560]   because those aren't really your eyes.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.400]   Does it?
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.320]   Now here's the thing, I want to know.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.160]   Is it like one of those uncanny things,
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.720]   like Jesus,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.960]   whether it follows you wherever you go, like the other?
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.520]   - Do I?
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.480]   - The eyes are always--
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.920]   - Are they always looking at you?
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.240]   - We didn't see anyone with it on their face,
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.120]   because they have not--
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.320]   - Yeah, why did not--
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:52.640]   Okay.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.040]   Conspiracy theory time.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.520]   Why did we not see anybody wearing it?
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.600]   - I genuinely feel it's because--
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   - Any executive, any Apple, you know--
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.960]   - Well, no one was able,
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.480]   was allowed to take any video with it.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.080]   - It would have fallen apart if they put it on.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:06.640]   - Who could demo,
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.920]   because I don't think they've nailed the outward view yet.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.000]   It looked good in the photos that we saw, but it's--
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.520]   - Do you think Alex does her fake eye balls?
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.000]   - No.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.480]   - No.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.360]   - No, I think they--
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.760]   - There was an uncanny valley element to it.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.960]   - I thought it looks like when Burke is wearing his motorcycle helmet
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.280]   with the sort of visor down,
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.640]   and you could see his eyes through it.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.680]   That's what it reminded me of.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.680]   - Yeah, that would be the best case.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.760]   - There's been so many memes done of Mark Zuckerberg
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.360]   wearing headsets and stuff like that,
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.880]   that I think that Apple probably just said,
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.080]   "We don't want to beat those memes."
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.520]   And we don't want to be the ones that they put those pictures on.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.720]   I think that's probably why they did it.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.280]   - I just--
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:45.760]   - Was just the thing--
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.360]   - Well, now they're going to have creepy eye beams.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.160]   - I think there's memes awaiting no matter what you do,
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.120]   to be honest with you.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.960]   Those eyes are generated from the scan that you do
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.800]   with the LIDAR on your smartphone, on your iPhone, initially.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.560]   And that also creates your avatar for use in face
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.280]   time.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.160]   I have to say, the FaceTime usage is use case is not compelling.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.560]   It's not like, and they did this because they didn't want to do
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.960]   what Meta did with the spaces and the feet,
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.800]   the legs are missing and all that.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.360]   Those people are not in the room with you,
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.400]   they're on a screen.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.320]   So basically, you're just seeing a FaceTime screen with--
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.880]   - I thought that that demo was the least compelling thing
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.680]   that they did in the interview.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.040]   - It's no better than regular FaceTime.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:27.680]   - It was worse.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.080]   - It's worse because they're not seeing you,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.200]   they're seeing your avatar.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:31.680]   - Yes.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.480]   - And this is, I think that this was the one place where I felt
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.320]   there was a mistake done in the keynote,
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.000]   which is they chose later on in the technology portion
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.880]   to talk about what you looked like in a FaceTime call.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.080]   So I kid you not, when they first showed off FaceTime using it,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.360]   everybody was so distracted talking to one another going,
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.560]   "So what do I look like in it?
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.040]   What do I--?"
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:51.360]   - Yes.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.240]   - No one was paying attention.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:52.880]   - That's what we were saying.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.760]   - No one was paying attention.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.720]   We were all asking questions,
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.840]   we were all processing in our head.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.160]   - So it is.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.280]   - How is it possible that we look?
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.720]   And then they finally addressed it.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.640]   I think that that was a mistake because it took everybody out
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.960]   of the moment where up to that point you heard these ooze
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.960]   and aus, suddenly there was this murmur of,
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.680]   "Why are they not telling us what we look like in this view?"
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.000]   - Right.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:08.960]   - And I--
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.360]   - They should have focused on your presentation.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   Because the other time that happened is when they said,
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.600]   "And we're finally bringing to the iPad an app
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.080]   that we've never brought to the iPad before."
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.000]   And I think everybody in our audience,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.520]   I bet you everybody in this theater was saying,
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.320]   "The calculator?"
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.360]   - Oh, I thought it was Xcode.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.040]   - Hell, yeah.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.360]   - Wasn't the calculator was hell, but we'll get to that.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.000]   I hope.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:28.560]   - Yeah.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.960]   But there's only eight hours in the day, but if we can,
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.000]   we'll get to that.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   - But actually just quickly going back to I-View,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.400]   you are right that the trick,
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.080]   we have that roadside picture of Jesus with the eyes following.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:44.480]   - Yeah.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.440]   - It's the same technology.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.880]   It's a lenticular display.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.360]   - It's lenticular.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.120]   - So that if people look you from one side,
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.760]   they'll see, they'll see the side of your face.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.200]   They look you from the street ahead.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.160]   - So when I'm wearing that, and our housekeeper comes into vacuum,
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.200]   everywhere she goes in the room, it'll be like,
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.320]   "I'm looking at her."
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.200]   - Yeah.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:03.840]   - Right?
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.800]   - I like that.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.920]   - I like the idea of it.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.120]   I like that they're thinking about,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.000]   "Well, how do I interact with people in the room?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.200]   How do people know that,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.080]   "Hey, look, I'm actually got the knob turned all the way to,
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.520]   I don't want to see anybody in the room.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.960]   So don't try to don't think that you're actually making eye contact with me,
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.680]   versus how do I give myself a sense of feeling of presence?"
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.240]   But just like with those avatars,
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.560]   it seems like the risk of looking incredibly dorky with this,
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.960]   because this technology kind of works.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.600]   It works admirably well, but not well enough.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.080]   I think the risk is very, very, very high.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.600]   I do think that the,
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.320]   I did notice one thing that kind of got me interested in the avatars,
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.360]   that they mentioned that they can also represent you,
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.880]   basically if there are people who are just using a regular Mac or regular iPhone
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.920]   to FaceTime with you, your avatar will be just basically,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:03.840]   will be you in their view of you in the FaceTime call.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   It made me wonder if that couldn't be something that I could use,
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.880]   even if I didn't actually have the headset on.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.880]   Like if I owned it or in some way created this avatar,
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.880]   but it's like, I don't want, I want to do Mac weekly.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.080]   No, I think they said it could.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.280]   I don't want to have to find a hoodie, a clean hoodie and prevent it.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.200]   That's a feature, Sega.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.880]   They're going to move that into FaceTime, I think.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.560]   They said that was a feature and I got it all.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.800]   No, that's definitely a feature.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.720]   But what I'm wondering is that if it will work,
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.320]   if again, if I don't own one of these things,
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.200]   because I think it's going to be.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:33.200]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.840]   Yeah, because that's why you don't use your thing to scan it.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.040]   Use your phone to scan it.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.200]   So, I think that, I think that, I think that what's interesting.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.160]   If there was ever a zigzag, I think it's actually that face,
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.480]   that face there, because I think that I really felt like
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.640]   Memojis was building up to be you when you want to be virtual.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.360]   And then it felt like, because the problem is that the uncanny valley level of that is going to be,
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.160]   like even just seeing the demo at its best quality,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.200]   I could see the weirdness that happened in that.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.720]   It was very polar express.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.840]   It was, but uncanny valley.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.280]   That's the poster child for uncanny valley.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.920]   So, I just think that I think that it was, it's so close.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.600]   And the problem is, if I had the choice of scanning my face and being in there or being my Memoji.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.000]   And I think this is one thing that Apple really has done well, is that Apple has the only
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.880]   Memojis or style like that that potentially looks better than you do when you put a turn on.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   Whereas all the other ones are kind of like a, you know,
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.160]   meadows and a snap and everything else.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.160]   They make ones that are, they all are like a dorky, pretty dorky version of you.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.640]   And I think that Apple Apple has actually done a really good job with Emojis.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.800]   Now we're kind of throwing that out and doing something that's going to be,
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.840]   I'd rather be a cartoon than be something that's really close to my, to my face.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.720]   You know, so.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.880]   The other thing I thought was way advanced ahead of anything anybody else is doing.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.480]   There's no physical controllers.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.160]   It's looking at your hands and you don't have to put your hands in front of you.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.600]   Your hands can be in your lap.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.680]   And the gestures, similar to the gestures Microsoft proposed for the HoloLens,
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.400]   but a lot, it looked like a lot more effective because, and this is, I think, the most school thing.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.480]   It's tied to your eye tracking.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.760]   So they have, it sounds like very sophisticated eye tracking.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.920]   Because the interface requires, if you want to say, click an icon that you look at the icon,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.240]   the icon, once it sees you looking at it,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.880]   pop pulses a little bit.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.000]   And then you tap two fingers together anywhere, like on your lap and you click it.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.360]   Your eyes are the cursor.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.560]   Your eyes are the cursor.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.680]   Mark has Bradley said similarly, you could look at a field and then start talking.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.360]   And it would automatically, just as it does on the Apple TV when you press the button,
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.000]   it would automatically fill in the field with text.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.800]   I think that's pretty innovative and does solve a problem that other headsets have.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.160]   And it really, one of the things I really find puzzling,
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.920]   Matt has talked a lot about this.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.400]   Microsoft talked a lot about this, Apple did too,
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.960]   is the use of these devices, not as entertainment devices, but as productivity tools.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.480]   And that's why the HoloLens had flicks and swipes and all sorts of weird gestures.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.160]   They had a gun gesture.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.280]   And I don't know if that's really what anybody wants to do for lifting.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.480]   Oh, and for HoloLens, they had a Deltoid problem, which is that your shoulders.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.880]   You know, you have to be caught in front of it.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.680]   Raise your hands.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.360]   Everything you want to do is like this.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.680]   And so you had to hold your arms up for, again, if you're going to use it for a long period of time,
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.720]   two hours or something, it's not a big deal to do this every once in a while.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.360]   It's a big deal if you're going to do it for two hours, you're going to be up like this.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.160]   The take is an issue.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.200]   So being able to sit there and do what you want to do.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.720]   In general with all of these, which is how long you want to wear this thing.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.240]   It's going to get sweaty on your face.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.560]   I don't care what kind of custom muff you've made, what kind of fans you have.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:57.040]   And then there's the issue of, you know, it's just kind of an uncomfortable setting.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.440]   So Apple really has solved this by making sure that you can't wear it for more than two hours.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.400]   The battery dies.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.600]   No, you can plug it in.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.000]   You can't.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.760]   I was going to say, I was going to say, I was going to say, I wonder how hot I guess when you use it that way.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.280]   So it's a battery pack that has a type C connector on it as well as the proprietary
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.880]   connector that walks onto your walks onto your helmet.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.200]   It's easy.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.160]   The people who got the demo say that it actually kind of twists and walks into the helmet.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.400]   Oh, which kind of makes sense because.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.320]   You don't want to.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.160]   Well, not, well, not, not only that, but if it disconnects, you're suddenly completely
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:32.880]   blown.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.840]   Because you don't have, you don't have see through that's actually just cameras or they're doing that.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.760]   So they would want that to be locked in.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.480]   Although that does, I wonder how much discussion they had on how long does this tether have to be
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.600]   to the battery?
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.440]   Because they're going to be, if we, if you have to say a requirement of using this device is that
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.760]   you have to have a shirt with a pocket in it, or you have to have clothes that have pockets in it,
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.640]   that's going to be a problem.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.560]   Oh, I can't wait for the third parties to start selling little pouches that I can
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:58.560]   see.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:58.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.760]   That's going to happen.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.720]   Get your.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.280]   I'm waiting for.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.880]   Your Hermes Scottie vest.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.000]   They'll be the Scottie vest.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.760]   You know, vision, vision line.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.080]   Right.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.120]   They also, they also don't have a type C connector on it.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.640]   That's for charging it obviously.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.120]   But if you plug that into the wall or a computer or something, we don't know how much
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.800]   voltage it needs, but it will presumably continue to operate forever.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.040]   You can choose to operate your house or this.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:29.120]   That is what, that is one of the few things that I spotted.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.560]   Like, I wonder if they're waffling here.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.480]   They said that you can use it all day.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.560]   But like a kind of alluded to, did they say that theoretically it can draw power all day?
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.000]   Are they saying that?
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.520]   No, no, no, it's not ever going to overheat and give you a thermal shutdown.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.400]   Like the other headsets do after a certain amount of time.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.640]   That will be, I'm sure they don't have that answer today and they will have the exact
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.680]   next year, what it launches, then we'll know what all day.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.040]   There's, there's, there's got to be a reason why these demos last 30 minutes,
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.280]   but then they kick the other hell out after 32 minutes like,
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.360]   tick off, tick off now, fuck on six.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.800]   Well, they hose you down.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.800]   We studied thousands of heads.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.600]   Said Apple.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.680]   That, that caused a huge laugh in the audience.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.040]   Yes, for sure.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   To create the most advanced personal electronics device ever.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.200]   And yeah, pretty impressive.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.440]   Again, A plus for technology, A plus for execution.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.040]   I think we'll get to the truth.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.600]   Still out on whether this is a product anybody wants.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   I graduated to stay in for top of my class.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.240]   I got, got, got, got hired by Apple.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.520]   Like my first pick and I spent my first six months measuring heads.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.640]   Well, and I, I know it's a number of tweets and social posts from people who said,
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.960]   you know, I've been working on this for, you know, my, somebody said my 30% of my life.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.200]   And I'm really glad to see it out.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.880]   Finally, I do not want to in any way criticize anybody who worked on this.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.320]   You have done brilliant work.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.560]   It's amazing what you've created.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:02.240]   You've taken a product category that was really not very acceptable and at least
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.320]   raised it to the level that people want to wear it.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.160]   I am not, I am not quibbling with that whatsoever.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   It's very impressive what Apple's done.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.880]   I'm just thinking from the point of view of a product, if, if it's going to be a.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.840]   Yeah, only time, and only time will tell that.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.480]   Can we can't guess?
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:25.360]   I've, you know, I will be, I've kind of gone out on a limb here being Mr. Cranky.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:33.120]   But I will be sincerely surprised if in a few years, this is, this is something people are wearing.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:33.600]   I will be.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.440]   No, I'm glad this is part of the conversation because there, this is, this is, Apple is so good at
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.320]   running these events.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.080]   They're designed to dazzle people who don't have a lot of time to really sit and think they really
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.760]   have to publish it like that day.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.520]   And so there is a lot of stuff that is like, oh my God, it's so bright.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.400]   It's so shiny.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.440]   I'm glad to see that in a lot of, in most of the cans on stuff that I've,
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.520]   writings that I've seen, it is, it is very balanced by how I really, I was really impressed with it.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.640]   But the thing is, I did, my head was a little tired after 30, when I took it off after 30 minutes,
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.840]   it was kind of disorienting going back to the real world, balanced by, hey, I can actually take
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.200]   notes on my phone.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.120]   That's how good like I could see through.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   We have to make sure that we know that what we're seeing is kind of like what we saw in the very
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.000]   first iPhone demo. We're seeing the first, they're pulling it out of the bar and all nice and shiny
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.320]   and bright. So putting it on that little turntable so that we all take a look at it and take pictures
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.280]   of it. This is not the time for where it's even possible to really rate what it can do,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:38.320]   how practical it is and how people are going to be able to even tolerate it on their heads.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.480]   That's going to come probably in December when Marcus Brownlee and I just need to get there
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.080]   as a month before everybody else.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:44.720]   Right.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.520]   And I think Marcus's video was actually pretty balanced.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.480]   I was impressed by it.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.760]   I thought so too in his video. I thought he did, if you're going to watch, I didn't see all of
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.080]   them. I didn't see Justines, but if you're going to watch one, I think that was a pretty
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.680]   good one to watch. He seemed to have a fairly balanced point of view on the whole thing.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.720]   You can't praise it. You can't slam it yet.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.120]   No, it is an interesting thing.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.360]   And God bless him for putting hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:17.040]   And even the other thing that's unknown, even if it isn't something that people want now,
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.960]   Apple's going to spend so much marketing money. You're going to see ads on football
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.880]   like you've never seen.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.440]   I've already seen ads in social media places.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.680]   Sure. It's a little weird to spend any money on advertising now, since they don't have a product.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.120]   But I think come this fall, depending on when they really plan to ship this,
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.760]   you're to start really seeing a blitz.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   If you spend $100 billion developing a product, you can spend $10 billion advertising it.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:48.640]   $10 billion is a lot of ad time. And by the way, I just like to say, as negative as I've been
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:53.520]   about the Vision Pro, we certainly would love some advertising dollars.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.320]   A hundred million. That's all we ask. A fraction of the total.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.400]   I can say you're not going to get up the running area.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.480]   I'm not going to get it. You know what? That's the beauty of this is I don't have anybody's
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:12.800]   Aztikis. Apple wrote me off years ago, probably rightly so. And I'm going to be honest. That's all.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   Was it surprising to any of you that not once was the word or the letters AI?
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.680]   I uttered.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.800]   Not once. They said machine learning, but that was it.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:30.080]   That's interesting because I have now the page from the tracks at WWC up on my screen.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:35.840]   And yeah, there's a whole big ML and vision track, including detecting animal poses,
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:43.680]   discovering machine learning enhancements and create ML and lifting subjects from images in
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:50.720]   your app. But obviously, there's a lot of AI in or machine like really AI is a terrible term.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.840]   So let's say machine learning, that's actually really a better term in everything in this in
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:01.360]   this vision pro. I mean, it's it's doing a lot of work, right? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:07.920]   All right, one more break. And then I think we should unless okay, I'll do a break in a bit,
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:13.280]   but anything else anybody wants to say about the vision pro and Apple's vision for this.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:20.400]   Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. I went through my notes, you know, my outline.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:29.120]   I do have to say Craig Federighi. It's a living God. He was very much looking for the dad joke
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:34.640]   moment. Of course, last time it was running his fingers through his hair as he ran from one set to
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:40.160]   the other. This time it's playing. Is that real? You think that I guess it is? Well,
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:46.880]   the coolest, I just thought I never thought I'd hear Aussie Osborne on a. Yeah, he really
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:52.640]   shredded on that. And he's looking at the Marshall stack. I feel like he might have given a little
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:23:00.240]   concert at one point. Like, yeah, I think for me, the quick thing I'll say is I would I'm most
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:10.320]   looking forward to what we hear about this device come fall, come winter leading into the next year
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:21.600]   because everything that I have heard and learned and seen and am able to discuss suggests that
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.760]   this is very much iPhone demo, a first iPhone demo land right now. And I would like to know what
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.320]   they couldn't talk about yet because they can't promise it, but might eventually be interesting.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:38.480]   I also think they kept a lot of dry powder. That was much less than I think that they've
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.440]   prepared. I think that as we get closer to the actual cell date, there's a lot of powder of
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.800]   what they can show that they didn't talk about at all. Really? That's there. Are you saying that
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:56.720]   because you want it to be true? I just think that might be the case. I think that was a good
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:03.680]   look. Alex knows something I think. But OK, go ahead. Alex, I think you're very correct.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:10.560]   But I'll put all the money. I also think you're very correct. I think you're very incorrect,
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:18.320]   but that's because I haven't signed any documents. But before we move off it, the last thing I wanted
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.480]   to say was just that I'm actually kind of intrigued about the people that are going to buy it at least
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:28.960]   everyone's going to have like a pie chart of how they justify the $3,500. And it's kind of they're
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:36.160]   going to say, oh, $600 for watching videos, $400 because it'll be a nice thing for gaming.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.920]   $800 because I really want to develop for this. But I think that one of, for a lot of people,
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.040]   one of the biggest pieces of the pie chart are going to be being able to do spatial photography
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.880]   and spatial video. The idea of being able to record the scenes around you, not because you're
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:58.080]   creating models or that you're making scenery for some other project, but just to capture something
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.600]   in the greatest fidelity, I agree that, oh my God, if you're spending your limited time on this
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.920]   earth with your adorable three year old child, and you have this big half of a watermelon on your face,
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:17.920]   I think you're parenting. I don't think it's I don't think it's I'm sorry, but just to finish off.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.720]   But I still remember a number of years ago, I tested a rotor view of Sony had these digital
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.800]   HD 3D binoculars, where it was looked like very, very traditional binoculars, but essentially,
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.280]   each half was essentially a HD camcorder that was giving you video. And the number time during
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:42.000]   the month that I had it, I would do things like I would be at Fannell Hall and I would with just
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.280]   with my binoculars be watching like a street performance, and then to be back like in my house and put
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   these things up to my face and to be watching this again in 3D with decent with decent video and
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:01.120]   everything. That was a powerful, powerful thing. And so the idea if $3,500 is going to be a bit
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:06.880]   rich, but I could see somebody who, okay, if I if I if I had made better professional and or
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.240]   financial decisions 20 years ago, and I had that kind of money to spend, I would be really keen to buy
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:19.600]   again 40% of that pie would be, I just want to take shots of where I am right now, not to replace
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.400]   my life, but because later on, I think I'm going to be enjoy the fact that I have these like immersive
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:29.600]   3D recordings of this space that I'm in that I like. And I think that the other thing is, is that I
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.240]   I so I thought that was one of the most compelling things about Google Glass was that I could look
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.800]   up and I could say, you know, Google take a video or whatever, and it would start to record. And I
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.880]   have these incredible little videos that I found I just found recently on my Google account
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:50.000]   of my kids when they're much younger from my point of view. Now only in 2D and 720p, I'm going to
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.600]   assume that this is going to capture the video probably pretty close to the resolution that I'm
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.760]   looking at it at 4K because they can do that with their phone, little, you know, the phone can do it.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.040]   So they can probably do it there. If I'm getting those, there's there's two things there. One is
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:06.640]   that there's going to be a, I think an interesting market for shooting things that you want to
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.560]   experience. Another thing is to shoot things over the family. And when other people have these headsets,
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.520]   you know, I think that shooting for them will be also, you know, interesting. And I think you're
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.080]   going to see people going to a sporting event or other things and shooting something for someone
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.880]   that's in 3D that is all there and they can then watch it as if they were, as if they were there.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.480]   And I think that's going to be an interesting little model that occurs there.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.480]   It's going to be an interesting driver for when the people, the first adopters will be shooting all
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.720]   this video and maybe a lot of people when it comes down to 1500 and they're like, oh, I really
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.680]   wish worth $1000. But now that I see that, ooh, this is three or four different VR channels that
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.000]   people are telling me about, about people who were at live events that recorded really, really well.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.560]   And finally, finally, I did the, I did the thing that since you mentioned it, I did think that was
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.640]   really, really interesting because that was the exact same demo that was in like the intro of
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.800]   Google Glass. Like, hey, I'm a, I'm a mother and I'm watching, I'm wearing, I'm able to play with my
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.520]   child, have eye contact with her, play with her while still like capturing this moment in video
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.440]   without feeling as though like I'm parked behind a camcorder. So I thought that was an interesting
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.840]   bit of like cross cross pollination. Glass was a little bit more transparent.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.280]   Like for this, for the Apple one, it'd be more like, I'm going to take a moment with this and
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.760]   I'm going to put them back because I don't want to stick man.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.480]   I don't want to leave you know if I can shower with vision or not.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.400]   Oh God.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:33.920]   I think it's sad that people want life so different from the life they're leading that they're
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:39.360]   willing to. Didn't you point that out though that there's a lot of media that sort of centers
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:43.440]   around getting out of the life they're living because everything is bleak and horrible and
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:52.240]   every single use of every single use of VR in fiction and in film is because they're escaping
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:58.400]   from dystopia, whether it's Ready Player One or Snow Crash, where a neuro-master is always to
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:05.840]   escape at Wally. And you know what? That is probably the single best reason these are going to
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:12.080]   succeed because we're going to be in a living hell in about 50 years. So here's the, get me the
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:18.400]   glasses. By the way, we already, this is a little, I cut this out of our whiteboard in the other
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:25.440]   studio. We've already started talking about what we might call the next shows. Here we go.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:33.840]   Welcome to this week in vision. Vision today. It's vision weekly or hands-on vision. No hands-on
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:40.080]   vision. That's how about eyes on vision? Oh, that's funny. You want to host that? Eyes on
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.560]   vision? I'll buy you one of those. Pinch me. We have to do the whole show though. I think
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.480]   the whole show has to be done as a FaceTime in the GOG. I think that, yeah. Oh yeah.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:56.160]   Eventually, we would be replaced with those. Yeah, we'd offer you that 3D, Stariest Copy,
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.120]   View of the Show. You could wander around behind us.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:05.200]   You know, Apple announced some things that people actually want, believe it or not.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:11.520]   And can get. And can even buy. We'll talk about that in just a bit with our fabulous panel,
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:18.240]   our show today. Fabulous. Brought to you by ZipRecruiter. Did you know this is a wild stat.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:26.800]   On average, it takes 11 weeks to hire for an open position. 11 weeks. That's almost three months.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:32.800]   That's a quarter. That's all. That's time that everybody else has to work extra hard to fill in the
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   gaps. That's the amount of time, 11 weeks that the manager, your boss or you, if you're the boss,
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.200]   has to go through this kind of not pleasant process of finding people.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:52.240]   Do you really have that kind of time? No, no, but good news. You don't have to. If you're
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.680]   listening today, I got some great advice for you. Do what we do. We had an opening in our,
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:03.200]   I mentioned this before in our continuity department, when our wonderful Ashley decided to, you know,
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:08.080]   she won work a little closer to home. She had a long commute. So she gave us two weeks notice.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.440]   We immediately, I remember Lisa doing this. It was a breakfast, went to ZipRecruiter. We've done
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:20.320]   it many times before posted the job. Within literally an hour or two, we started getting,
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.120]   I love it because Lisa's very, you know, it's stressful. She's going on. What are we going to do?
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.440]   I don't know. We're going to admit it. We're down a person. It's going to be very hard.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.800]   Two weeks from now, I'm going to have to work, you know, eight hours extra, whatever.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:38.320]   Within an hour after posting, she said, Oh, this person's, oh, this person's, we end up getting,
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:44.080]   I think three or four really, it was very tough. We chose the best though, Viva. We love you.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.840]   And we're so glad we use ZipRecruiter. Stop waiting. Start using ZipRecruiter. ZipRecruiter can help you
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.760]   find qualified candidates for all your roles fast. And right now you could try it for free,
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:01.840]   ziprecruiter.com/macbreak. There's so many things to love about ZipRecruiter. I'll tell you some of
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.280]   the ones that we love. One, you're posting the large, you know, you're casting a broad net,
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.240]   the largest possible group of people. Because if you agree, the right person is there somewhere,
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:16.560]   you got to reach them, right? So one post on ZipRecruiter goes to 100 plus job boards,
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.680]   it goes to social networks, it goes everywhere. Now you've cast a wide net, but you might say,
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:24.480]   in fact, if you've ever done this before, I know what you're saying, you're saying, but I don't
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:30.000]   want them all to call me. Are they going to all email me? No, no, that's the beauty of it.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.640]   It all goes into the ZipRecruiter interface. They even reformat resumes. So they're easily scanned,
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:41.040]   because they're all in the same format. They even allow you to add screening questions,
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:45.760]   true/false, multiple choice, even essays. So you can screen out people who just don't fit right
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:52.000]   away. You don't waste any time looking at those. And then you can quickly rank the people,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:00.400]   eliminate the ones that don't fit, hire the right one fast. It's so great. So that's one thing I
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.360]   love about ZipRecruiter. Another one though, that's really amazing. They use their,
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.840]   they have more than a million current resumes on file, because people come to ZipRecruiter
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:12.320]   looking for work, right? So they use their powerful matching technology to quickly find
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:18.320]   and send the most qualified people to you. So in addition to the applications you're going to get,
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.640]   you're also going to get a message from ZipRecruiter saying, "Hey, look, we found these five people who
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:28.400]   seem to fit your needs. Maybe you'd want to talk to them." And then you look at who you like and you
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:33.920]   invite those people, those people, by the way, really are great because they're going to respond
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.560]   to you. They're so flattered that you ask, they show up for the interviews, it's really great.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.160]   I think it's no surprise of four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter,
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:49.040]   get a quality candidate within the first day. Frankly, we got them within the first hour.

[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.920]   Oh, goody-goody. They started right at the beginning with Macs. I love that.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:41.680]   wasted no time to leap into the thing I care the most about. We had heard that they might
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:50.320]   announce a MacBook Air 15-inch. Indeed, they did. The words that warmed me to the bottom of my heart
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:58.960]   pre-order today, shipping next week. I ordered immediately, and mine comes next Tuesday.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:05.920]   Nice. What color? I have like you. In fact, this is why I didn't really need this. I have the M2
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:16.240]   Midnight Blue. My daughter needs a new computer. That's my excuse. She has a really old MacBook
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.200]   Air. I'm going to give her this one. I got the 15-inch, but I couldn't bring myself to get the
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.520]   Midnight because of the fingerprint problem. Fair enough. At least I got a MacBook Pro that was
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.800]   silver like old school. I remember those days. I thought, for nostalgia reasons, I got it.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:36.720]   I wish I had the silver one when I was at the event yesterday because right as the event started,
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.280]   the sun was still beating down on us and this darker color was absorbing heat. I had this on
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.520]   my lap. I put my hands on it and it burned my hands. Luckily, as the event went on, the sun
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.800]   moved behind us. It wasn't as much of an issue, but Dan Moore had the silver one. I thought,
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:56.320]   oh, I wish I had that one. I've also discovered it's very handy for blinding people with the keynote
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:03.120]   speakers with your laptop when you hold it up and show it to them. This is the...
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.840]   Andy, you coined this and I love this. What is it? A feature quilt? A feature quilt. I love that.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.360]   It's a feature quilt for the MacBook Air 15. It's MagSafe Touch ID.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:21.600]   Really, actually, you don't even need this. It's exactly the same as the 13.3. It's just a little bit
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:27.520]   bigger. Interestingly, I did some calculations. I was very pleased to see the same dots per inch
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:33.520]   as the 13.6, which means... Okay, me, we're wondering. I'm going to get an inch more. I'm going to get
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:39.760]   about 200 pixels more top to bottom. That's an inch more and I think a little more than an inch
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:46.240]   on the sides. It will give me more real estate. I was worried that the pixels per inch were going
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:52.400]   to go down and so it would just be bigger icons. But no, good news. I think honestly,
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.120]   also, the best thing about this is that it resulted in the price drop on the 13.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:03.920]   Yeah, 100 bucks off on the 13 and on the M1. This is Apple's best-selling Macintosh
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.400]   and will continue to do so. I think the 15-inch... They're smart to do this. I think there will be a
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:14.640]   real market for it. They also are giving you a 10-core GPU, which was one of the things you had to do
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:23.600]   in an upsell, a builder order for the 13.6-inch. They're giving you the six-peaker sound system
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.520]   that the MacBook Pro has. That was one thing I was unhappy with on the MacBook Air.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:34.480]   It was the sound wasn't great. I missed... At least it's MacBook Pro. 14 sounds so good.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.720]   Oh, wow. I never listened to audio out of this thing.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.200]   Yeah, really sounds good. 24 gigs of memory of the Macs. That's a little disappointing.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.880]   Two terabytes of storage. That's a good idea. I think they're making a pretty good separation
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:52.320]   between the Pro and the Air. The Air is great. It's got a lot of real estate. It's definitely not
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.040]   a Pro computer. It's not like... I don't think we have any mistakes as Pro users that we should be
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:03.040]   using in the Air to do what we do. But the M2 is so good. It's so good that you really can do a lot.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:07.760]   I mean, I'm not going to do photogrammetry, but it's great for what most people do.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.600]   I think that for most people who are not doing a lot of media and so on and so forth,
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.640]   I think it's going to be great. Creating media. Not viewing media. Creating media.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:26.160]   100%. Yeah. I think that the two extra Thunderbolt is very important. Anytime I'm on the road with
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:33.840]   the MacBook Pro, I use all of those ports. They're smart to limit the RAM and to limit the ports
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.560]   because that's what makes it less than a Pro. I would love to make the Pro ones beefier.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.640]   I would love to add an 1/8 of an inch to it and have it last 50% longer or 100% longer.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:52.160]   When you're typing in numbers, it's 18 hours or whatever. But when I'm rendering in Compressor
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:39:00.480]   or Cinereau 4D, it's like three hours. So I need to, we definitely need,
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:05.840]   I think the Mac Pro, I'd love to see them get beefier and thicker and more powerful and have
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   the errors continue to hold that space so that Apple's not trying to do the same thing with both
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:16.000]   of them. This is the GarageBand iMovie computer. You're looking at the Final Cut Logic computer.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.880]   I'll be honest, Final Cut Logic, I'm sure, would run for many small projects would run just fine
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.240]   on the air. Where it becomes problematic is, again, when you start to do long renders,
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:32.880]   there's going to be heat throttling there on long renders as well as the lack of
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:38.720]   Thunderbolt ports is a big deal because one of them is power. It has a Mac save plus two.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:45.520]   Weirdly, 18 hours battery life across the line. There's no improvement even though you have more
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.960]   space. I'm thinking maybe that's why they have six points. It's set up like make sure.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:54.400]   Yeah, the speaker is the 10 core base. So do I need more battery or do I need more speaker?
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.840]   I want more speaker. I think that was a good, 18 hours is plenty for me.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.560]   And that's, they say you watch it. I think if you're using a Mac, again, because it's not,
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.280]   that's a user case. Well, good news. Guess what? They also updated the Mac studios
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:16.240]   to massive horsepower, right? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, M2 Ultra is the largest
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:26.720]   chip 76 core GPU 24 core CPU. Now I have to say for a pro, I've been told I can't imagine this.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.560]   192 gigabytes of RAM is not enough. It's, it, it's pretty good. I mean, like, there's not that
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.160]   many of them. I mean, well, when you get into really big renders and photogrammetry and other
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.960]   things like that, there's an in science calculations. And so there's a bunch of things that you have
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:46.560]   to hold all in RAM at one time. And so 192 can be limited, but that, that market is
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.760]   crazy small. Like, there's one thing to be small market and then there's to be a tiny, tiny little
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:58.320]   market that would need that, that much more RAM. But, but I do think that for the most part,
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.400]   192 is a pretty, I mean, it's amazing. I had to write a three page paper to go from 128 megabytes
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.440]   of RAM to 192 megabytes of RAM megabytes for Star Wars.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.520]   megabytes. That's what I was rendering ship with.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.680]   You know, and so 192 is quite a bit. So much, so much. And that's an important point. Somebody
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:24.160]   saying, you mean of GPU memory? No, of unified memory. So that is a point is that your GPU can use it.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:27.600]   So it's, you know, that's stunning.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:34.160]   Yeah, that's a lot for a GPU. Yeah. They mentioned it on the feature quilt for the Mac studios,
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.640]   but it's, I think also true of all M2s. There's a neural engine. And the key on this is very
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:46.400]   interesting because Microsoft, which is still stuck with Qualcomm and Intel, has been hurting
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:52.560]   because of this. They've been talking about NPUs for a long time. They coined the term neural
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.160]   processing unit, but only the Qualcomm chips have NPUs. They're waiting for this fall when Intel
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:05.200]   announced Meteor Lake and put out an MPU based Intel platform. So Apple has a real advantage
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:12.480]   because all of their hardware now comes with a neural processing engine. That's a big deal, I think.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:18.160]   Not for generating, not you don't use it for generating models, but you use it for all of the
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.240]   kinds of things running running. Yeah, it's kind of wild how much that, you know, even
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:27.760]   we looked at, is it? Wow. And I can't think of his name. The law. Is it Moore's law?
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:33.760]   Yeah, Gordon Moore. Yeah. So Moore's law. When sort of modern computer
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:39.520]   architecture folks have tried to look at how to sort of keep that vision alive,
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:45.680]   they have turned increasingly to these neural engines as a way to sort of figure out how to
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:51.920]   bridge the gap between how much smaller we can now make transistors versus what we would expect
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:57.280]   to see according to Moore's law. And so yes, it's every aspect of your use of the machine where
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.880]   that neural engine is trying to do things in a way that is smarter, which then makes it work faster,
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:09.040]   makes it process better. 31.6 trillion operations per second. I can't fathom
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.600]   how much is 31.6 trillion, right? It's a lot. Yeah.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.760]   You know, we're talking terra flops here. This is, you know, terra terra flops. This is incredible.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:25.840]   And by the way, the eight, the eight K playback, they're talking about a lot of streams of playback,
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.840]   the eight K sounds esoteric until you think about the headset. Yeah, that is an eight K.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.080]   There's two four K screens. Yeah.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:41.520]   800 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth on the Mac studio. I have to say I have the original
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.480]   Mac studio and I have never felt in any way harmed or never the one that's not ultra. I've
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:56.400]   never felt no, I have a I have a pro. Lisa got the max M1. And these are way faster than I need.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:02.240]   So these are impressive. I didn't ask this. Did they increase the number of displays the Mac book
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:07.520]   air could handle? No, they did not. No, but it's still one external 6K.
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:13.600]   Is a really, really good external display like six. Yeah, really good. Yeah. And the great,
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.160]   I hate, I'm sorry that Apple has beaten me down to this level, but I was so excited that it still
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.200]   has a headphone jack. Thank you, Apple for not moving headphone jack. Isn't that sad? The courage
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:29.680]   for it is a studio. It's I definitely still use one of my studio. If I really need to wear the
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:35.600]   I use it. Are you kidding? Yeah. I mean, I'm not using it right now, but I know I have an extension
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:41.680]   cable plugged into it. So if I need to, I can plug the headphones into it. The new studio will
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:49.920]   support up to six. It's kind of six pro display XDRs. I want six. Now, forget VR.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:56.400]   Dare you forget vision pro. I'm going to spend 10 times as much and I'm going to have my,
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.360]   I don't have to wear a helmet. I'll just sit down. It'll be great.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.680]   Well, I have six right now. I mean, I know you do the same computer, but there's, yeah.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:10.160]   Yeah. Right. Of course you can. The NORAD set at the end of war games. That is my ideal
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.680]   ideal work setup. I thought that was a good start.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:22.080]   So this studio really for, I would say the vast majority of people is as much as one
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.080]   you'd ever need. Yeah. I mean, I think that the big, the only thing that you really, what you get
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.840]   with the pro as you start to move up is the, is the increased number of lanes of, of thunderbolt
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:38.320]   and the PCI's, the slots, you know, so having been able to add six cards for IO and being able to
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.080]   have a lot more, I, a lot more lanes for the thunderbolt or the big, well, I think this is
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:50.640]   important because, yes, they finally said we have a Mac Pro. Same. It's the same case, but it's,
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.960]   it's got a shrink ray a little bit. I can't tell. I couldn't tell. Did you see it?
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.840]   Yeah. I actually got there was a video of that as well. Is it a cute little toaster?
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.360]   I suppose to wash it in cold, but warm. It's about the size of a bread box.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:08.080]   Okay. A box size computer. I will say this Apple. See, it looks, it looks a little,
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:13.600]   it's definitely smaller next to the XDR display. That looks good. It's, it's, it's like the new
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.240]   Mac to CI. Yeah. It's really cute. I love that computer. I got a frog.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.360]   If frog design lost like the contract for, for industrial design and
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.720]   I've got to go that. I think is kind of a cool look at the end. You can open it up. So this is,
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:32.480]   I have to say, there isn't a lot of technical difference between no the Mac studio with the
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:37.440]   M2 Ultra and the Mac Pro with the M2. And that is on purpose. Apple and talking with journalists
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:46.800]   has positioned these two models as options. The M2 Ultra Mac studio is meant to be the one for
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:51.600]   people for companies or whomever who don't want to do a lot of thinking that who just want to, I
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.480]   need to, I need the machine that just does what I needed to do. You get it. It's all in one package.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.400]   I should say thinking and tinkering. I have it 134 billion transistors for people who don't
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:05.840]   want to do any thinking. This is yes, in, in trying to pick what they're out. You get this machine,
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.440]   it does what you needed to do. Whereas if you want to tinker, if you want to play around and
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.640]   build, purpose build exactly what you want, that's where the Mac Pro comes in. They're both
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:21.120]   fantastic machines. It's the choice between the two. And I love that. I love what Apple did there,
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.200]   which is that we don't feel like we're getting less to buy a studio. We can break out the Mac
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.880]   studio and have it be a great computer to do. If I'm a 3D, if I'm doing 3D rendering, I feel like
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.360]   I can just go to the Mac studio as easily as I could go to the Mac Pro. But if I need to do video
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.840]   IO, then I know that I need the Mac Pro. I probably want the Mac Pro because I'm now going to
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:46.480]   want all like when I do a video production with my studio, like if I'm using MIMO Live and I,
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:52.000]   you know, wire all those things in, I'm using literally every port on the studio. Like it is
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.680]   every there's a wire going into each one of those for the monitor outs, the camera ends,
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.480]   the all the other things. You know, I would much rather that's the kind of thing I'd rather do on
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:09.040]   a Mac Pro. And you are paying for that capability. So Keith 512 in our IRC configured a Mac studio
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:18.080]   and a Mac Pro with the same base hardware 24 core CPU, 60 core GPU, the maxed out RAM. And that's
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:24.800]   interesting. This the pro only goes to 192 gigs as well. He put a terabyte SSD and now this is in
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:32.240]   the UK. So it was 5,799 pounds for the studio. 8,799 pounds for the Mac Pro.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:39.040]   So for those piece, those PCI four lanes and way more Thunderbolt ports way more Thunderbolt ports.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.760]   And if you're it's going if you know what you need, then then you need that.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:47.360]   Like it's a lot more, but you're gonna get a zoom in on a long time.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.920]   So I own a back pro, which was what? Yeah, I mean, well, and that by the way,
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:59.920]   40,000. You can stop comparing your Intel, your Intel max with your Mac Apple Silicon max.
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:05.680]   Nobody's buying those guys. Those are not there still there still. I do they still selling them.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:12.160]   Yeah, there are things that are like a discrete GPU. You want a radio on card in there?
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:17.600]   Guess what? You ain't putting it in the Mac Pro or that that much RAM or you know,
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.480]   there's a couple of different things that that one still does that the other that the new one
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.960]   doesn't. So there's definitely reasons to have the Intel.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.120]   Yeah, no, I understand, but there's no reason to compare your performance to the Intel.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.480]   That's just that's just like hand waving. I think they'll stop doing it now that they can stop.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:39.360]   Yeah, because they've made it. So the most expensive, the most expensive M2 Ultra Mac Pro is
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.800]   $40,000 cheaper, according to the Verge than the maxed out Intel version. I think that's probably
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:51.040]   the RAM because the Intel one would go to two and a half terabytes of RAM, right? It was a lot more.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.640]   Something insane. Yeah, something something. Yeah.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:03.040]   So I mean, it's apples and oranges at that point. So tell me about this. This is the issue, I think,
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:10.560]   the G the discrete GPU, even though you have PCI bus on there. What can you put those slots?
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:17.920]   Well, like video cards for one. So video and audio I/O cards are things that you would.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:23.120]   It's for I/O. I think that that's the only market, but that's the biggest market.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:26.640]   You can also put in more hard drive. You can put in solid-state hard drive.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:33.680]   So you can put in these very large MBME cards that are like 32 terabytes or whatever that
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:41.440]   you can drop into there. So there's definitely some but I/O drive systems, network systems,
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.440]   but things getting in and out of the computer. It's not going to do a GPU, which is unfortunate.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:50.080]   I mean, a lot of us wish that we could put an NVIDIA card in because of a bunch of custom
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.200]   processes in the NVIDIA. You've got CUDA cores and you can't, but that's never going to happen.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:01.120]   Yeah. So the, but I, but I, but I, you know, it's not that we don't want them. We just
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:07.520]   stop thinking about it. So it's too far away. But the, but the, I think that it's, it's,
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:13.120]   you have an incredible workhorse of, you know, like, so for instance, we were talking about it
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:19.680]   this morning on office hours that, uh, that zoom, you know, if, if we, if we could get enough bandwidth,
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:25.840]   we could pull 48, 48 individual 1080p signals out of that computer with the cards, you just drop
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.400]   the cards in that we buy a sonnet box is for right now. And you'd have one box pulling 48,
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.000]   which sounds crazy unless you're doing a virtual event. You know, so if you're doing an event,
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.280]   you want to grab everybody and be able to jump between everybody and move around,
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.400]   having all those isos might, you know, might make sense. So, so those are things, but right now,
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:48.640]   there's other other limitations, but it's, it's for a very specific, you know, it absolutely is.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:54.080]   Well, and it's going to be, it's, so yes, it's going to be for what it should be is for a very
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.520]   specific group of people, but you know, I live in Marin and, you know, the, the, there's a lot of
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:07.600]   Jeeps in Marin and they are all super clean. They're not going off road. No one's using that Jeep
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:10.880]   for the way. I mean, they have, and we're talking about the Rubicon's, you know, there's a lot of
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:17.200]   Rubicon's in Marin that are pristine, you know, and so, and they even have all the rigs and everything
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.600]   else. So there's a market there for the folks that I would buy into that case. If I had more
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.800]   money than sense, that's a beautiful, it's a beautiful, it's a Johnny Ivy cheese graders gorgeous,
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:31.680]   going to be like Hollywood producers. They have it on their desk. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:38.320]   Yeah. You can get the promise one bucket cheese on it. The promise Pegasus R4i 32 terabyte
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:43.520]   raid module for the Mac Pro. Yeah. Plug it right in. That gives you 30 extra terabytes for three
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.640]   grand. You know what? That's actually the kind of thing. Not bad.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:52.400]   That's a good deal. Less than the vision pro. Yeah. You can, you can put enough,
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:56.400]   enough hard drive space into that, into the computer that, that you can get yourself into an
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:00.000]   enormous, not trouble. Like if you get back, you know, like it's like, it's like, you want to
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.960]   hug a 192 terabytes of drive space in there and the whole thing goes out. So it breaks my heart,
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:16.800]   Disney just fired the woman who saved Toy Story 2. You know the story, right? They accidentally deleted
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:23.280]   the renders for Toy Story 2. The movie basically was deleted. And then they went to the backups and
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:29.280]   the backups weren't good because they had it misconfigured. ELT. They thought they were going to lose
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:37.120]   the movie, right? Right. Then somebody says, you know, I was bringing this home, working at home.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:43.680]   I think I have all the files at home. She probably had the promise 32 terabytes.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:52.720]   I mean, how big is Toy Story 2? Anyway, they rushed over to her house, put the computer like in a
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:58.000]   egg carton, you know, and brought it back and crossed their fingers because that's like,
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.400]   gears are worked down the tubes. They saved Toy Story 2. This poor person, I think she's a woman.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:10.240]   I'm judging from that name. I believe so. I think she was on pregnancy leave either before or after
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.400]   delivering. That's right. That's why she was working on this, but I recall. And of course,
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:18.720]   you know, you know how the poor, the person who deleted everything. It was like the classic,
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:23.920]   was that what you're entering a certain line that says, oh, it's just delete everything from this
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:28.560]   folder. And then he puts a hyphen in there. They're there. And they're like, Oh, no, do this recursively
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:35.760]   to every single volume that's attached. Like, Oh, dear. So Gailin Sussman saved the movie in
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.200]   1998, because she had it at home. It's not the person who hit the lead that was the problem. It
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:46.240]   was whoever was an architecture. They allowed that. Yes. That allowed one person to do it without
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.240]   turning two keys. You know, like it's in addition, like backups doesn't mean you back it up. And
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.120]   then you put the car church someplace like you periodically test your backup to make sure that
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:02.000]   your backups are good. So there's a big like screw up. Everybody had everybody had
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.800]   said to say now this was 1998. She's still it was still at Pixar Disney in their layoffs.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:15.840]   I hope they laid off the guy who deleted the files anyway. But unfortunately, Gailin Sussman is
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.640]   one of the people that has been laid off. He's he's still at the company. He's still like
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.200]   buried underneath the concrete piling from the new campus where he's been for the past 13 years.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.080]   Don't worry. He'll be with Pixar for a very, very long time. He'll outlast everybody.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:36.640]   Yeah. Yeah. You think you'd have a job for life if you saved Toy Story 2, but okay.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:41.360]   Turns out it's only 25 years. That's yeah. That's all you can.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:50.400]   Yeah. So the Mac Pro is here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We can all stop thinking about it.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.760]   The two Macs that were not updated, the Mac mini, well, that just got updated. So I understand that.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.720]   And I think there are probably a few people saying, where's my iMac? We think that that's
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.960]   continuing. Is it over? I don't think it's a priority in any way, shape or form. You got the studio.
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:15.520]   Well, Lisa, for instance, still uses an iMac in her office. It's getting flaky and old.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.800]   And she wants a new one. I said, honey, you're not going to like the new one. It's not 27 inches.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.720]   It's 21 inches. And that's the whole thing. I think they have like, here's people still want
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.400]   that. And as long as it sells enough to make it worth it, I think they'll keep on releasing it.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:36.800]   But I think that they definitely, the Mac mini is in a different place now where it's much more
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:41.680]   modular. You can decide what you want. It's a lot less expensive. The thing that really wears out
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.840]   is the screen and the screen size. And now you can buy a bigger screen for it. And I don't really
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:51.840]   think that I just, now I say that. I just bought an iMac for my parents-in-law, because they had one
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:57.120]   before. And it's all in one place. And you can plug it in and it just works. And I definitely
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:02.320]   see the value of keeping something like that around. But I think that for almost everybody,
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.200]   I think the Mac mini makes more sense. Can we just say that Apple's not going to make another one?
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:12.000]   Or is they still somewhere back in the labs have a 32-inch? I wouldn't be surprised if they don't
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.960]   do updates. I don't think getting a larger one, I very much doubt. I think it's 21 inches. It's
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.880]   going to be, it's not going to get much. It maybe gets up to 24 at some point for whatever reason,
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:27.440]   but it's never going to be another big one. It is going to be an entry-level computer.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.280]   They're not going to make a pro version of it. They've got too many other pro things that are out there.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.680]   So I think that it's going to be a basic computer for kids that go into school or
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.520]   or folks that are retired and just want something that they can turn on.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:42.720]   It's going to be the computer you buy in 12 packs either because you have a
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:48.240]   cup small company or school class. I'm serious. That's bliss. Otherwise,
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:52.160]   Apple, anyone who I think anybody who comes into an Apple store looking for an iMac,
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.960]   there is a training video that says, "Try to get them to buy a MacBook Air for God's sake."
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.400]   Of course, you know, a studio with a nice display. It's what I'm working on. Lisa,
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:04.640]   we'll get you a nice display. If we can get one that matches the other display you're using,
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.040]   we get a studio, you won't know it's not an iMac, but you'll be happier because it's going to be
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:16.720]   modular and it's going to be faster. But it won't be yellow. I mean, in Rwanda, we had some
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:21.120]   voltage issues and everything else going up and down. And over time, the iMacs, we got 40 iMacs
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:26.480]   back in the day. And repairing them was super expensive. We should explain he was teaching.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:33.280]   So these were classes of school. Yeah, school in Rwanda. And the problem that we've had is that
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:38.080]   it's replacing them after the power supply or whatever. It's trying to fix an iMac.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.120]   You can't. No.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.880]   Non-trivial. And so for the same cost, we could have just, if we had monitors instead,
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.680]   we could have just got another Mac Mini. Actually, I think we're getting there many, right, John?
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.320]   I think we're just going to get her a nicer Mini. They're really nice. Yeah, they're fine.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:56.720]   This is all she needs. Yeah. I think we have any big curve around monitor or anything else.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:02.880]   She has a 49 inch curve around monitor and then the iMac. So I think we mean it matching.
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:06.400]   And now she's going to be in half an two 49 inch.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:13.920]   Give you a vertical side. That's your vision. Or if you had four of them, you could have,
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:19.200]   you could have this, you could go to imagine over. Yes, we're trying to put.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:26.480]   I'll see a picture of it. I don't need it. I'll tell you what I'm saving my money for.
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:33.280]   I'm not going to buy the vision helmet. I'm going to buy the 49 inch QD OLED curved monitor
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:39.840]   that somebody's selling. I can't remember if it's LG or, but that's the monitor, right?
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:42.400]   It's a, you know, it's a gaming monitor, I guess. Yeah.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:53.040]   Oh, that's what I'm saving my money for. MSI, I guess it is. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, Samsung too.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:58.560]   Wait, so they're more. Yeah. I have a QD OLED TV, which is incredible. It's the brightest OLEDs out
[01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:03.840]   there. They're really gorgeous. Kind of stunning. So Samsung is going to make a QD OLED. It's the
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:09.760]   odd C OLED G9 available for 12,000. Do you feel like we're getting a suntan? I can't afford a G6,
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:17.440]   but I'm getting a G9. Right, right, right. Exactly. It's not available yet, but
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:22.640]   if it comes down to that of the vision pro, that's going to be. Do you feel the heat from the screen?
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:29.360]   No, QD OLEDs are not. They're not hot. They're not. We were just, we just had a, we were at
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:34.000]   Cinegiro, you know, this big filming thing over the weekend. They're not like plasma. They have
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.400]   like a wall of these, of these lights. And they said, we asked them, they said they get really bright
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:42.480]   and they key turned the whole wall on. And when they turned it on, it's like literally changed
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:47.040]   the temperature. Like we were saying, like, whoa, what was it? It was bright. We just, it's a lot of
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:52.880]   heat. So we got to talk about a software. So that was the hardware. Or anybody buying any of that
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:59.040]   stuff. Any, anything I'm the only one getting the 15 inch. I'll bring it in next week.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:02.320]   I'm not going to get the pro right now, but I probably will get a pro this year.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.680]   Sometimes if I like I said, that M1 studio is really sweet still. I mean, the reason that I got
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:11.360]   the one, the studio was, and I didn't go for the ultra was I was like, oh, I'm going to buy this.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:12.320]   You knew you were by the pro.
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:12.720]   All right.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.040]   The funny thing is, is that I'm going to buy the Mac Pro, but I'm not going to spend more than $12,000.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:20.880]   Like literally, that's what I said. I was like, I'm not going to get some $60,000 machine.
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.360]   And now I don't, I can't afford it right now, but maybe sometime later this year, I'll,
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.720]   I'll sell a kidney or something.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:32.000]   Well, let's, let's configure Alex's Mac Pro. Shall we?
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:32.720]   Let's do it.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:34.320]   Let's put it, let's put it all together.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:38.320]   It's fun spending other people's money.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.600]   Order now. Mac Pro starts at $7,000.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.920]   Let's see. I got some room. Let's see. Let's see. We got some room. All right.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.960]   You probably want the $1,000.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.800]   Yeah, just upsell on the process.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:52.320]   Right. I got the room. I get the room. Okay.
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:52.880]   Okay. Yeah.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:56.400]   60 core GPU versus 76. I think you want to say now, RAM.
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:58.320]   All of it.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:58.960]   All of it.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:59.680]   Okay. It's only.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.400]   I see rendering.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:01.840]   Now we're at 10,000.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.520]   I'm still under and then you need to, here's the deal.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:09.040]   Is the mistake I made with the studios, I bought one terabyte of drives.
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:12.160]   The drives are so fast that you should just get the A.
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:15.840]   The internals are fast. But remember, we can't get that promise card.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:18.640]   I don't think, I still don't think it's going to be as fast as the internal drive.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:18.800]   Right.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.280]   Yeah.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.600]   So we put eight terabytes of storage.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.920]   You don't need the, you don't need the wheels.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:24.960]   Skip on the $400.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:25.120]   No, I won't.
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:28.560]   Skip the $400 wheels, by the way. Glad to see they kept the wheels.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.280]   Yes.
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:31.600]   Glad to see they kept the wheels. They're not cheap.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:32.720]   That's because I made a bunch of that.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.680]   That's all you need, right?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:36.320]   And then we're 11, 799. That's nothing.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.800]   Now with taxes, I'd probably go over.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:42.880]   Well, let's see. I should just put this on my Apple card. That's practically free.
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.880]   Oh, do you need a new new new needle?
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:46.160]   XDR.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:49.760]   Well, I sure would like that. It's only five grand.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:51.760]   Oh, wait a minute. I need nano texture glass.
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:53.360]   Oh, no, I don't want to know.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:54.160]   No, no.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.040]   Comes with a rag.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.240]   Okay.
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:00.000]   Because I don't get the monitor, I don't get the, I don't want to stand there.
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:03.920]   See, John, couldn't I? I'm thinking instead of having this crappy
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:08.240]   Lenovo, I could have an XDR display here on a Visa mount.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:08.720]   You can't touch it.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:10.480]   Oh, you can't touch it.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:12.160]   You can touch it.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:13.120]   Just won't do anything.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.640]   And just doesn't do anything when you touch it.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:16.960]   People were mad. I was really interested.
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.480]   So many people were mad that Apple did release the Vision Pro,
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480]   but did not release a touchscreen Mac.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.120]   Oh, come on.
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:24.080]   Come on, man.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:24.640]   Yes.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.520]   I don't want to touch my Mac.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.080]   Nobody.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:29.200]   I swear to God, I have a lot of touchscreen laptops.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.720]   Yes. And they're all never touching.
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:31.760]   I hate it.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.040]   Never even touched this one.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:33.840]   Oh, he touched it.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.560]   When I love it on my iPad with my keyboard and my iPad.
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:38.160]   Never even touched this.
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:38.720]   Love that.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.560]   But I do not.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:41.840]   I don't know.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:42.160]   I need it.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:42.720]   I'm going to be back.
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:43.040]   No.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:45.440]   When I, when I, when I do use it, I enjoy it.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.200]   But that's not something that I need all the time.
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.000]   I'll have to say that.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.840]   I think that I think that one of the reasons why
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.440]   Apple decided to put those like downward firing cameras
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.360]   on the, on the headset.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:58.640]   So you can do like touch controls like without having to lift your hands is that
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.480]   they're, they know that all of us would be jumping on them for every time.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:05.760]   Apple says, people, no, the reason why we don't do touchscreen.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.760]   So the Mac is people don't want to have to raise their hands to use the computers.
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:10.880]   Like, oh, damn it.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.200]   I had it.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:11.200]   I had it.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:11.360]   I had it.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.040]   I heard we're think piece all lined up.
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:13.600]   I don't know how long can we all know.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:15.760]   We only have 15 more minutes in the show.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.200]   Everybody stick your arm out.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.200]   If you can hold it out for that 15 minutes.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.560]   Right.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:22.400]   I can't believe how many people are doing it.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.480]   Well, I don't know.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.800]   I don't know what, I want to know what I get if I do it.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:27.440]   Nothing.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.000]   Nothing.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.200]   Oh, you're going to touch screen Mac.
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.920]   iOS 17 looks good.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.080]   In fact, you could actually by accident, they put out the developer version for everybody.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:36.800]   So be careful.
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:41.600]   The public preview is next month is in July.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.120]   I'm tempted.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.320]   I don't want to get rid of Hey on Siri.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.320]   Siri Ari is way over responsive.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.600]   Just try saying seriously.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.320]   You have options.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:50.560]   Okay.
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.320]   You can choose if you want to keep it.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.960]   Hey, if you want to have it more than Hey, like, oh, hey, please listen to your.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.280]   You.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:04.160]   Hey, I would recommend that if you want to give this a go as you folks who are developers and
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:07.120]   who are developers here is the host of iOS today.
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.280]   Do iPad, not.
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:09.920]   Good idea.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:10.400]   Because.
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:10.880]   Good idea.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:17.680]   It was very morning had to completely restore the phone because of a bug in iOS before the show started.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:19.040]   She's using the developer edition.
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:21.280]   Yes, she's using developer betas for everything.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:21.680]   Of course.
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.440]   I haven't installed any yet.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.840]   I'm usually a lot quicker, but I was there.
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:26.800]   So I just haven't had time.
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:28.960]   I will not be installing.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.320]   I think this iOS 17.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.040]   I'll tell you what I want.
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:32.320]   But iPad was for sure.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:33.600]   I think the standby is cool.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:34.640]   Right.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.760]   So I'm cool.
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:38.640]   Android has had this if you use the the Pixel stand.
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:41.680]   But they're all trying to figure out what happened to the little who make the words.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.880]   Where did that stand come from?
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.640]   It's just some MagSafe thing.
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.080]   Any MagSafe standard work.
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:47.360]   Sure.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:48.640]   Okay.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.480]   But it looked like one specific.
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:53.280]   It looked like I was waiting for them to say and only $99.
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:56.560]   For this, I finally crafted aluminum MagSafe stand.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.600]   So it turns your iPhone into a bedside.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:02.720]   Actually, I guess the iPad too into a bedside clock.
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:04.720]   Yeah, it's not called standby on iPad though.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:05.600]   It's just that you've got.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:06.640]   You have that capability.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.000]   Customize lock screens and stuff.
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.240]   Name drop looks great to me.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:12.560]   It's going to it's the way to exchange business cards.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:14.640]   It goes along with contact posters.
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:19.280]   So you will now make a contact poster with your face or your avatar or emoji or whatever.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:20.080]   Picture of your dog.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:20.960]   It doesn't matter.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:24.960]   Your name, contact information and that can be your business card.
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:28.000]   And now you and I will meet and I will tap my phone to yours.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.600]   By the way, stand from 12 South and it's available in the Apple.
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:33.120]   Oh, 12 South makes good stuff.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.880]   So that is a real stand.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:35.520]   But only to the iPhone, right?
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.120]   So you'll have 12 South.
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:37.280]   Okay.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.400]   12 South is the maker.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.440]   Yeah, they make great stuff.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:42.000]   But how do you connect with your Android friends?
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:42.240]   No.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.280]   Oh, forget who uses the Android.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:45.920]   It might as well be a green bubble.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.360]   You might as well be a green bubble at that point.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:52.160]   This is all of this stuff is guaranteed to piss off and try to use your second.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:55.680]   You'll be sent it so you can make now that you can always make stickers,
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:59.120]   which was a cool feature you press and hold Mike's face and then drag it.
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:00.800]   And now I get a Mike ahead sticker.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:01.040]   Yeah.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.680]   But I can now do it with a live picture, right?
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:05.680]   So that he could be moving.
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:09.840]   And none of that works between iOS 17 and iOS 16 because Rosemary is trying to send me a bunch
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:10.720]   of them this morning.
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.640]   Oh, so even you'll have to wait.
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:15.840]   So green bubbles are everybody who would accept iOS 17.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:15.840]   Exactly.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:16.080]   Okay.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.240]   I think that's cool.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.320]   Live voicemail with transcriptions.
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:21.520]   Nice.
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:22.000]   Nice.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.840]   For the best features of the Google Pixel.
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:24.720]   I have to tell you.
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:26.080]   So this is interesting.
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:26.400]   Right.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.000]   It's the duo program that does that.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:34.160]   Something interesting I learned yesterday about that live voicemail feature is Apple is kind of
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:36.400]   spoofing this.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.120]   It is something that happens locally on the device.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:44.960]   And what is happening is the phone is essentially answering the call and then
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:50.000]   transcribing with the voice like it plays your voicemail back and transcribes the
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.440]   conversation that takes place.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:55.360]   And if you choose to hit answer, then all it's doing is letting you into the call that
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.320]   it's already taken.
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:57.280]   It has to do that.
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.040]   So that way doesn't make it all a carrier.
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:07:59.680]   Exactly.
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:00.560]   Makes it on device.
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:01.280]   I think that's fine.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:01.760]   I don't.
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:02.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.200]   No, I think it's a good thing.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:03.520]   I think.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.200]   I think that's how good it's a pro.
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:05.920]   I'm not a con.
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:06.240]   Yeah.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:06.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.080]   They've added.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:12.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, the application you've all been waiting for.
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.600]   Journal.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.000]   Journal.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:14.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.400]   You can.
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.360]   It's kind of like day one, but it's going to it's a health thing, right?
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.320]   It's going to have props.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:20.640]   Yeah.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:22.400]   It's going to say be grateful.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.520]   What are you grateful for today?
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:24.160]   That kind of thing.
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:27.200]   I like to look through your whole system and the activities that you're doing.
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:27.600]   Yeah.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:33.120]   And so I can imagine, you know, I'm go we go to an undisclosed location where they show us
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:34.960]   what it's like to make sound for movies.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.840]   I don't know what that is.
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:36.800]   Don't know where that would be.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:37.200]   But.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.840]   And it's like, hey, you recently went to this place.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.680]   What was that experience like?
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.440]   And then I got to write about having that, you know,
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.200]   that's kind of a cool idea with the journal.
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:46.240]   I love that idea.
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:49.920]   And so even better props, even better, they made an API.
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.480]   Yes.
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:51.280]   So I love that.
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.120]   So day one can add this feature other other journaling apps.
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:57.760]   Health is also much improved.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.000]   It looks like in fact, health comes to the iPad.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:00.560]   Finally.
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.360]   Finally.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:02.480]   No calculator for you.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:04.480]   Widgets on the iPad.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:05.920]   That's going to be interesting.
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:08.640]   Because they're especially.
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.440]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:09.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:10.480]   Exactly.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:14.720]   They're interactive and also the fact that you can build a widget one place.
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:16.240]   And basically now, congratulations.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:17.600]   You're the widget for your app.
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:18.960]   Can I be deployed on the watch?
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.000]   Can be deployed on the phone?
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:20.960]   Can be on the desktop?
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:26.000]   Can be here and where the value of creating a widget for your app just went up by like 300%.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000]   For safety, I think the check-in feature is great.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:30.480]   I have to.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:32.240]   So here's what's amazing about this.
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:34.320]   I was talking about as I always do,
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.120]   me use I used to be worried about you going into a ditch.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:37.680]   And so.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:38.720]   I made a shortcut.
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:38.880]   Actually.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.360]   You made a shortcut.
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:40.640]   Matthew made a shortcut.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.800]   For sharing your ETA, right?
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:44.640]   But here's the thing about sharing ETA.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.160]   I can see your dot and follow you along as you're going.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.280]   And when I think about people who are out in the world,
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:52.640]   they might be going places.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:53.680]   Maybe they're friends.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:56.160]   They don't feel comfortable sharing their exact location,
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.680]   but they would feel comfortable if in an emergency their location was shared.
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.880]   That's where check-in is different from what you have right now.
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:04.960]   Because check-in will keep everything private
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:07.760]   unless you're in a situation where you need to.
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:12.720]   At which point then it will share your location and information like how much battery life you have left.
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:14.800]   I think this is a fantastic feature.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:17.840]   We've seen a few third-party apps try to do something like this,
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:20.160]   but not quite succeed at this level.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:24.640]   So I can't wait for this to come out because I know that I would feel more comfortable
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:29.120]   using this with some folks where I wouldn't want to full on just give them my location.
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.080]   Yeah.
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:30.880]   That's a big deal.
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.160]   You just tell this feature.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:36.480]   I expect to be home by 4, by 9 p.m.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:37.520]   when that doesn't happen.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:40.320]   It will try to contact you if you don't respond.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.040]   The people that you've set up to be notified by this get, like Michael said,
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:49.600]   not just your location, but hey, here's your last time that you touch the phone.
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:52.800]   Here's your battery status, here's your cell phone status,
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:55.840]   here's your Apple Watch status so that you can get all this stuff together.
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.120]   One thing that I've asked Apple about this,
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:04.160]   I haven't got a response back is, I want to know what if one of your emergency contacts
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.800]   does not have an iPhone or does not have an iPhone that is running iOS 17,
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:14.080]   are they SOL or is it something where it will send an SMS,
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:20.000]   it sends out an SMS if it is received by the version of my message that runs an iOS 17,
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.680]   it gets redesigned as one of these beautiful graphical displays of what's going on
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:28.480]   because that would be quite a kick in the tee that they said,
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:32.560]   yeah, we don't want you to be rescued by anybody who has Android.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.960]   We feel so that's a good way to pressure that friend if they really want to save your life
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:39.520]   to have an iPhone. That is a good question.
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.800]   He's not scared. You would get an iPhone if you really cared.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.920]   Thank you, Scooterx, pointing out that little subtle thing, but Apple,
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:52.480]   which has always charged $99 to be in the developer program and required that you be in
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.360]   the developer program to use the developer betas, has now lifted that requirement.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.920]   So the free version, just sign in with your Apple ID,
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.240]   continues to give you Xcode and all of that, but you also get OS beta releases.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:04.800]   Oh, interesting.
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:08.240]   That's a new dot on the comparison list.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:11.840]   So thank you, Scooterx, for pointing to that.
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.280]   I think they should. That's great.
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.160]   Apple wants to get people on the bus.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.720]   You're either on the bus or you're off the bus.
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.560]   I have to say the thing I was most excited about are audio message transcriptions,
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.240]   because here's my problem.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:30.240]   I love sending audio transcriptions, but I hate receiving.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.240]   I have to listen to them.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.120]   Or audio messages.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:35.120]   Yeah, exactly. You have to listen to them.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.720]   I'm like, I don't want to type something out.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:38.000]   So I'll happily send.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.080]   So usually what I do is dictate it, but I think it's nice to have.
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.800]   I wonder if the Memoji audio will also be charged.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:47.840]   As podcasters, we're very happy to send our voice to people,
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:51.040]   but my little brother is notorious for setting me six minute long.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.320]   Oh, did the young student do that?
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.280]   Now I was wondering.
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:53.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.520]   And I don't want.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.960]   I'm usually doing something else.
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:57.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.320]   So I just want to be able to read it real quick and see, oh, that's what he wants.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.520]   I can respond super quick.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:06.400]   So I'm really whenever they announce that feature, I almost did a whoa.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.840]   But the audience sounds like they were fairly vocal.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:12.640]   So the press was mostly non vocal.
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:13.840]   As they should be.
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:14.640]   As we should be.
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:16.560]   And we were, you know, and so it's funny.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:19.840]   I was asking the question, what almost made you clap?
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:21.280]   Because that's kind of what you had to do.
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:23.680]   But ever the developers, of course, were very vocal.
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.480]   And then that section between where there was the apps, Apple folks,
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.520]   obviously very vocal.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:34.960]   But yeah, it was only on occasion where you'd get the sounds like the price of the vision.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:37.840]   A few jokes that came up.
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.080]   The name of that feature where you share your contact, the name drop feature.
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:44.560]   That got a lot of laughs that was called name drop.
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:49.360]   And then some of the stuff like a few of the stickers were funny to people.
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:51.040]   Good.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.240]   Yeah.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.000]   Uh, let's see.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.040]   What else do we have?
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.040]   Airdrop will let you.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.600]   That's the contact thing, I guess.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.840]   Well, but also I love this.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.680]   If I'm sharing a video with someone and I need to leave before I can.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:06.880]   Airdrop in the cloud.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:07.920]   Airdrop in the cloud.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:08.240]   Yeah.
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:08.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:12.640]   And I should also mention, since I'm here, if you want a more in depth look,
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:15.760]   Rosemary Orchard and I covered all iOS and iOS this morning.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:16.560]   I should have mentioned that.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:16.800]   Yeah.
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:17.280]   No.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.240]   We're just rehashing.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.880]   So that's where we're going to move very quickly.
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:27.200]   Uh, anything in the iPad, OS 17, you thought, uh, was worth.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:30.080]   I love it that we're going to have widgets on interactive widgets,
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:31.200]   which means we can.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:32.720]   And lockscreen customization.
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.280]   And lockscreen customization comes to the iPad.
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:39.360]   But yes, those interactive widgets, this is great on both iPhone and iPad because
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.880]   more and more we're getting to the state where we don't necessarily need to open up an app,
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.880]   wait for it to load or whatever happens to be and be able to access it.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:55.600]   That right there on my, it's almost like it's making it more Mac-like because my desktop is what
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:57.360]   I'm looking at instead of a home screen.
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:57.600]   Right.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.280]   And I can interact with these little things.
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.240]   And I mean, I.
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.360]   That's how it should be.
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.360]   And I'm sure Rosemary, I mentioned her name was very excited that she could put shortcuts
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:06.080]   in the widgets on the desktop.
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:07.360]   Oh, 100%.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:08.400]   Excited about that.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.840]   Unfortunately, that's another thing that's not working right now at iOS.
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:13.760]   So her shortcuts app won't even open.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.640]   Ah.
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:15.680]   So she's waiting for that.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.440]   Notes is getting much more.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.240]   Go ahead, Candy.
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:18.480]   Yes.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:22.080]   What one really big thing that we that I really, really want for a long time,
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.960]   iOS iPad, iOS 17, now supports external cameras.
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.760]   So you can plug in a webcam and actually use it.
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:28.320]   Really?
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.080]   I don't think that's great.
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:30.560]   Absolutely.
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:35.360]   It was it was in the state of the union yesterday and I've also seen other people talking about it.
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.760]   I face time on my iPad almost all the time.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:41.760]   And it's really weird because it's sideways and that the camera is over there.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:42.880]   So I'm never looking at the camera.
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:45.200]   So an external camera would be very nice.
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:49.280]   When I'm traveling on a Tuesday, that's the only reason why I have to take my damn
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.120]   like MacBook with it instead of just one iPad.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:52.960]   Yeah, I can actually take this on my external.
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:53.440]   Yeah.
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.840]   Health comes to the iPad.
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:58.960]   We mentioned that much improved PDF features.
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:01.120]   I mean, basically you won't need a third party PDF.
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:04.640]   I feel kind of feeling for a lot of those third party apps.
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:07.600]   And notes is really they keep improving notes.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:08.960]   Notes is getting better and better.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:11.120]   Trying to make it a little bit more like these tools,
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.120]   what logs stack and a few others.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:17.040]   PKM tools, they call them personal knowledge management tools.
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:18.320]   You know what they didn't do a lot of?
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:20.560]   I've been stage manager.
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:23.520]   Yeah, they just said, "I've got a few improvements."
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:28.160]   I will say, so Christopher Lawley, who has been a guest on iOS today,
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:31.040]   and is like the stage manager guru.
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:36.000]   He nearly stood whenever they said he made improvements to stage manager.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.040]   Whatever a lot of people are griping about who use stage manager,
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.640]   one of the things is sort of whenever you take a window and you try to move it around,
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:44.720]   it would sort of jostle everything around the place.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:46.160]   They fixed that.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.200]   So that was exciting.
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.560]   I forgot to mention in notes when we were talking about the logsec thing.
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:54.880]   One thing that they didn't announce, I believe on stage,
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.440]   but was in the little details is that you can link between notes.
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:01.280]   So one note can link to another one.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.360]   And that's really that personal knowledge.
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:03.680]   Yeah.
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:04.240]   Yeah.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:04.880]   Yeah.
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:08.400]   Notes, it's too bad it's not cross platform.
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:08.720]   Yeah.
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:11.520]   That's the biggest downside to that.
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.520]   But if you live in the Apple ecosystem.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:16.320]   I guess technically because you can access it in the web.
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:16.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:17.840]   That was the last one.
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:17.840]   Yeah.
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:18.320]   Yeah.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:23.120]   I've actually got grab notes when I need to go to PC and logged into iCloud to grab onto it.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:23.920]   Oh, OK.
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:24.320]   Good.
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:25.280]   I don't think it very often.
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:30.320]   But it notes it for those of us who are mostly 99% dealing with the Mac,
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:31.520]   it is super powerful.
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:32.480]   Like it, I use it.
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:33.360]   It's like, yeah.
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:33.920]   Thanks for all the time.
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:38.400]   Emoryk is saying classical music for iPad is now in the App Store.
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:38.960]   Oh, good.
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:39.840]   Yeah.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:40.880]   Andy and I are happy.
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:41.520]   Yeah.
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:44.560]   Biggest news of the whole event.
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:45.520]   Yes.
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:46.800]   Mac OS.
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:49.760]   Sonoma.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.560]   We are probably unjustifiably excited about that because we are in fact in Sonoma County.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:59.120]   I was so excited and I was thinking about you all and I thought I bet they're very pumped to hear that.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.080]   So excited.
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:03.840]   People were kind of poo poo-ing it where I was and I thought, hey, listen.
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:09.440]   The way they led up to it, you know, Craig Federighi did his dad jokes about his crack team and all that.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:12.880]   But the way they led up to it said they were going to wine country and I thought, oh crap,
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:14.000]   they're going to name it Napa.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.040]   Oh, for some reason from the beginning, I thought it's Sonoma.
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.320]   So I was really excited.
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:21.200]   Napa gets all the press, all the attention.
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:24.480]   And here we are in Little Ol Sonoma Valley just next door.
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:28.320]   So I was very pleased that Apple gave us that and our wine is better.
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:32.400]   Other things in Sonoma, I like that name.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.280]   Screensavers.
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:41.280]   Did people laugh? People said rest in peace, Ariel, because I don't know if you all know that's the
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:42.720]   stuff that I'm sure I'm back.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:45.040]   Which basically did this.
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:46.000]   The TVOS.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.360]   This is even better though because they apparently added a bunch of new wallpapers,
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.360]   all of which become alive.
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:55.200]   And that's the thing is that they turn into your wallpaper, which is, yeah, it goes,
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.040]   yeah, from the lock screen to the wallpaper, exactly.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:57.600]   I love that.
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:00.880]   They have a bunch of stuff for Safari, who cares?
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:04.800]   Oh, OK, but profiles in Safari, I think is actually kind of neat.
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:05.680]   That's why you're here.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:06.480]   This is why I'm here.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.720]   I don't know if you folks feel that way, but I, so I'm a Safari user.
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.640]   And that's one of the things that I did like about Chrome and about a few other browsers that
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:17.280]   exist out there are switching between profiles.
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:18.400]   So I was excited about it.
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:18.400]   Yeah.
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.360]   Yeah.
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.840]   They're also doing sharing of the logins and passwords.
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:25.040]   So if you have a family that all uses the same Netflix package,
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:26.960]   you don't have to basically sync between them.
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.960]   That makes Apple Keychain is getting closer and closer to full fledged password manager.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:35.760]   That's one of the last things that was still missing is the ability to share.
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:38.640]   That's actually quite huge.
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:40.560]   I will use that because Lisa is on a Mac.
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:41.200]   I'm on a Mac.
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.680]   She's still using LastPass.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:44.640]   I'm using Bitwarden.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:48.160]   So I can't share through our password manager, but we both have Mac.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:49.520]   So I can share through Keychain.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.000]   Yes.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:50.480]   That's--
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:54.240]   They're doing something similar with the FindMyNetwork.
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:58.880]   Like, but you can have an air tag that can be found by multiple people in your family
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:02.560]   or in your group, which is nice because, OK, that's great.
[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:06.320]   Because maybe you and your spouse are equally invested in finding out where your suitcase
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:07.120]   wound it up.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:11.600]   But it's like if there is a warning when you activate it and say, OK, by the way,
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:16.320]   that means that if a family member has put one of these tags with you without your
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:19.360]   knowledge, it's not going to alert you that there's an air tag following you because
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:20.400]   this is your air tag.
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:23.120]   So make sure that you're not in a stocky sort of situation.
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:25.600]   But that's unavoidable, I suppose.
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:27.760]   We were talking about that on Twitter on Sunday.
[02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:31.280]   A lot of spouses turn the FindMyOn.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.400]   Lisa and I have it on.
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:33.840]   So I know she's delayed.
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:34.480]   She's still--
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:34.880]   I could look--
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:35.680]   She's not in a ditch.
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:37.600]   She's still working on it to start dinner or whatever.
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:42.400]   Those, I think, if you trust your spouse and you're not worried about them talking you,
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:44.560]   I think that's a good safety feature.
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:48.000]   And actually, Apple has really enhanced that to some degree, which is great.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.520]   But I agree with you.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:51.920]   Only do it if you really trust the other person.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:55.200]   You do have, let's see, web apps.
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:58.480]   Now, this was one safari thing that I wanted to know more about.
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:01.520]   And in fact, I'll have to watch the track on this because
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:07.360]   Apple's been laggard on progressive web apps, which is a standard from Google and Microsoft.
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:13.200]   And without safari participating fully, PWA was kind of DOA.
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:19.200]   It sounds like Apple is now turning it on, but they didn't say PWA.
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:25.920]   So I'm not sure if it's an Apple feature, a safari thing that's not progressive web apps or what.
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:31.200]   I don't know. It hooks up nicely with the feature where now if you have a website that is a web app,
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:33.600]   you can now actually have it as an app in the dock.
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:34.960]   Yep. And notifications.
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:35.600]   And notifications.
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:38.720]   So they're clearly providing some services.
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:41.440]   I'm going to have to look into it in more detail.
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:44.960]   It really does feel like what you can do on iOS just brought to macOS,
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.440]   which is essentially wrapping it in its own window.
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:49.600]   Yeah, that's not so special, frankly.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:50.800]   That's not progressive web apps.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:53.600]   But the fact that you can do notifications, I don't know, maybe we'll see.
[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:55.280]   Yeah, they brought the iOS first.
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:56.720]   Right. With notifications.
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:59.280]   Live stickers also come to macOS.
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:02.640]   Yeah. Sorry.
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:04.480]   Yeah. I guess so.
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:13.360]   macOS is compatible with 2019 iMacs and later 2019 Mac Pros and later 2017 iMac Pros and later.
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:16.160]   Mac Studios, obviously.
[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:18.400]   The MacBook Air from 2018 or later.
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.080]   So it has to be a fairly recent air.
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:24.320]   Looks like, in fact, do you have to have Apple Silicon?
[02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:25.680]   I'm wondering now.
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.040]   Mac Mini 2018 or later MacBook Pro 2018 or later.
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:33.200]   So a lot of older hardware now left in the dust when it comes to a Sonoma.
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.840]   Anything such continues to cross them already.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.520]   Well, if you want to run game mode, then you obviously need a newer machine.
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:40.880]   Yeah. Game mode.
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:41.600]   Ooh.
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:46.160]   It's not only game mode, but they're also for developers.
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:51.120]   They've actually added a whole suite of tools for converting Windows games to Mac.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:53.360]   And it's really, really quite a rich environment.
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:54.360]   Yeah.
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:57.920]   Christina was talking about that and I thought it was very interesting.
[02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:04.560]   They have effectively released DirectX 12 emulation for the Mac.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:10.960]   Now they say it's a way for game developers to evaluate whether they can port their game
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.240]   to metal.
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:16.480]   But in fact, they are using crossover or wine.
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:21.200]   They're actually contributing to an open source project,
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:25.600]   but in a weird backhanded way through homebrew, the ability to run
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:31.600]   DirectX 12 games in emulation on a Mac, that's very, to me, that's very interesting.
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:34.960]   Christina Warren noticed it and started posting it.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:41.040]   Here's an actual video as Apple hid something amazing for Mac gaming at WWDC.
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:48.480]   And so Apple was actually showing Windows games running in Rosetta in DirectX 12.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:50.480]   What?
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:52.880]   So it's a pretty big deal.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:56.640]   It'll convert your renders, it'll convert your shaders.
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.240]   It's ambitious.
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:02.160]   So let's see if Windows game developers fall for it.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:09.840]   I will actually give credit to the great Andrew Sye, who noticed that he is an Apple developer,
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:12.720]   developed SpamSiv, which is a great game.
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:13.280]   Oh, okay.
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:13.760]   Wow.
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:15.200]   Tools, I think it's that Andrew Sye.
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:19.520]   So his video discovering this is a big deal.
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.040]   And I think it's very interesting.
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:24.720]   I suspect we'll see some open source crossover on this.
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:31.360]   This was huge for Linux when the Steam Deck supported Proton for cross compatibility.
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.560]   Suddenly, all these Windows games ran beautifully on Linux.
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.680]   And I think this could be actually huge for Apple Silicon.
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:42.160]   As somebody who likes to play games, I'm...
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.920]   This excites me too.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:46.160]   If it likes to play games, it has a Mac studio.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:46.560]   Right.
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:46.960]   You mean?
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:47.120]   Right.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:47.840]   It'd be great.
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:48.640]   And a nice screen.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:50.480]   Let's see.
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:51.200]   They talked about...
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:51.840]   Oh, no.
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:57.600]   In Mac OS as well, you can finally, with both the studio display or the iPhone,
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.400]   actually control the composition when you're using that center stage feature.
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:05.520]   Finally, Jason Snell, when you heard this.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:06.000]   You can tell him.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:06.800]   Laurie Hallelujah.
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.200]   You can say look to your left, look to your right.
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:11.440]   You can choose how the zoom and pan happens before.
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:15.200]   It was just automatic to try to re-center you, but it sometimes kind of odd.
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.200]   So now you can choose between wide and older wide.
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:25.120]   Maybe they did that because they also showed how you can do face time on your Apple TV using continuity cam.
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:28.000]   That feature I'm so excited about.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.280]   Ever since I moved here, everything's giving in Christmas.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.520]   I do this strange iPad dance with my family back home who only have iPhones.
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.160]   So they're trying to hold an iPhone and pass it around.
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:43.200]   And I'm getting sick looking at the iPad as they're passing it around.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:47.920]   So the idea of, of course, it'll be, it'll require a little support call to get them to get it set up.
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:53.600]   But once that's done, we'll be able to have them up on the screen as we sort of celebrate our Christmas from a distance.
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:57.680]   I FaceTime my mom every week and I could put her on our big screen in the living room.
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.320]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:02.160]   And have the camera over by the kitchen and we can have Thanksgiving?
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.320]   And there's a session.
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:05.040]   This is exciting.
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:11.120]   There's a session at WWDC right now talking about using something called DocKit
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:17.840]   that will let developers interact with motorized docs for the iPhone.
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:18.720]   So what we're thinking is-
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:20.400]   Oh, I have one of those motorized docs.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.800]   Uh-huh. So you walk your iPhone onto this MagSafe doc and then you can FaceTime
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:29.600]   from the television and the doc can move with you as you're moving around your space.
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:30.560]   Okay.
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:36.400]   I see something here in video conferencing called a bubble overlay, although I wrote
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.440]   bubble loverlay.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:39.280]   And I think that was Freudian.
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:40.000]   I know.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.080]   The bubble loverlay is-
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:43.360]   I don't know what that is.
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.600]   I'm kind of annoyed by this because they took this from iOS today.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:48.640]   No, I can't-
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:49.520]   It was your idea.
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:52.960]   Rosemary Orchard and I, when we do our show in the morning, we have-
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:53.600]   You have a bubble overlay.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.000]   Overlay.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:54.000]   Overlay.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:54.720]   Yeah.
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:55.600]   Uh-
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.280]   Off and overlaid over the iPad so that we can show what's on the screen but also still appear on the screen.
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:05.120]   Apple's being a little bit more clever because it's using a lot of the features,
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:09.120]   the true depth and everything to kind of cut you out so you're almost overlaid a little-
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:13.040]   They showed like your full size with your power point or your uh,
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:14.640]   keynote, sorry, behind you.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:17.520]   And then that's the other thing is that yeah, you can go from this small bubble overlay.
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:18.000]   I loved that.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.600]   Or sorry bubble loverlay.
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:24.000]   To the bigger version that yeah has these multiple layers and in macOS,
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:30.880]   there's going to be a new uh, picker option that lets you choose specific apps that you want to show
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:32.880]   in third party conferencing apps.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:38.480]   So instead of using zoom itself to say, I want to show just this window or I want to show just
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:44.960]   this app, you can go into the little green plus icon and say, show this app or like Safari or this
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:48.960]   window in zoom and then use my bubble overlay, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:53.040]   This was part of a segment they called audio and home, which was a little weird.
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:54.960]   It was like, we can all these loose pieces.
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:55.120]   Yeah.
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:56.800]   Where do we put them in there?
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:59.920]   But there was one that I thought was really interesting.
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:02.000]   I've kind of come around on the AirPods Pro.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.840]   They're more comfortable.
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:05.200]   They actually sound really good.
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:11.440]   And Kevin Tofel, who does the IoT show with Stacey Higginbotham,
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.360]   talked about how he uses them as kind of air that's hearing aids.
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.040]   Now, Apple, we thought for a long time was probably interested in this category,
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:22.000]   especially now that over the counter hearing aids are legal.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.360]   They talked about something with their AirPods that I think really is exactly what hearing aid
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:30.160]   users want.
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.600]   They call it adaptive audio.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:35.040]   They've always had noise canceling and they've always had
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:36.480]   transparency.
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:39.200]   Now, it'll slide between them.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:42.560]   So I'm walking down the street and there's a jackhammer.
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:43.920]   It'll turn down the sound.
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:48.720]   But even more importantly, you come up and say, hi, it will turn down the background
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:50.640]   and focus the sound on you.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:52.880]   That's what you want a hearing aid to do.
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:55.360]   Hearing aids are all about intelligibility of speech.
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:59.200]   I think this is, I can't wait to use this.
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:04.000]   I think this might be, and what Apple, it really looked like is trying to get everybody to do
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.640]   is where your AirPods all turn.
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.320]   Yeah, you can wear them more often.
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:09.680]   And then on top of those.
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:10.720]   You're a chance of losing them.
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:18.160]   On top of those features, also understanding the behavior of when I listen to podcasts,
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:19.920]   I typically have my volume here.
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:21.600]   When I watch movies, my volume's here.
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:23.600]   When I listen to Beyonce, it's here.
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:26.960]   Whenever I listen to the strokes, it's here.
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:32.000]   And then be able to move between those different volumes automatically.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.400]   Does it know that from location?
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:35.360]   Those are from behavior.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:36.240]   Of course, the content.
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:37.600]   Yeah, depending on the content.
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:38.320]   That's very cool.
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:41.840]   Your memories can now be a screensaver on your Apple TV.
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:42.720]   I'll be using that.
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:47.600]   I am actually very excited about that, except I already can imagine.
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:48.720]   Yeah, well, it could go away.
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:49.840]   It depends what you remember.
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:51.600]   You just want to be careful what you remember.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:56.640]   Don't, whatever, don't turn your bubble lover away into a memory.
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:00.320]   Because you're going to have, keep your bubble lover away to your problems.
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:00.560]   Yes.
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:01.360]   Yes.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:03.520]   I'll locate Siri remote.
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:10.800]   This is halfway between what we want and what we need.
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:12.880]   Between what we want.
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:14.000]   How was that in the remote?
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.520]   And we weren't given that earlier.
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:17.200]   Like, you had that and you could.
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.240]   Yeah, I wonder why.
[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:24.240]   So the idea is you apparently they have a UWB chip in the Apple TV remote we never knew about.
[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:27.040]   Because you can now aim your phone and say, okay, but let me be clear.
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:29.920]   This is my understanding from speaking with a few folks.
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.240]   Is that it's not using a UWB instead.
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:39.200]   It is because of the advances in Bluetooth.
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:44.240]   It's a little bit better at determining the signal of the Bluetooth and using that.
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:45.360]   It doesn't do an arrow.
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:52.480]   I thought maybe they were having the remote image emitted in audible high pitch scream.
[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:59.120]   The bubble gets bigger or smaller, but there's no arrow, unfortunately.
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:01.440]   Oh, okay.
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:03.600]   So it's closer or farther.
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:04.000]   Okay.
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:04.800]   So that would make sense.
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:05.840]   Bluetooth strength.
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:06.240]   Yeah.
[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:06.240]   Yeah.
[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:06.720]   Yeah.
[02:31:06.720 --> 02:31:08.720]   I wish it was more than that, but unfortunately it's not.
[02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:15.360]   And then the great savior of relationships everywhere is that you and whomever is in your
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:16.720]   vehicle that you're allowing to.
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:18.240]   This is going to cause problems.
[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:18.880]   But okay.
[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:23.360]   So I actually asked about this because I thought this is share play with the car play.
[02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:24.160]   Share play in the car.
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:24.400]   Yeah.
[02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:27.040]   And I thought this has got to be off.
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:29.840]   So that somebody in the backseat can change the music.
[02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:30.720]   If you allow them to.
[02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:31.760]   But you have to allow them to.
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:37.760]   And this is why I like this is because I'll tell us, I'll talk about how it works for me
[02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:42.720]   right now, which is if I'm in the passenger seat, my partner's driving and there's a song
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:43.840]   I'd love to listen to.
[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:47.040]   I say, can I please, please, please, please, please add a song to the queue.
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:47.920]   And he says, okay.
[02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:48.560]   And I say, okay.
[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:52.960]   Well, and then I hold up his phone to his face while he's driving just to the side so it unlocks
[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:54.800]   and I can add a song to the queue.
[02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:56.400]   Now I can just do it on my own phone.
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:03.760]   And interestingly, only the person who is connected to car play needs to have an Apple
[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:04.800]   music subscription.
[02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:05.280]   Oh.
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:08.640]   So you can still DJ even if you don't.
[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.280]   I'm driving.
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:11.440]   Lisa's in the passenger seat.
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:13.360]   It's my phone that's playing music.
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:17.920]   What we've always done in the past is she's had a pair, you know, we switched the car play
[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:23.440]   over to her, but now she could just share play over to my phone and play her crappy lady Gaga music.
[02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:24.400]   Or just add to the queue.
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:24.880]   Okay.
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:26.000]   You know, so temporary.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:26.640]   Yeah.
[02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:27.520]   I'm kidding.
[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:28.480]   She likes Beyonce.
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:31.360]   That's TVOS 17.
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:34.080]   That's watch OS, whatever 10, I think.
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.680]   Some new features in watch OS.
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:37.040]   Snoopy.
[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:38.800]   Snoopy in the Woodstock.
[02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:39.280]   So good.
[02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:40.800]   I just got to point out.
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:41.360]   That's fine.
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:46.720]   That Charles Schulz, Peanuts, Santa Rosa, Sonoma County.
[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:49.840]   There's somebody's been a lot of time up here now on the Apple team.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:54.160]   I just want to say I'm thinking Greg Federighi's got a palace up here or something.
[02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:56.400]   And always like a Peanuts.
[02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:58.560]   Curb your, curb your enthusiast for kids.
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:00.080]   Isn't it?
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:01.680]   I never thought of that.
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:05.120]   Oh, oh, Snoopy.
[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:08.400]   The football thing.
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:08.560]   Yeah.
[02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:12.640]   No, you know, Lucy is absolutely.
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:19.680]   Larry David, you now have, if you play tennis or golf, your watch, it's on your wrist.
[02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:21.040]   Well, notice how you're swinging.
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:25.520]   There's features for cyclists, which that was pretty intense.
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:28.400]   I mean, I was really curious about that.
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.960]   That I think that there's a lot, if it's really accurate,
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:36.800]   the amount of data that you're getting for sports is serious.
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:38.480]   Cyclists already have this.
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:42.240]   They already have a dashboard and Garmin watch and they're already doing all of this.
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:43.680]   But yeah, if you're not a serious.
[02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:44.640]   You're in between her.
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:45.120]   Yeah.
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:46.400]   You're getting something new.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:46.480]   Yeah.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:46.960]   Yeah.
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:47.520]   Yeah.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:54.480]   I was really excited about the two hiking things, topographic maps coming to maps on Apple Watch.
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:55.760]   That's really cool.
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:58.320]   So you'll know what the altitude is before you go there.
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:33:59.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:02.560]   And be, I think that it's helpful in trying to determine, I know I got lost,
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:03.600]   but how do I get back?
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:09.600]   And that's paired with the new wayfinder points so that it will tell you to leave breadcrumbs.
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:10.000]   Exactly.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.480]   The last time you had a cellular connection and then not only just the last time you had a
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:19.680]   cellular connection on your cellular service, but then it'll add a second waypoint that is the
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:26.000]   last time you had the availability to place an emergency call, which is available on any carrier.
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:30.640]   So even if your carrier doesn't reach as far, obviously you can place an emergency call on any
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:30.960]   carrier.
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.480]   So it'll show you that waypoint as well.
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:33.280]   I thought that was awesome.
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:33.600]   Nice.
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:36.960]   So benefits to hikers, bikers.
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:40.240]   Oh, and then widgets are glances kind of on watch.
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:42.080]   They brought glances back really.
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.080]   So that you can now, if you start a timer, you can scroll up and you'll see the timer and so
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:46.320]   forth.
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:48.800]   I think that's a huge step forward.
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:49.120]   Yeah.
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:50.560]   Exactly what I want to use that one.
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:50.960]   Exactly.
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:52.320]   A little better than glances.
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.240]   Because again, we don't want to hold our arms up all day.
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:54.480]   Right.
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:55.600]   Yeah.
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:57.440]   They have brought mental health to the watch.
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:34:58.880]   It's about time.
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:00.000]   Yeah.
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.760]   More than they have in the past, at least, there's just some new kind of,
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.960]   I would say it's almost just more new categories for what was all one,
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:11.280]   just sort of categorizing their mindfulness.
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:11.920]   Be grateful.
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:12.560]   That's all.
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:13.360]   Got gratitude.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.160]   And that's the part of the feature that says,
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:18.960]   you've only been outside for 30 minutes.
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:21.760]   You need to go outside for another 90 minutes or something.
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:24.480]   I did like how they broke that down.
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:28.560]   I did not realize that being in sunlight was helpful.
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:29.840]   Oh, you didn't know that?
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:30.480]   I hope you didn't know.
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:32.880]   I knew obviously the change in vision.
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:34.240]   And I knew looking out.
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.200]   They've always said that.
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:37.200]   You should look at a variety of focal lengths.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:38.400]   But yeah, I did not realize.
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:42.320]   Glue to screens or wearing helmets should really get out there and look at the mountains.
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.360]   Yeah.
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.600]   I mean, my, myopia is largely hereditary.
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:50.000]   But the thing that is not hereditary that's connected to those screens
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.320]   that they didn't talk about was macular degeneration.
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:56.240]   And that is what a lot of people are really worried about related to our screens.
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:59.040]   That's why a lot of people turn their screens in night mode all the time on,
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:00.800]   unless they want to watch something that they care about.
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:02.480]   And it's why.
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:03.440]   So tell me that.
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:04.480]   No one wants to talk about that.
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.480]   The brightness of the screen that's in it.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:07.920]   It's the blue light.
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:11.920]   It's the, it's the, it's the, it is, there's a, when you have it,
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:12.320]   when you're in a dark area.
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:14.240]   Because I'm in the macular degeneration zone.
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:16.960]   There are a number of new studies about blue lights damage too.
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:16.960]   Yeah.
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.840]   And of course these screens all have a lot of blue light, more than, more than some.
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.760]   Odd that everyone started moving to dark mode.
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:24.320]   Yeah.
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:25.680]   And everybody started, you know, having these things.
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:29.760]   And then no one wants to talk about the fact that macular, I had a long discussion
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.600]   like a problem optimally just about it.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:32.560]   Oh, very interested.
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:33.040]   Yeah.
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.160]   And they were like, yeah, that thing we're worried about is the macular degeneration,
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:39.200]   which, you know, yeah, which you and I need to get checked on.
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.000]   Right.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.520]   Although I have heard you can exacerbate myopia, kids who read a lot and things like that,
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:47.520]   can make myopia worse.
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:48.400]   That's just near sight.
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:50.400]   See, see, we have a whole theory.
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:53.440]   We, Trey Radcliffe and I were trading notes on this on, on Twitter.
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:56.080]   We have a whole theory that, you know, you know, a couple hundred years ago,
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.520]   you were just mostly blind.
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:58.000]   Right.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:59.120]   Like if you were, yeah.
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:01.360]   So you had to be very, you had to be very crafty.
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:02.560]   That's why we're smart.
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:03.280]   Yeah.
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.520]   We had to be very crafty because we're the only ones that survived.
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:06.960]   We were the ones that succeed very well.
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:08.080]   We like we had to be a teacher.
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:09.920]   That's our whole theory that I want.
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.880]   The watch will support name drop, which I think is really cool.
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:13.280]   That's a mention.
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:13.440]   Yeah.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:15.920]   I can come up to you and we can do our watch.
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:17.520]   It's a watch bump instead of a fist bump.
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:18.400]   A watch bump.
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:19.680]   That might be the new thing.
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:21.120]   So watch it was.
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:22.640]   It was activated by fist bump.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.400]   That would be so cool.
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:29.520]   I mean, there was many years ago at CES, IBM had a technology.
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:31.200]   They put a computer in your shoe.
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:33.360]   And then use its capacitance.
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.320]   Can you take somebody?
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.680]   No, you would shake hands and in the capacitance and the contact.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:40.000]   Wait, you had to run a wire all the way down to your shoe.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:40.720]   I don't know how it worked.
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:44.640]   But you would shake hands with somebody else wearing the IBM foot shoe.
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:45.040]   Right.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:45.600]   Not the shoe.
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:46.160]   Yeah.
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:47.520]   The foot shoe.
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:48.720]   Shake their hands.
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:51.600]   And a bubble lover light would appear over your head.
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:52.000]   No.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.440]   And you would exchange a business.
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:54.720]   I love it.
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:55.600]   It's ridiculous.
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:56.880]   Let's make it again.
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:59.280]   Well, they were trying to and this is this is it.
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:01.120]   Only right done right.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:02.160]   Again, Apple.
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:02.640]   Good job.
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:05.920]   What were you saying, Andy?
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:10.240]   Oh, no, I was just going to say that the lockdown mode, since we're talking about watch
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.680]   it was locked down mode now also extends to watch to watch it was.
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:17.120]   So you can block if you locked down your phone, you can also lock down your watch as well.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.560]   So again, if you feel as though you're being targeted by like natural
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.920]   national surveillance agency and that your your phone or devices are being hacked to get
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:27.920]   access to your messages and contacts and stuff like that,
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:30.480]   the watch used to be vulnerable to that now.
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:33.920]   We the exact same lockdown mode that goes into the phone now applies to the watch.
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:37.440]   And it's all yeah, it's on Mac OS and everywhere.
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:38.720]   I think I'm getting a punchy.
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:40.400]   I think is there any.
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:46.160]   Did you hear something that was no, I said foot shoe and then shoe computer.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:53.280]   Well, I believe all shoes are designed to go on your feet.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.400]   I might be wrong on that.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:56.320]   A hot shoe doesn't go on your show.
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:56.800]   Oh, shoot that.
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:58.800]   Put you.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.200]   What's your question mark?
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:02.160]   What am I talking about?
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:04.400]   Does anybody have anything else?
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:05.360]   I mean, this was a lot.
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:07.840]   There was a two hour and six minute presentation.
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:11.440]   We've gone almost the same amount of time, actually a little longer.
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:12.800]   Anything we've missed.
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:17.120]   I think if there's anything really that stuck out to me or that I heard about after or.
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:22.400]   I you know, this this was one of those events where and we really didn't expect this apple
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:24.400]   updates almost all their Mac hardware.
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:26.800]   We really didn't expect something like that.
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:27.200]   Yeah.
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.560]   In fact, there was a lot of conversation.
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:29.840]   You know what leading into it.
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.800]   I was having with the other folks about how.
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:36.960]   Oh man, if apple takes the time to announce all of these Macs,
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:39.440]   it's all going to be overshadowed by the headset.
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:40.720]   So why would they.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:42.000]   It is to do somewhat.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:42.560]   Yeah.
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:44.080]   We mostly talked about the headset.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:45.360]   A lot of people are mostly talking about it.
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:45.760]   Yeah.
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.960]   So it was kind of interesting that they still chose to announce the Macs here
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:54.320]   as opposed to just doing one of those press release and send out the review units.
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:59.200]   Somebody's in the chat room said don't forget your autocorrects not going to duck you anymore.
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:00.000]   Because of new.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:00.000]   Yeah.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:06.240]   I was just about to say I was just about to say I'm I'm amazed that there's so many like
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:07.760]   pieces written about this.
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:12.560]   I was on WGN radio in Chicago this morning and the host said so I understand that now
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:16.720]   I can cuss on on Iowans on my iPhone and I'm like, say what?
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:22.800]   Think about what do you what do you think you can always cusses on CNN.
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:26.880]   The iPhones ducking autocorrects problem finally gets fixed.
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:27.760]   The problem.
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:30.800]   So can I type the other word now?
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:35.280]   I mean, it means that now it's it's better at like remembering that oh you tend to use
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:35.920]   this word a lot.
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:37.440]   So I'm not going to autocorrect this one.
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:38.560]   This is not my dictionary.
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:44.000]   It's again, it's a Logan Roy will say the improved autocorrect based on a transformer machine
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:44.720]   language model.
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:45.440]   Yeah.
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:50.640]   And it's arguably less prudish because even if you there were a bunch of ways that you could
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:54.720]   try to get it to do it in the past so that it would just leave you alone and it wouldn't.
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.960]   And now in the change to the transformative model.
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:40:59.360]   All right.
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:40:59.360]   All right.
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:03.040]   And any any guesses as to which Apple executive demanded that?
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:04.160]   No, I can imagine.
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:06.720]   I can ducking imagine.
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:09.840]   Anything else we've missed.
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.760]   It was it was it was I thought a very interesting event.
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:16.800]   I was so glad not to hear the letters 5G or AI.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:17.440]   Oh my god.
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:17.920]   5G.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:18.880]   Anywhere in it.
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:21.280]   There was a lot of AI in it.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.840]   Large language models, machine learning, but but not AI specifically.
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:29.680]   And I think it's interesting that where the rest of the industry has turned away.
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:33.920]   From VR and AR, you know, look at meta.
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:34.720]   They went wood.
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:37.920]   There's like that's that meme with the guy going by with the girl.
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:41.440]   And and Apple is, you know, keeping their eyes.
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:42.560]   Surprise.
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.320]   They're sticking with the one the problem.
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:49.200]   This is, you know, both both of these both Google and Apple like like seven five six seven
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:50.400]   years ago said, you know what?
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.760]   We're going to we think that this thing that we're going to invest on a
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:58.640]   cajillion dollars and is going to be like the lifeblood of the company in the 20 in the in the
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:00.400]   2020s and 2030s.
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:03.120]   And one of these people is probably going to be right.
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:06.320]   And we're we shouldn't we shouldn't guess that it's going to be Google.
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:07.840]   We shouldn't guess it's going to be Apple.
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:08.960]   But oh my god.
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.160]   So we I feel as though both of these companies cannot have made the exact same right decision though.
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:20.960]   If you think I was critical of the vision pro, you ought to hear me talk about AI.
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:23.120]   We do.
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.960]   I'm turning into a devorac actually, I think I'm just negative on everything.
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:30.080]   I don't think either one is going to change the world, but we'll see.
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:30.400]   We'll see.
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:36.880]   As someone as an Andy and Otco again, I get a lot of emails like, oh, are you being personal
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:37.360]   about me?
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:41.120]   Or you're saying AI not as much not as big a deal as I like you AI.
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:42.800]   You're the good AI.
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:44.800]   Thank you very much.
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:49.600]   I probably am not going to turn against humanity and be the destruction of all that is good
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:52.640]   and hold on this plan, but don't give them the new clear codes anyway.
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:55.760]   Just just just don't don't don't don't be mean.
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:56.160]   Okay.
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:58.720]   I mean, I some days I'm just right there in the edge.
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.040]   You could I mean, I'm right there.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:01.680]   It's going to blow.
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:02.160]   You know what I mean?
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:02.800]   It's going to blow.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:09.200]   Alex, anything final thoughts you you you obviously were very excited about everything you saw
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:10.080]   yesterday.
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:10.480]   I think it was.
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:13.360]   Solid updates for the stuff that we expected.
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:18.560]   I think that the headset is actually more than I expected, you know, from from a version one.
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:21.120]   So I think that it's it's got some pretty good it's got some legs.
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:25.840]   So I'm looking forward to to the to the fall or the, you know, it's good.
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:26.080]   Yeah.
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:28.960]   I'm very excited about my 15 inch.
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:30.880]   I'm excited.
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:31.360]   I'm excited for you.
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:32.000]   You said it for you.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.520]   I can't wait to get that.
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:41.280]   Andy, it sounds like you were reasonably approving of everything.
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:41.840]   Very much.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:45.360]   Oh, in in once in one, maybe verbose sentence.
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:50.560]   I I wasn't prepared to judge it based on anything that Apple was going to show off today.
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:53.360]   However, I don't think they made any huge mistakes.
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:44:02.400]   I think to the extent to which a virtual reality ski goggle type headset can succeed in 2024 2025.
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:04.560]   I think they've set themselves up nicely.
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:08.640]   But again, we're going to find out in January, February what they're actually delivering
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:10.080]   and what the experience is actually like.
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:10.240]   Yeah.
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:14.080]   But again, I don't nothing nothing that can rag on them about not that I was not that I was saying
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:15.040]   them up for that.
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:17.920]   But I think that that was very, very pleased with yesterday's announcement.
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:19.760]   Micah, you're glad you were there.
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:25.040]   Glad to have been there for the things I learned and sort of post keynotes.
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.280]   And more importantly, just very excited to dig into these developer sessions and learn more.
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:29.600]   Yeah.
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:31.520]   That's where the of it is going to be.
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:32.000]   I agree.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.040]   There are a lot of sessions I've been eyeball and I got to see more about that.
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.240]   So yeah, you'll hear more about that soon.
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:38.960]   Good.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:39.200]   Yeah.
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:39.840]   Yeah.
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:45.520]   Godspeed because I don't think I'll be able to get through all of those.
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:47.840]   But I'm glad you're, you know, the young people today.
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:48.560]   That's what we're here for.
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:49.200]   They got the energy.
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:50.800]   We're going to take a break.
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:53.760]   Come back with your fix of the week in just a second.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:55.920]   I showed today brought to you by Melissa.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:56.800]   Melissa.
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:02.400]   Oh, I've talked about them before the address experts, the leader in global data quality,
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:07.360]   identity verification and address management solutions.
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:12.240]   Actually, some, you know, good news a little pat on the back, Melissa, because they just,
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:18.400]   the clean suite and data quality suite from Melissa have just once again been named leader by G2,
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:25.200]   which is a leader itself in peer-to-peer software in the 2023 data quality and address
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:26.880]   verification spring report.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:28.640]   Good going.
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:33.360]   They also, that being, that's not all name momentum leader, high performer,
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:38.240]   across the small business, mid-market and enterprise segments.
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:41.440]   They were named good partner and easiest to do business with.
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:43.200]   Yes, I can vouch for that.
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:45.920]   We always love talking to Melissa.
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:50.560]   Easiest setup, highest user adoption, easiest admin.
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:54.320]   But that's a bunch of reasons to check out Melissa.
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:59.120]   Along with leader status, Melissa ranked highly in the price category for clean
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:02.000]   suite and data quality suite across many segments.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.960]   And I think that that's a real testament to Melissa's strong belief that data quality
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:12.560]   should save you more money than it costs you, you know, that you should have a positive ROI.
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:18.320]   And you really do, you know, the average poor data quality costs an average of $15 million
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:20.080]   a year.
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:25.520]   So Melissa's affordable high quality solutions for data quality and address verification
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:31.920]   not only save you money, they say they may save your bacon because bad data gets worse
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:33.600]   the longer it stays in your system.
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:36.400]   And then the more losses you can accumulate.
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:38.880]   And there's all sorts of other associated problems.
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:42.960]   Melissa eliminates waste from incorrect mailings.
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:48.560]   Melissa improves customer satisfaction with seamless real time identity verification
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:49.040]   tools.
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:50.400]   They may help you with compliance.
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:53.840]   There are a lot of businesses where know your customer is a requirement.
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:59.600]   And if you've got duplicates in your database, that's just going to waste so much money.
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:05.360]   Melissa's matching and D-dupe tools help establish a, I wish I could do this on my personal address
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:12.800]   book actually, a single high quality record listing all customer touch points for a customer.
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:16.240]   So you get a complete 360 degree view of each customer.
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:20.160]   It helps you serve them better, market to them better.
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:25.760]   Melissa complies with USPS's move update requirements assures the most current address data
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:30.800]   because they're processing through the USPS's own national change of address database.
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:33.600]   But listen, you know what they've been doing it since 1985.
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:39.200]   No wonder they're experts in global intelligence solutions to help organizations unlock accurate
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:42.080]   data for a more compelling customer view.
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:46.480]   And by the way, you should be reassured your data is absolutely safe on Melissa.
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:52.000]   They undergo continuous independent security audits to reinforce their commitment and to
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:57.680]   reassure their customers that they are committed to data security privacy and compliance requirements.
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:00.560]   And as a result, they're SOC 2 compliant.
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:01.520]   They're HIPAA compliant.
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:03.120]   They're GDPR compliant.
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:05.120]   Your data is absolutely the best answer.
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:07.840]   I'm seeing the website for those of you watching the video.
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:11.040]   There's some great case studies on the Melissa site.
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:13.280]   Go to Melissa.com/twit.
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:16.000]   If you're at all interested in how you might be able to use it,
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.480]   look what some other best practices are.
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:21.040]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.

[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:32.080]   Melissa.com/twit.
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:33.760]   We thank Melissa so much for supporting.
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:37.600]   Mac, break weekly, Melissa.com/twit.
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:40.960]   Okay, Mr. Micah Sergeant.
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:43.200]   Do you have a pick of the week for us?
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:48.480]   I do. And let me get that link popped into the show notes.
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.160]   The app that I want to talk about,
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:55.440]   it's available on the iPad and the iPhone,
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:58.160]   but you can install it on the Mac and I have it on the Mac.
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:00.800]   It's called NOTS 3D.
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:02.400]   NOTS 3D.
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:05.840]   Like KNOTS, like you tie in knots.
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:08.880]   And that's because it is an app.
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:10.240]   Oh, I love this app.
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:11.200]   I love this app.
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:12.800]   Yeah, it teaches you how to tie knots.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:19.360]   So you get to learn in this beautiful animation
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.760]   how to tie all sorts of knots.
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.560]   It's just kind of fun learning about all the knots that are out there.
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:28.000]   They have them categorized quite well.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:29.360]   And you can slow things down.
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:33.360]   They're all 3D, so you can sort of spin them around and look at them.
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:36.160]   And I wanted to mention this one because I can imagine
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:41.200]   in the Vision Pro future where I could take this knot.
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.360]   Oh, now this would be able to look around it.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:44.320]   Now I'm going to buy one.
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:45.280]   Oh, now you're getting one.
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:46.480]   Now I'm going to buy one.
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:48.080]   I never thought of that.
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:49.360]   You got to learn how to tie all the knots.
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:51.600]   Oh my god, you hold the string up in front of you.
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:52.160]   Yes.
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:53.280]   And then you can see and you can...
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:56.560]   Oh, now I'm doing a bump line hitch.
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:49:59.840]   Everybody should know how to do a bump line hitch.
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:01.200]   One of the most important...
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:05.840]   And the only way I can learn is by having a Vision Pro to do it with, obviously.
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:06.960]   Oh, MG.
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:09.760]   Yeah, and then I forgot to mention, they also will link to videos.
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:13.520]   If you want to see sort of hands, do the action first.
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:15.600]   This is the next best thing to having a sailor in your apartment.
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:16.000]   Indeed.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:17.200]   And I don't have one of those.
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:18.000]   Okay.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:19.440]   So I had to do what I had, right?
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:20.000]   Give me a kid.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.240]   Let me show you how to make a clover hitch.
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:23.760]   And then as a secondary little thing,
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:26.480]   I did want to give a super quick shout out.
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:30.160]   There was a nice individual who was golf carting a couple of us.
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:35.120]   And I was talking to Dan Morin, and the person who was driving us said,
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:38.960]   "Do I know your voice from somewhere?"
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:40.160]   And I said, "Me?"
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:40.640]   I said, "Yeah."
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:44.080]   They said, "Mikeus Argent."
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:46.960]   And they are a weekly listener to Mac Break Week.
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:48.400]   You kind of wear a hat or something.
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.560]   Yes, I am, Macus Argent.
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:51.040]   Yeah.
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.560]   And a weekly listener, Mac Break Week,
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.640]   weekly iOS today, several Twitter shows.
[02:50:54.640 --> 02:50:55.360]   Is this different from the other one?
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:55.760]   This is a different term.
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:55.760]   The other one.
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:56.880]   There was two?
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:59.280]   So one recognized me by the look,
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:01.440]   the other person, just my voice, that I thought that was kind of neat.
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:01.440]   Nice.
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:02.720]   So thank you for listening.
[02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:03.200]   Hey.
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:04.720]   Thank you for tuning in every week.
[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:05.680]   Thanks to all our listeners.
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:10.640]   And thank you, Knots 3D, for helping me tie loads of different Knots.
[02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:13.760]   And I apologize to all my friends who work at Apple.
[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:15.840]   I've always been pissed off at me.
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:19.280]   But I, you know, I don't know.
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:24.320]   But I know you guys, you do great work.
[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:25.200]   You work really hard.
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:26.400]   I know, I know.
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.240]   Andy and I go your pick of the week.
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:30.800]   Mine is something that we've talked about before.
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:32.480]   Other people have picked it as the pick of the week.
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:37.520]   However, this time I have now got access to the Arc browser for Mac OS, the new beta.
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:40.720]   And I'm going to add my own testimony to this.
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:42.880]   This is a really, really great browser.
[02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:45.040]   Other people have recommended it.
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:48.720]   What I love about it is that it's the first browser that really tries to
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:54.160]   reconceptualize how a web browser should work in 2023, 2022.
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:57.760]   Instead of having, hey, here is a window with an address bar and some bookmarks.
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:02.000]   The rest of it is up to you to organize it and to figure out how to use this
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:05.600]   and make the best, make the best productivity out of it.
[02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:11.280]   The way that I've got the Arc browser set up for myself is that I basically have decided to
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:13.360]   use it as it's actually dark right now.
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:20.000]   But when I'm using my Mac book or my desktop Mac, my external display here is my iPad Pro.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:23.680]   And I have the Arc browser maximized in this, in this display.
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:27.280]   And I use it basically for everything that I use kind of like as a web app.
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:32.800]   So when I need to get my mail, I've got icons for mail for YouTube for Spotify for Slack,
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:35.920]   all like little icons, a row of icons in the sidebar.
[02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:41.120]   And it also lets you set up like workspaces for when I'm doing all of my research and stuff to
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:47.520]   figure out how to, all the stuff I'm doing for this podcast, all the stuff I'm doing for NPR,
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:51.920]   all the stuff I'm doing for the material podcast, all the stuff I'm doing for one different project.
[02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:57.120]   They're all in like individual like spaces with nicely lined up in the sidebar there.
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:03.520]   The only thing I complain I have about it is simply that I like it too much.
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:06.800]   And I absolutely need my web browser to be cross platform.
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:07.840]   I need it.
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:14.640]   I need to have it on my Mac, on my iPad, on my Android phone, and also my Chromebook.
[02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:18.240]   So if I get too attached to this, if I get too productive with it,
[02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:20.960]   I might be stuck with using this for everything.
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.960]   And I'm not sure if I want that, but it's free.
[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:28.160]   Go to arc.net to sign up for the beta and start using it because, oh my goodness,
[02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:32.480]   it is exactly everything that Safari should steal everything from this, Chrome should steal
[02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:36.560]   everything from this. This is how we have been neglected as web users.
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:43.680]   And finally, Arc is giving us some love from the browser company of New York, arc.net.
[02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:46.640]   I think you still do you still have to get an invite to use it?
[02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:49.440]   Still you still need an invite. It's still it's still in beta, but it's a very,
[02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:50.240]   very stable beta.
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:56.960]   And it's Mac only, although the Windows versions, and I believe an iOS version are
[02:53:56.960 --> 02:53:57.760]   are.
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:59.120]   Oh, yeah, the arc.
[02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:04.560]   Yeah, arc on iOS is a whole, they actually kind of make it as a separate sort of idea
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:08.480]   where it's just almost a list of links as opposed to a full on.
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:09.600]   Yes, really interesting.
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:10.400]   I play with it.
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:12.480]   It does sync between right between.
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:13.040]   Oh, it does.
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:13.520]   Yeah.
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:16.400]   Okay. Yeah. Yeah, very cool.
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:20.080]   It's not based. It's based on Chromium though, isn't it?
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:22.080]   I believe it's a Chromium.
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:27.600]   Yeah. So it's really it's about new thinking about UI in your browser.
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:28.400]   Absolutely.
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:29.200]   Arc.net.
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.360]   Mr. Adex, you'll pick of the week and you can't say Vision Pro.
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:36.480]   Go say the patient brought it yet.
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:36.960]   Oh, okay.
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:43.120]   Yeah. The quick note, this isn't necessarily my pick, but a quick note that
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:47.520]   for us Mac users for a long time and for those of you playing PlayStation,
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:51.920]   there was there was an app that a lot of us played in the 90s called Marathon.
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:53.120]   Oh, God. Yes.
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:53.680]   Yes.
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:54.720]   You see the trailer.
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:55.680]   Did you see the trailer?
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:58.560]   Does the new version of Marathon?
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:00.640]   Bungie is from Bungie version.
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:01.440]   Yeah.
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:02.960]   What?
[02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:03.360]   Yeah.
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:05.280]   There's a new trailer.
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:06.160]   That's why I want to bring it up.
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:09.200]   So it was the trailer was just two weeks ago.
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:11.680]   In my world, like everybody talks about the trailer,
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:15.920]   but I realized I think not everybody has seen that Marathon is coming.
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:17.920]   So Marathon, Bungie went on to do Halo.
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:25.360]   And so Marathon was in effect the granddaddy of Halo, but Marathon was like,
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:29.200]   you had Doom on the, you know, but then you had Marathon and Marathon is what we all played on the
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:29.440]   Mac.
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:33.520]   First person shooter for the Mac, we actually used to play like crazy.
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:34.080]   Like crazy.
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:34.240]   Yeah.
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:35.040]   On the site.
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:36.240]   You had to.
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:36.480]   Wait a minute.
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:37.280]   This is the game.
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:38.080]   The brain caterpillar.
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:39.920]   Boy, this looks a lot better than it used to.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:40.480]   The launch.
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:40.880]   Oh, yeah.
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:41.840]   This is the new one.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:42.640]   It's a brand new one.
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:43.280]   It's a built up.
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:53.280]   But the, we used to have to, to get enough frame rate to play on the 7100, I think it was.
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:55.520]   You had to restart without all the extensions.
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:55.680]   Right.
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:58.400]   So at the end of the day, I worked in a game company.
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:01.440]   And so I was an art director in a game company.
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:05.120]   We were in, we were all in one room, a tiny little game company, five of us or whatever.
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.640]   And you would hear one person about five or six o'clock.
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:10.320]   Some between five and six to hear this.
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:11.200]   Dong.
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.600]   And that means they're restarting with their extensions up.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:17.040]   And then suddenly, and then suddenly, no one said anything.
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:18.320]   No one would say anything.
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:19.440]   It was like, dong.
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:21.040]   And then suddenly, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:22.160]   I'm compiling.
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:22.880]   I'm compiling.
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:25.280]   And then we're like, dong, dong, dong.
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:28.800]   And everyone would, everyone would go in and we'd play.
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:32.720]   And it would always be like, now, if one of your wives called, the key was, is that no one
[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:38.000]   allowed to fire because this, you know, was just broken.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000]   And it would always be someone someone's going, no, no, I'm just finishing up.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:40.800]   I'm just finishing up here.
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:41.840]   And someone would fire their gun.
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:44.800]   And then suddenly, no, no, I'm not playing marathon.
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:47.280]   I'm not, you know, and this is not by the way as I watch it.
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:49.360]   It doesn't look a lot like the old marathon.
[02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:52.800]   No, but it's just, they're going to re-release it though.
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:56.800]   It's going to be, I think they're going to take what they learned on Halo and then apply it.
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:56:59.920]   So marathon, we get marathon back and it's just going to be anyway.
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:02.000]   For some of us, we played it a lot.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.640]   And it's still,
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:11.760]   - Carsten Bondi told me only recently, we all played marathon like crazy on the site
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:14.080]   when we were all doing the MSNBC show.
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:16.320]   This is like you in the mid 90s, 94.
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:19.600]   And we do the same thing would happen.
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:21.040]   They'd all play because it was a network game.
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:22.720]   It was one of the early network games.
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:22.960]   Yeah.
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:27.280]   And Carsten told me that behind the scenes, they were saying, gang up on Leo.
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:33.920]   Yeah. Every time I joined the game, 15 rocket launchers, but all at once would fire up at me.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:37.600]   Oh man. So it turned out that it was the bad guy.
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:40.080]   What do they call it, the Mung Us?
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:41.280]   - The Mung Us? - I was the intruder.
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:44.320]   - Oh yeah. What is that? - I was the imposter.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:46.400]   - And they was a gang. - And it was a sus.
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:49.600]   The difference was they all knew I was the imposter.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:52.480]   But that's not your pick. What's your pick?
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:58.560]   That's not my pick. I think it was released on Friday, but it's called Zoom Cuts.
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:00.080]   And this is new from Lemon Oil.
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:03.440]   This is the company that of course makes Zoom ISO and Zoom OSC.
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:08.720]   And what this is, it is taking a lot, not all, but a lot of what we have in Zoom ISO,
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:10.480]   OSC and Zoom ISO.
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:13.520]   Those are what do you do?
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:20.720]   Wait a minute. So is it? So Andy Carluccio sold liminal or just sold?
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:22.720]   - Sold liminal. - Sold liminal.
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:26.080]   - This is part of Zoom. - It's Zoom extension from Zoom.
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:32.000]   But Zoom is, you know, liminal is keeping its own company, you know, so it's separate from Zoom.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:36.320]   - Oh it is, okay. - So it's like LinkedIn didn't become Microsoft either.
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:38.400]   You know, like so it's, so Zoom.
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:43.520]   So liminal is a subsidiary of Zoom and they keep on, you know, they're developing.
[02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:46.560]   - We love Andy. You introduced him to us. - We think he's so great.
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:48.800]   We use Zoom ISO right now. We're using Zoom ISO.
[02:58:49.440 --> 02:58:52.960]   Yeah. And you're using it now for the, I guess for the, I heard you were using some Zoom stuff
[02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:57.760]   for the calls over the weekend. - Yes, Andy wrote his great script and, oh man,
[02:58:57.760 --> 02:59:01.040]   this is really cool. Yeah. - So it's going forward right now.
[02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:08.160]   - What Zoom cuts does is it allows you to take a lot of the tools that we have in Zoom ISO and
[02:59:08.160 --> 02:59:12.400]   Zoom OSC that are a little geeky. I mean, they tie into a lot of other things and have it just
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:17.440]   with shortcuts. So now you can, you know, there's a lot of like things that you might want to do in
[02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:21.920]   Zoom and that now there's all these short, and it's just a short, you know, these are shortcuts,
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:29.440]   you know, so now you can use them as shortcuts. Adam Tao, who is, who wrote, who also have written
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:38.080]   another program that I talk about, which is, my brain just turned off here, but, but the, but
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:46.000]   Adam is at Zoom as well and it is, and he has written a lot, he's really into shortcuts.
[02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:51.360]   So, so, so, so he, so he built this all out. But what this allows you to do, if you're running Zoom
[02:59:51.360 --> 03:00:01.840]   events, this is, this allows you to go in and, allows you to do a lot of the tools like mute
[03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:07.760]   everybody, unmute everybody, you know, get information, do all these other things. And if you have other
[03:00:07.760 --> 03:00:15.520]   programs that do shortcuts, you are able to integrate those. So you can say, I want you to,
[03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:21.200]   cut to this and play this. So you can talk to another app that is doing shortcuts as well.
[03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:25.200]   You can build very complex shortcuts because of shortcuts can do that on its own. But this,
[03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:30.000]   these give you all the hooks that we had with Zoom, Zoom OSC and Zoom ISO to do those controls.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:36.720]   You have those here and it's, you know, for a lot of people like my wife, friends, I,
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:42.640]   the stuff we do at office hours is pretty complicated. It still needs OSC, but the stuff that my, my
[03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:48.560]   wife does, where she's running Zoom events in the native Zoom environment. This is a really
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:53.520]   powerful set of tools that folks like her are going to use a lot. So Zoom cuts, I would, do you
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:01:00.080]   think that that was, uh, John, a beta of Zoom cuts that Andy was using to automate our workflow
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:06.800]   for the Aztetec guys? No. Ah, okay. Oh, it's a story. Yeah. Yeah. Is it or, yeah. We've talked
[03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:14.320]   about that in the past. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Liminal net liminal@.com.
[03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:22.480]   That's the. So the company's liminal, but the website is liminal plus E T dot com.
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:26.960]   Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And it's the other one that Adam writes is Mix-A-Back Pro, which is something
[03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:31.520]   that you, you, I've already recommended that in the past. And it's the, uh, you can't use an,
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:35.600]   I, in my opinion, don't, you can't use a black magic A10 without Mix-A-Back Pro. So it's,
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:40.960]   oh, so he's, he's really tied. Well, and, and again, because of that, the, the,
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:46.880]   you can tie controls because you have the same person that wrote both of these. You can tie the
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:52.160]   controls from the A10 into the Zoom to tie all those things together as well. So it's a pretty
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:56.080]   nifty setup. And we're going to be talking to both Adam and Andy are going to join office hours
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:02:01.200]   on Thursday to answer people's questions about this and office hours dot global. That's where,
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:07.280]   Mr. Lindsey hangs his hat most of the time. And of course, if you want to hire him 090 dot media,
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:13.840]   I will mention, then I will give you a plug. I will mention though, because Adam sync put this
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:19.920]   in our IRC that you can still play marathon. There's an open source, I know version of marathon,
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:26.640]   the original called Al F one. Uh, it has marathon marathon two and marathon infinity.
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:33.760]   It works on Mac OS 10 windows and Linux and you can play online. So we don't know.
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:38.880]   They don't know. That one big sense of humor though. I did jump on there one time. And I think
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:43.120]   we talked about it on Mac break years and years ago that, Hey, I'm going to go play and you can
[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:47.360]   all go and suddenly like 200 people showed up. And these are folks that have their own little
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:51.120]   like setup that they're doing this with. And suddenly there was, it was mass chaos.
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:55.200]   Interesting. They didn't think we were funny either. They were, they weren't excited that a
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:58.480]   lot of people showed up. They were mostly angry that everyone's messing everything up for them.
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:03.680]   So Google, Al F one and marathon. If you want to try playing it,
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:13.360]   Oh, nine, oh, dot media for his day job office hours. Global for his love, his love job.
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:19.840]   You know, we had a great, we were down at, uh, at Cine gear over the weekend. Cine gear is the
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:25.440]   coolest, like film, like there's an NAB, which is big and IBC is big. But Cine gear is all eye
[03:03:25.440 --> 03:03:29.920]   candy. It's gyms and cameras and lights and everything else. And we were streaming, we stream.
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:36.560]   Look at that. Or four hours live, uh, with a live view and a bunch of, you know, crazy gear from
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:41.280]   electrosonics and, and, uh, caratec and stuff like that. So it was a lot of fun. So anyway,
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.800]   so we did that and we had a, today we had Kelsey Gray on. She's, she writes, she writes this book
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:52.640]   actually, let's make letters and it was all about topography. And so we, we covered a lot of ground
[03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:59.280]   last five days. Always fantastic. And there was a great, uh, uh, coverage of the keynote. You can
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:03.840]   always watch their stream if you don't want to watch ours. Well, it's different. Ours is very,
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:07.440]   yours is much more, uh, you can listen to ours is like, there's a whole bunch of people,
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:11.600]   there's a hundred people in a zoom room all like arguing with each other over whether this
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:16.400]   matters or not. So slightly different. It's a lot more interactive. It's, it's not the typical office
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:18.720]   hours. It's, it's, uh, but the other, there was about a hundred,
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:23.760]   see office free for all. Really. We're all just watching the show and talking about it. It was
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:30.960]   just fun. Andy, when are you going to be on GBH next, uh, this Friday at 1230, I'm actually at the
[03:04:30.960 --> 03:04:35.440]   Boston Public Library studio. So come on down and have a coffee, have a cookie, have a sandwich
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:39.920]   and watch, watch the pictures as I float through the air or if you not don't want to go to the
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:47.920]   Boston Public Library, go to WJBH news.org to stream the audio live or later go to WGBH news on
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:54.720]   YouTube to watch the video. Very nice. Andrew, the, my favorite AI. Thank you very much.
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:59.280]   Mike, a sergeant is a regular on tech news weekly. You'll be back on Thursday to talk about the
[03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:04.080]   week's news with Jason Howell. Of course, every Tuesday morning, right before Mac break weekly,
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:09.520]   you do iOS today with Rosemary Orchard. That's a great show. And then on Sundays, you and I do
[03:05:09.520 --> 03:05:15.120]   ask the tech guys that we do ask the tech guys where we take your questions live on air and
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:20.800]   do our best to answer them unless it's about printers. Uh, no, even then we try. We did a printer
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:25.120]   question. It was the last question of the day and I will never let that happen again. We should also
[03:05:25.120 --> 03:05:33.440]   I was sure we should. Oh, producer, John Ashley says I wouldn't be sure. You also do a podcast,
[03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:38.800]   a wonderful podcast. Really? I got a fem slash clockwise. Only half an hour. Yes, never longer
[03:05:38.800 --> 03:05:44.560]   than 30 minutes is clockwise. The tech podcast where we have two guests on every week. Each
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:49.920]   person brings a topic to the table. We go around the table answering each topic. And you did it
[03:05:49.920 --> 03:05:54.720]   yesterday at the podcast studio. Yes. Dan was able to arrange some time for us to be in the
[03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:59.440]   Apple podcast studio for a brief 30 minutes and then they quite literally
[03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:04.080]   broomed us out the door. But we weren't there long enough to get to do an episode
[03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:10.720]   with Mike Hurley and Jason Snell. Jason Snell is obviously for this. So yeah, that was a good
[03:06:10.720 --> 03:06:16.560]   time to get to chat with the folks. I want to be able to ducking type.
[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:27.120]   Relay.fm slash clockwise. Well, we have approved, I think today, uh, Alex's premise that all
[03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:33.360]   of these should be prerecorded because we have now gone longer by an hour. Oh my gosh,
[03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:37.760]   we've gone longer by an hour than the Apple event. And we didn't even cover all the stuff they
[03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:43.520]   covered. So you're right, Alex. I give you a victory instant victory. Well, three hour later
[03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:49.120]   victory. Uh, we could maybe could have been a little more terse. I am so good. So conversation
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:54.240]   three hours goes by like that. I do can't believe it's been three unless you're listening in which
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:58.880]   case you're going to cuddle puddle of tech love. They're doing like speed. So they're fine. That's
[03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:03.040]   right. It's only an hour and a half for most of them. Uh, thank you all for being here. We do
[03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:09.040]   Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC. The live stream is

[03:07:36.320 --> 03:07:41.760]   really great social network. Uh, plus special shows like Micah's hands on Macintosh that we
[03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:46.720]   don't put out in public. Um, I think it's a good seven bucks a month. That's a well spent seven
[03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:54.160]   bucks a month. Go to Twitch.tv/club. Twitch. If you are not a member, then you can go to the

[03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:12.080]   link at Twitter.tv/mbw or, and I think this is the best thing. Subscribe. Like that really

[03:08:38.400 --> 03:08:46.240]   but now I must say it's his time a to go back to work because break time is over. Hey, I'm Rod

[03:09:00.080 --> 03:09:05.280]   over what's hot and what's not in space books and TV and we do it all for you, our fellow true
