[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.560]   Apple News and man is there Apple News today. Holy cow, that's Andy Inako who fortunately has a
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.960]   thousand-page Google Doc with everything Apple announced yesterday. Hi Andy. Yeah, this is not
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.880]   one of those WWDCs where it's like, oh, I know what they're talking about. Oh, I recognize that
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.960]   acronym. Oh, I know what the ramifications of that are. It's like, as I was watching it, it was like,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.120]   ask Tony about this. Ask Julia about that. See if Bob has an opinion on, yeah, it's...
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   Well, we do have a good expert in studio, or not in studio, but in the Skype with us,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.000]   all the way from Glasgow, Scotland. James Thompson is here. Mr. Puckout.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.680]   Pleasure to be back. I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed. I was up till four in the morning last night
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.200]   getting things going with the new stuff. Wow. So I guess the first thing I should ask you,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.080]   when we talked to you a couple of weeks ago, you were a little concerned, you'd heard the rumor
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.320]   that Apple was going to put a calculator on the Apple Watch. Maybe PukeCalc was Sherlockt? I don't
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.760]   think so. Well, I mean, there was that moment where they showed it and they said, oh, and it's
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.600]   got a tip calculator too, and everybody cheered, and I thought, yeah, I did that years ago.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.120]   Yeah, but can they do it in hex? Well, it's the... I mean, these things happen.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.520]   I don't think Apple particularly went after me, but it was just... It's not always the
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.680]   great to start to a keynote when you get that little dagger in the heart.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.160]   And it is true. This is a Mashable article. Apple fans lose their stuff for an Apple Watch
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   tip calculator. There was a rather loud cheer when it said... Yeah, there was. I was sort of,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.320]   why are you cheering for that? It's the simplest thing ever, but okay.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.640]   And think about how all the other system engineers at Apple who had like, they barely
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.560]   made their deadlines on a project that revolutionizes like, oh my god, a remote monitor that's wireless.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.560]   It took us three years to get this right, and you're applauding for a tip calculator.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.880]   Let alone... There was more time spent on dark mode than the entire Apple TV ecosystem.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.680]   Yeah, if that's probably the only company that really got Sherlock was Duet display,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.840]   because Apple is going to build that into the next version of Mac OS, the ability to use your
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.520]   iPad as a second display. I've used Duet for years. I really liked Duet. They still have a market
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.560]   because it works on Windows as well as on Mac OS. But... Yeah, there was the Luna display people as
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.200]   well who have got the little hardware dongle thing. Yeah, I have a Luna too. Luna's different
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.360]   though because you don't have to be sitting next to the Mac. So it's like almost a remote desktop
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.440]   for a Mac. That's the thing with all these Sherlock's. The stuff that Apple puts in is generally not
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:48.480]   as deep as these products. It does the basics. So there was always a market.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   I've competed with Apple, built in stuff for 20 plus years. So I'm not worried.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   As a developer, let's get your take. I mean, there was a lot in that keynote. It was two hours,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   15 minutes. We covered it. In fact, you can go to twit.tv/specials if you'd like to watch
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.760]   Megan and my commentary over the keynote. But we're not developers. So I'm curious what James
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.800]   Thompson thinks. It was a bit of a roller coaster really. There was so many technologies. The thing
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.920]   that everybody was expecting was Marsapan, which is now Project Catalyst, which sounds like some
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.120]   evil master plan rather than... I don't get why they renamed it because it's not like they're
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.320]   going to show the name Project Catalyst. The catalyst is on Catalina. So maybe that was...
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.480]   Yeah, I figured it was a double cat reference. So everybody was expecting that.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   And the app kit developers were all getting a bit twitchy because they were thinking,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.800]   "Oh, is UI kit going to come along and effectively Sherlock us?" And as it turns out,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.120]   everybody gets Sherlock because there's the SwiftUI framework, which is clearly
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.680]   the future and how far away that future is is a good question.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:15.520]   Yeah, I am not a Swift developer. But when I saw SwiftUI, I thought, "Wow, this is going to be a
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.800]   revolution in software design." Xcode's always had that designer, which allows you to design a UI
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.160]   and then hook up code to go with it. But this has some features that are pretty sweet,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.600]   not unique to Apple. I think React Native does a lot of this. There's the idea that you can have
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.880]   code running and modify it as it's running and see the result in an emulator or even on the phone
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:47.120]   directly. That's pretty cool. Yeah, I mean, it looks powerful. I think there's this little voice in
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.080]   the back of my head that remembers Apple from the 90s who would roll out new things each year.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.640]   How many people jump to support OpenDoc? I'm not comparing this to OpenDoc. But there's just
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:09.600]   that little bit of caution that I have, especially because all my code is 99 or 95% objective
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:18.720]   C UI kit or whatever like that. So this is the future and rightly so I shall fear it.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.080]   As any prudent man would, I have to say, this feels like the death knell for Objective C.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:35.120]   Yeah, I mean, I think things take a long time to die. I mean, carbon is only just about to be
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:43.760]   killed off this year. So carbon, it's had 19 years and then older years before that. I think
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.640]   Apple's APIs tend to hang around for a long time. Most of the system is written in Objective C and
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.280]   things like that. It becomes sort of switch that stuff off. All the APIs still begin with
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:05.440]   NS for next steps. Yeah. Plus, I'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, I was just going to say, so I think
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   this is the future and this is probably something, you know, maybe in the five to 10 year range.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.880]   I mean, I could also see, you know, if they do the AR glasses or something like that, they could
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.520]   say, well, the only interface for this new platform is Swift UI, something along those lines could
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.400]   easily happen. Earlier day, we were talking to Paul Goodman. Of course, he is day one, the journal
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:39.360]   and he is a true cross platform Apple app. They are Macintosh, they are iOS and they even do watch
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.560]   iOS. And I would imagine for somebody who wants to be fully cross platform, the ability to use
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:53.520]   Swift UI and develop for TV, watch, phone, iPad and Mac, all at the same time, it's kind of,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.960]   it's got to be appealing. I mean, you must be looking at that with some interest.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:06.320]   Yeah. I mean, I think in the short term, I can see me doing the project catalyst stuff.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.240]   And then in the longer term, looking at Swift UI, but what I have heard is that you can mix and
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:21.200]   match Swift UI and UI kit and everything. So you can have like a UI kit app that has a
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   Swift UI view in it. And then inside that view, you could have another UI kit thing. So you can kind
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:38.560]   of embed one within the other. So you can start adopting these things slowly. Like if I added a
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.680]   new view, I could just do that in Swift UI. It's not like you have to start the entire app over again
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:53.600]   or something. But we'll see how it goes in the longer term. It looks very interesting.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.520]   I also think for a lot of new developers and maybe even amateur or hobbyist developers,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.080]   this might be really. Yeah, I mean, if you're starting something from scratch, you know,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.280]   it's definitely, I mean, I'd already say, you know, use Swift if you're starting from scratch
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.160]   and learn that. So I'm not sure at what point you'll be able to deploy the Swift UI apps if that's
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:23.440]   coming soon, I expect it is. But with all this stuff, I'm somebody who's sort of,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.400]   I like to leap on old and new stuff, but I also like to have a certain amount of caution about it as
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   well. Yeah, when I talk to developers, it's like if there's one of the main areas of resentment
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.000]   is that oftentimes, like if someone wanted to switch over to this new platform, that's time that
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   they are stealing away from adding new features that they've been having on the back burner for
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.520]   several years. So I know this is optional. I know this is just a really wonderful thing,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.440]   particularly if you're starting fresh, if you're starting something brand new. But there's a
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.520]   reason why carbon lasted for so long. It's because so many developers had so many legacy apps that
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.200]   are really, really important that have a huge, huge customer base. And when it comes to do we
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.000]   support this new feature that all of our customers and all of our users have been clamoring for,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.360]   or do we support, or do we code up this new feature that we've been wanting to do for years,
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.880]   or do we change this sort of back office part of the system that is going to take away a lot of
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.200]   our resources, take a lot of time, and it's not going to be something that's going to be user-facing
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.800]   for several, several years. And they would much rather spend time designing a new icon, for instance,
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.600]   then thinking through the carbon code. This is the story of life, is there's the way Apple
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.400]   pitched so many things yesterday. You can't do it all. You have to pick.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.880]   Yeah. And that's what my job is going to be over the next couple of weeks, is kind of
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.520]   work out what's going to deliver the most value to my customers and me and things like that.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.480]   And I mean, I think even with looking at the Mars-a-pan stuff, I'm going to say Mars-a-pan
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.240]   for the rest of the show. I keep forgetting that they've changed the name. For them, even with
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.960]   the Mars-a-pan stuff, I think I was saying on iOS today, it's like maybe that's something that I
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.800]   don't adopt this year. Maybe that's something that is going to take a longer time to look at,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.760]   until such time as the app would be better than the existing app kit app.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:40.400]   Yeah. Isn't it nice that the integration that they showed off last year, where here are some
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.160]   very, very lame transcriptions of iOS apps we put onto the Mac, and it really didn't fill you
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.960]   with a lot of confidence either on this multi-platform system or on Apple's faith in the Mac's future,
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   but now that they've had the opportunity to show a more fleshed out idea of what we mean by
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.440]   code integration between the two platforms. It's anything that allows developers to have this
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   idea in their head and turn into a useful app faster, that's going to benefit consumers.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.920]   So I'm not as free to that. I used to be last year.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.440]   I mean, the podcast app, it's very hard to tell the difference between that and
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:23.120]   in-coins native app. So, yeah. I think they've done a lot of work in the last year.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.880]   Well, in fact, if there was a tagline for yesterday's keynote, it would be, boy, they've done a lot of
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:39.760]   work. I can't think of another WWDC or any Apple keynote for that matter, where more things were
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.360]   announced, it was just boom, boom, boom, one thing after another. It really felt like Apple has been
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:52.800]   working really hard this year. Not only that, but substantial things.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:59.360]   Like how many times, how many WWDC keynotes to remember where the big, the big hunk on macOS
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.240]   was now let's take a long, let's show you new features in the mail app. Now you can have a
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.480]   different pain. Now you can automatically address things. They were basically very, very low impact.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.720]   What got canceled, what did not get finished in time for the keynote that required Craig to stretch
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.320]   out the macOS version. But like I said, the reason why my own personal briefing talk in
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:31.200]   WWDC is so long, is that almost every section of it has repercussions that seem to get you excited
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.720]   about the next two years of every single hardware platform in the line.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:42.320]   And I am, and I think you guys would agree, I am so absolutely thrilled that they gave such love
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   to the Macintosh. Yeah, I wonder what was project catalyst slash that sweet almond treat.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   And maybe with iPadOS, because they are now breaking out that special version of iOS that's
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:07.520]   for the higher end iPads. If there isn't a move, if I am curious what you think about this,
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.160]   this is kind of a theory, a pet theory of mine. For a long time, I've thought Apple's given up on
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.040]   the Mac, and they're going to release Xcode for iPad, and that'll be it, it'll be all over.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:22.800]   They did not, I might point out. But it does feel like Apple's kind of bifurcating the world.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.960]   There are serious professionals who are going to lay out a serious amount of dough
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.880]   for serious hardware. And then there's the rest of us who aren't going to use a computer at all.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.120]   We're going to use iPads and iPhones. Is there much room left for a MacBook Air, a MacBook,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:46.640]   a MacBook Pro? I think there is. I mean, the amount of work that they did with putting,
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:52.080]   say, the podcast app, as we mentioned, and things like that, it's clear that they are bringing
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:59.680]   more of the consumer-focused stuff from iOS over to the Mac. If they didn't care about the Mac
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.880]   except for people who are running 1000-track logic projects or mainstream.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.480]   That was quite a demo, by the way.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:13.680]   Since we've got 1000 tracks of music, why don't we play four 8K video streams at the same time?
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:22.480]   Holy cow. You've got a lot of singers now who don't have the technical skills of a couple
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.960]   generations ago. It is going to be like record this one note at a time, put every note of a separate
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.760]   track. So, yeah. It's a future music.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:37.760]   But I mean, they seem to be still focusing as much on the consumer side on the Mac.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   I guess you're right. I think that sure, there's an argument that we're the
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.600]   somewhat older guard and we like our laptops and our Mac OS and stuff. But,
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.120]   I mean, let's put it this way. I would say almost none of the developers sitting in the audience
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.280]   for that keynote are going to be able to afford the Mac Pro. So, if we're not the professionals,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.040]   there's still a market for us down at the lower end as well.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:15.760]   James, you're not sinking your massive peak cow earnings into a $6,000 machine plus a $6,000
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   monitor. What's wrong with you? I bought an iMac Pro. I think Apple got their money.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   That's going to do me for a while. And the thing with that Mac Pro that struck me is if we are
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.760]   legitimately like a year away from starting a transition to ARM away from Intel,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.240]   I would like to buy a computer that maybe has got a longer future.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.760]   That's an interesting point.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:46.560]   Although, given how modular this is, it's really just a box with a bus, right?
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.120]   I mean, I don't know how modular the CPU stuff was. I mean,
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.280]   I mean, it's a fabulous machine. I'm never going to own one.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.080]   Yeah, me neither. I would love to.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   And by the way, if they're using this Xeon 28 Core Xeon W processor, that's a $10,000
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.120]   processor for 28 cores alone. The processor alone.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.920]   So, it's talking a 50 grand outlay for a fully specked.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.520]   I mean, it's really, go ahead, Annie.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.360]   It's really clear that this is not a computer for the rest of us.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.680]   This is a computer for a segment of the Mac community, super high-end pro that has never
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.480]   breathed Earth Air or experienced Earth gravity.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.760]   I just want to know who needs one and a half terabytes of RAM.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.720]   I mean, who is it? Well, it's pushing that envelope.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.000]   Well, we're talking about machine learning. What is that?
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.360]   No, well, we're talking about stuff like there was a really great scrolling down,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:58.160]   because again, going through my notes, there is a great thread on Twitter by Michael Pusitari,
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:05.280]   who kind of put it into perspective, saying there are people that are working in pre-visualization
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.600]   where here is your big CGI based motion scene and someone, and that's a walk in through for
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.720]   corporate video or even for a movie. And now someone has said, well, what if they're entering
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   from the left instead of the right? The ability to simply make that change, spit out a quick video
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.240]   and show to them immediately and get that kind of iteration on a project.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.880]   Really, really, really important. The ability to stream multiple to do like host a multiple stream
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:37.120]   at 4K or 8K. That's a really, really big deal. That's rarefied air, and you do need a machine
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.040]   with this kind of performance. The thing is, I don't know that I think that the message that
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.560]   needs to come out is that no matter how intense you think your need for desktop is,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.400]   unless you know every single acronym that's being thrown away, thrown out in the description
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.880]   of this thing, it's statistically unlikely that you need this kind of power. Apple, I think,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.760]   is saying that we created the reason why we updated the Mac mini last year to give it so many
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.120]   top end options if you want to build it out that way is to say that if you're just doing kind of
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.840]   normal video editing, if you're doing normal production, if you're doing normal photo editing,
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.120]   even if you're doing Xcode to a normal level, spend all your money on either an iMac Pro or on a
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:32.160]   top of the line Mac mini. This new Mac Pro is not for you. You're basically throwing money away
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.000]   just to have the prettiest Mac on the desktop. I think a lot of pros actually would be very
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.600]   happy with the Mac mini, but at the same time, you go look at this and you go, God, I'd love to have
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:50.080]   this. One of the things I would say is that this is technology that we can't afford today,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.280]   an Apple can't put into consumer machines today, but maybe in 10 years, we'll have a
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.400]   1000-track logic projects running in our MacBook equivalent. Or our phone, honestly,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.880]   or our phone, or our watch. Who knows? I make a really good point though, James,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.400]   it'd be a foolish thing to spend that much money on a machine that might only have a few years
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.760]   lifetime. Now, if you're a professional, if you're editing 8K movies or making 1000-track
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.400]   logic pros, it's worth it for two years. You can amortize that cost. But for the rest of us,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.520]   maybe it's a good idea. Be prudent to wait and see what happens with all of them.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.640]   None of these machines are going to stop working the day Apple ships and ARM-based machine.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:40.720]   It just means that the transition has started. Well, a couple of things.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:48.160]   One being that it's, again, another thing that I've been reading people who know more than I do
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.880]   about a $10,000 computer and the sort of things they tend to do. One of the things that keeps
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.960]   coming up is that this might be the last time that you can buy something this powerful that sits on
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.000]   one desk. Chiefly because for that super, super high-end stuff, a lot of this work is going towards
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.840]   virtual virtualized machines where you can just bring more cores in as your needs kind of increase.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:17.440]   But that's not going to happen anytime soon. As for Apple going to ARM, I'm not 100% sure that
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.920]   they can build the sort of ARM processors that are going to be able to do that sort of not really
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.800]   consumer, not a Superman Pro user sort of machine. So I think they're still going to need to rely
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.640]   on Intel for that kind of hardware. It'd be interesting if they decided to see, well,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:40.720]   what kind of deal can we come with AMD if Intel is making us upset from time to time about
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:47.280]   its schedule problems? I would bet that there is our people in a secret facility somewhere who
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.640]   are trying to make ARM chips go very fast when they are cooled and being fed with mains power
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:01.280]   and don't have to throttle and all this sort of stuff. So I mean, if anyone could do it, I think
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.160]   Apple can. They've got the people and we've seen some amazing silicon that's come out of them.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:14.560]   I had a running bet that the Mac Pro was going to be some 64 core ARM thing just because if I was
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:22.240]   right, I would have looked like an absolute genius. You'll get the sign and it's just like 128
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.920]   Raspberry Pi's all network together. Yeah. And when you make a good point that with things like
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:35.840]   Google's TPUs in the cloud, that's going to be in the long run perhaps for a lot of solutions,
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.920]   a better solution. But there are still people who need a lot of silicon on their desktop.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.480]   I am for one. I'm just very, I'm actually very grateful. We've been saying,
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.040]   and I didn't think there was a chance in hell for months on Mac break weekly,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.640]   bring back the cheese grater. That was the perfect Mac Pro. It was a foolish thing Apple
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   finally admitted, I think, to go to the trash can Mac. This was a great design. And when they
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.240]   brought back the cheese grater in spades, I mean, it literally looks like a cheese grater.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.880]   There were a lot of people who don't remember that that was the nickname for the old Mac Pro's who
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.200]   were saying, you know, posting on Twitter posting pictures, go ahead, put the cheese grater on the
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.720]   desk posting pictures of actual literal cheese graters saying it looks like a cheese grater.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.960]   Well, that's what we called this. And it's very in many ways, it's very similar to the tower
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.160]   Mac Pro. Yeah, I mean, I get a great, go ahead James. I was just going to say,
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   except I could afford one of those. Yeah. Well, no, I was looking at Twitter. Somebody just posted
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:43.040]   on Twitter, Jimmy Greewell, the first professional Mac prices. I remember the two FX, which we colloquially
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:50.080]   called the two effing expensive. Yeah, started at $10,000. A Mac 2 was $5500, but
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.520]   dollars 2x 7769. And that was, by the way, this is in 9, this is in 2000, whatever is it,
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.720]   1996 dollars. This is like to see that it's adjusted. Yeah, this is not modern dollars. A
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:11.040]   two CX was $5,369. Quadra was 900 was $7,200. So this isn't, I think you made a excellent point,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.280]   James, which is, that's what this cost today. And 10 years from now, it might be in a phone.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:24.400]   So but it is a beautiful work of art, stainless steel, which is really interesting.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.680]   Does the Apple logo on that look unusually large?
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.640]   But the same, it reminds me of what it would have been on the old machines.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.920]   Yeah, it looks like the old machines. It is. It's just, in fact, you're right.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.160]   Well, you guys have good eyes. It's exactly the same. I got one under my desk.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.360]   I forgot how big that was on the old machine. I kind of like the fact that they're taking a
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.520]   design cue for one of the prettiest Macs I've ever made. This is like the G4 cube where
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   twist out this nice handle and the entire thing comes out. Isn't that sweet?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   It is cute. You're right. It opened it. You take it out and it opens it up.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.520]   They also, they also make the point that not only, I do think that the new double cheese
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.080]   grater is really, really cool looking. They did make the point that it's also functional because
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:15.440]   it's really all about airflow. A couple of people I know who were, had access to them at WWDC were
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:21.360]   saying that it actually sounds a lot quieter than their, their iMac pros in terms of when the fans
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.920]   have to kick in and how the cooling goes. It's really interesting. It's a unique look. And of course,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:31.760]   it's repeated on the back of the new monitor as well. I just think this is, watch this. This is so
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.160]   beautiful. Oh my God. And one of the things we liked about the old tower Mac was the wiring was
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:46.800]   hidden away. These modules popped in and out. No one in the world needs four Radeon Pro Vega 2s,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.640]   or maybe they do if you have 8K. Yeah, they do. Yeah. But just just just gorgeous. So,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:59.280]   you make an interesting point. This CPU may not be that modular. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.960]   it might be that that's a logic for it. Although, but there's, there's still a lot. Who knows? Yeah,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.400]   there's still a lot you can add that the relying on MPX modules. Now that they've got so many
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.200]   PCIe slots, if you want to keep adding hard work, accelerators, you can do so without having to go
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:23.280]   outside through some Thunderbolt. But wait a minute. How is he doing that? It looks like we've
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:30.000]   actually got one delivered. We've got some sort of weird augmented reality Mac Pro on the table
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.800]   here replacing the old cheese grater. That looks pretty sweet. I think we maybe have to buy one.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.440]   Just, you know, that's actually that's actually a great product. And someone may
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.600]   manufacture just something that looks like that shell that's just a little bit darker than the
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.880]   old Mac cheese grater. That's just a little lower around it. Is this an Apple AR? So, it's
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.800]   something from ARKit that Apple's distributing. So, you can see what it would look like. That's
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.480]   actually doing a really good job of augmented reality. It's sitting on the table very nicely.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.720]   Well, I want to put wheels on the bottom of that and have it motorized so it just follows your
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.880]   round. I just think that that's going to be. You got really excited to put that kind of stuff in there.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.400]   How much do those wheels cost, do you think? What's your bet? I bet 500 bucks for the set of four.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:22.160]   You think less? I hope less. If the stand for the monitor is a thousand dollars.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:29.920]   Yeah. I mean, I don't know why they broke the price out. For that, if they just said the
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.640]   monitor costs six thousand dollars, nobody would be poking fun at a thousand dollars.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:40.960]   That's a good point. I understand, for instance, in fact, I've texted Alex Lindsey,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.400]   say you're going to buy one. He's not responding, which means he probably already did. But
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.240]   I think what they're saying is, and remember, they brought in after the failure of the trash
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   can. Remember, a couple of years ago, they made the apology. They said, "We're working on the next
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.680]   generation Mac Pro won't be this year. Won't be next year." They were right. It'll be fall of
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:06.240]   this year. But one of the things they said about it is we've actually hired professionals, video
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:13.760]   editors, music creators, developers. We've hired people to be in our design lab to give us input on
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:20.560]   what this Mac Pro should be. Alex Lindsey, for instance, throws away the stands. Even when he
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.920]   buys an iMac, he puts a visa mount on everything in an arm. I think for some professionals,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.040]   the idea that I didn't want to stand. I want the visa mount, or I have my own thing that I'm going to
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:38.880]   do. It actually makes sense. But you're right. It became a laugh line. I'm surprised Jimmy Fallon
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:45.360]   didn't mention it on late night, last night, to have a thousand-dollar monitor stand. But it does
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:51.760]   some really cool things, right? I think for the people who are buying these whatever $30,000
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:59.920]   reference monitors who look at those this and go, it's only $60. That's who this is for. It's not for
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:07.440]   me. I've got a really nice screen on this iMac Pro that I'm looking at now. It's only $5K,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:13.200]   not $6K. It's not the full HDR, whatever. It's still a really nice screen.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.320]   I don't think it's an issue or anything. But I wouldn't say that this would have been a great
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.880]   opportunity for Apple to impress us with, "Hey, we can actually design something that's functional
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:29.680]   and cool that does not cost $1,000. We can actually make something that costs only as much as a mid-range
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.000]   notebook, as opposed to a release. That's not Apple's way. Come on.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.040]   When you find out that someone you really, really like is, "Oh, well, I like that he's so
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:47.200]   simply. You only wear these black t-shirts." Instead of thinking, "Oh, he buys the Haynes BFTs
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.680]   that are $20 for a 4-pack." No, he buys these $380 T's that look exactly like everyone else.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.520]   Again, you don't think less of them, but it's like, "Oh, that's a little bit disappointing."
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.560]   Look who has joined us. The beard has appeared. Jim Dowry, from the Loop, loopedinsight.com.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.040]   Hi, Jim. How you doing, Leo?
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:11.840]   Have you been enjoying a WWDC so far? I have. I apologize for being late.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.360]   You had other things going on. I'm sure you were watching streams.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.520]   In fact, I'm surprised you're not down at the McHenry.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.280]   No, I told you I'd be here waiting for you.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.240]   Nice. Thank you.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:30.960]   So joining us, James Thompson, the creator of Pete Kalk, he's in Glasgow, Ireland. Andy Naco,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.760]   you know?
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.720]   Cheers, Scotland.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.160]   Does that say Ireland?
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.280]   I am so sorry.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.520]   You can hit me if you want. That's terrible.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.720]   How close are you to the castle where the Game of Thrones episode three was filmed?
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.760]   I don't know. A lot of the castles are in Northern Ireland, but I think Winterfell is in Scotland.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.720]   I have not visited.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:59.440]   Looked cold. That's all I can say. It looked really, really cold.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.560]   Jim, we've been talking about the Mac Pro. And again, I just want to say thank you,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.960]   Apple, for listening. Because this is, I think, what I wanted. I think what most pros want it.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.560]   I'm not going to buy one, but I think it is exactly what a Mac Pro should be.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.680]   Look at the cooling in this thing. Let me, I love the animations on these websites.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   I guess I can't get it to do it again.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:28.000]   But the cooling on this thing, it has a 1.4 kilowatt power supply.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:36.240]   I mean, this thing is amazing. 1.5 terabytes of memory, 12 dim slots.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   256 gigabytes SSD stock. That was the weirdest thing. But I guess with all those thunderbolt
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.240]   ports, you're probably going to use an faster external drive anyway.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.320]   You have to get that entry level price down.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.200]   Geez, Louise. Come on, guys. It's not that expensive for a terabyte SSD anymore.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.560]   There was some people were saying that these SSD speeds they're quoting are not particularly
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:06.480]   good. I think 2,400 megabits per second, or is it gigabits per second reading right?
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.080]   I think it was megabits per second reading right. Not super fast, but maybe you can speed that up.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.840]   Thunderbolts certainly could do better than that.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.880]   I had a chance to see one yesterday.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.600]   Oh, tell us.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   And the experience.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.480]   It was beautiful.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:31.120]   It was beautiful. But from a pro perspective, I went into, they had a different session set up,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.880]   where we could go take a look at the Mac Pro in action.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.520]   And of course, I won't rate to the music one.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:45.920]   So they had a Pro Tools project that was recorded in Abbey Road Studio.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:53.040]   It had hundreds of tracks on this project. And
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:02.640]   the big difference was that when it was first recorded, they recorded a full orchestra.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.880]   That needed its own machine.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.240]   And its own giant room.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:13.280]   So they recorded the orchestra on a separate machine.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.000]   I believe they had something else that they had to record on a separate machine.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.400]   Maybe it was a second piece of the orchestra.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:28.080]   And then they had a third machine that was dedicated to all the other instruments that
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.800]   they were recording. And then they had video that was embedded in there.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:39.440]   So all of this took three machines to do in Abbey Road when they recorded it.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.400]   It was all running on one Mac Pro.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:50.480]   And it was incredible. And being an audio guy, I know what plugins
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:57.520]   will affect the power and CPU of an audio project.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.800]   So I had the guy scroll over. I said, no, no, no. I want to see what you're running here.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.240]   So he scrolled over and all the tracks. Plugins were running live.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.360]   They had some outboard gear from Universal Audio there.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   And Universal Audio will take up a lot of power, even though they offloaded to its own cards.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:26.800]   The DSP, it takes up some processing from the computer.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.880]   And they had a lot of other plugins installed too.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.480]   So this is all going live while they're playing it.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.680]   And they brought three computers into one. And it was seamless.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.080]   And there were still lots of power left on this machine.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.880]   So was it a fully equipped machine? Do they say how it was equipped?
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   Ah, they didn't. They didn't. But I just assumed that it was fully equipped.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:59.360]   But when you're talking pros, that's what you're talking.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:07.600]   You're looking at situations where music studios, they also had a logic set up
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:15.200]   the same way. So when you're looking at that and you're a music studio,
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.680]   you say, OK, one machine, three machines. I mean, it was powerful.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:27.520]   It was doing amazingly well. And both of them were playing video at the same time.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.120]   Is it as beautiful in person as it looks? Yes.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.160]   It really looks. I mean, it's obviously very familiar.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.480]   You know, we've seen that, that type of design.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:45.520]   And so you look at it and say, OK, now it's like a hyper cheese grater instead of just the
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.760]   cheese grater that we were used to. But it looked really, really nice.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   And when I had my studio before, I mean, I would record the entire band. I was, you know, I had
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.720]   Mackie boards set up so that I could control everything. And it was all going into one of the
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:13.120]   cheese grater Mac pros. But you know, with that many mics and that much processing,
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.360]   sometimes it would hiccup a bit, not much. But this just wouldn't. I mean, there's no way that I
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:27.840]   could have enough power or enough inputs going into that to even make it hiccup.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:34.080]   It was incredible. And that is a pro machine right there.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   Yeah. When you can take three and bring it down to one, I mean, I know that people are talking
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.680]   about the cost, but the cost for somebody like Abbey Road. Nothing.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:53.360]   Is time and processing and extra computers. And you put all those together to make this project.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.640]   And, you know, if they can do it in one, well, that's cost well spent.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.080]   How about the pro display XTR? Did you get to see that?
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:10.240]   I did. And unfortunately, because I was so enamored with what was going on.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.920]   You're looking at the music.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:17.840]   The music stuff. Yeah. Because I kept trying to trick them. I'll tell you, I kept, you know,
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.360]   scroll over. Let me see the plug.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.240]   I love that. One of those. That's great. They all active.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.200]   I'm glad you were there.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.040]   You were there. And do something here. Yeah.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:31.920]   So the pro display was there. I didn't get a chance to see it a lot, but it looked amazing.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.960]   I didn't talk about it a lot. I realized that after I left,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:43.200]   damn, I should look at the pro display. Yeah. How quiet was that machine running all of those tracks?
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:52.560]   You couldn't hear it at all. You couldn't hear it at all. And this was this was a closed off type of
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:59.920]   what would be a studio setting. Obviously, it wasn't, you know, complete, but it was a closed
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   off area in a room. So if there was any massive amount of noise, you would have heard it.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:15.040]   And at times, he quieted the music, pulled down the the switches and, you know, muted the music
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.320]   just so that I could talk to him. Yeah. And so we were standing there talking right beside the
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:28.560]   machine. And there was, there was nothing. And it, it had to be even according to the, to the CPU
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:36.240]   lever, meters, it, it was working hard. So, you know, wasn't at a time when he can,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.880]   he didn't stop playing the music. He just muted it. So there was no noise, you know, no discernible
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:53.840]   noise anyway. Pretty sweet. Yeah. Yeah. So as a president, my birthday is coming in September.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Now let's see the XDR display 6000, the base model, but it's only 256 k storage. I think you kind of
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.240]   have to maybe and really is eight cores enough after all. I think we're going to need more than
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:15.760]   that. I think we're talking 10 grand 12 grand 15 grand. I think we're talking about $20,000
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:21.680]   for even a moderately equipped system if you want to use play. Yeah. So you're welcome. Thank you.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.560]   That's the great thing about all those open drive base. If you, if need be, you can actually live
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.800]   inside it. Like if it's going to be in that housing. Oh, it's my new house. And you can put
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.640]   wheels on it to drive our wheels. I think that's a great thing. It's also, there's a rack
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.880]   mountable version of it. And ever since Apple killed the X serve, I thought, gee, Apple doesn't
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.400]   want to be in the data center. How do you rack about a trash can? People did it, but not,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.440]   not well. The fact that there's a rack mount version again tells me Apple's just really been
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.240]   listening. And yeah, I think we give them a hard time. I give them a hard time for not listening.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.520]   I want to give them a lot of praise for really listening to what serious pros wanted and stepping
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:15.600]   up. They, this is, this is a situation where I think Apple was given a hard time and rightfully
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:23.040]   so. They, they deserve that hard time for, for the Mac Pro. But they answered in spades. I mean,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:30.640]   I was, I was expecting a powerful machine. I was, but I wasn't expecting what they gave us.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.720]   Yeah. I was really surprised.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.920]   One suspect that they said to the designers, do not consider cost.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.560]   Well, I mean, if you're looking at pros again, I don't think that the,
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.280]   there's nothing wrong with that. That's right. Pros aren't looking at the cost.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:55.440]   But I'm just saying normally, I mean, even with the original Mac and with the iMac jobs,
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.280]   would sometimes, you know, I remember the story, Johnny, I'm saying you want to handle on that.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.680]   That's going to cost you. And jobs said, no, we're going to do it. But most of the time,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.480]   you have to consider the cost of manufacture, the difficulty of manufacture, the final cost of the
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.680]   product. Will anybody buy it? But every once in a while, you get a chance to say,
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.760]   look, we're not going to worry about how much it costs to make. What would be the best thing
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   you could do? I have a feeling even those holes are not expensive. Right?
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:30.560]   But I think isn't that what they, they kind of did with the trash cam Mac Pro. They wanted
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:38.000]   something that would appeal to everybody to have a Mac Pro on their, their desk. And, you know,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.320]   they made this beautiful looking design or the overall engineers. That was the, I think the problem.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   Right. So now they went the opposite way. Exactly. And what worked? Well, the, the
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:56.160]   cheese Gator Mac Pro worked great. I had a G5 of that. I have an Intel version. I mean,
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.160]   that thing just worked amazingly well. We still have half a dozen here. I mean,
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:07.920]   yeah, they, they went back to that design, but they powered it like crazy. And that's what people
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.120]   want. That's what they wanted. They had a 3D studio set up in there. They had a photography
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:20.480]   studio set up in there. It was just the things that they were doing on, they had green screens.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:27.120]   They had everything set up in there. Every type of major pro workflow from video 3D,
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.280]   music, everything was there. Not just to call back to the cheese Gator Mac though,
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.880]   call back to the iMac, the Luxo lamp iMac with that stand in the arm. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:46.320]   I remember jobs agonized over that arm and getting it right and making it so it wouldn't wear out.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.960]   And it looks like that engineering has lived on with this new stand.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:59.680]   That iMac that was peak out got bundled on that iMac. No kidding. Yeah. So we made a decent chunk
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:05.600]   of change. That's nice. That was a beautiful Mac that Luxo lamp Mac. Yeah. Now on that,
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.080]   let's not forget that it was not just really cool looking, but it was absolutely functional. It
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:15.280]   echoed the original Mac having a handle in the back of it. You could actually carry that iMac
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.800]   from one place to another just by holding on to the neck of that lamp without risking breaking it.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:28.000]   And the ability to have one computer that will adjust to parents height all the way down to like
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.840]   a little kid being able to adjust to that. That's apple design at its best. Really, really cool.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:40.400]   And yes, it costs a bit, but it really opens up the potential of how you can use a piece of hardware.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.280]   And if you want to play with that augmented reality we're playing with, it's actually on the
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.120]   Apple webpage. You have to use Safari and then surf to that page. And I've done that. And one of
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.560]   the beautiful things you can do, I don't know, do you have a shot of over my shoulder? You don't
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.040]   have that shot at all. Oh, too bad. One of the things you can do is you can make it bigger or smaller.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:07.440]   Now I have a little mini version of it. Let's take a little break. We'll talk more about WWDC.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.480]   James Thompson, the creator of peak calc is with us from Glasgow, which is now in Scotland, I understand.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.680]   Thanks for joining us. Another another tax dodger.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:24.560]   They moved it to Scotland. Also, Jim Dowerimble, thank you so much for being here, Jim.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.120]   I imagine you're going back to the convention center right after the show.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.240]   As soon as we're done here, I'm heading back to WDC.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.920]   In that case, I'm very grateful that you took time for us. I really appreciate it.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.440]   And Andy and I, co, has got nothing better to do. So back in the library.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.560]   I see. Now I'm just teasing you. You're in the library. I love it.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.680]   It hurts. It went true.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:57.920]   Andy, of course, is heard regularly on Boston Public Radio, WGBH. Yes, it's great to have all three of
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.720]   you here. I showed today brought to you by the best little Wi-Fi device you ever saw. In a way,
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:10.480]   you know, this is, to me, reminds me a little bit of Apple design. This is an Eero Beacon E-R-O.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.080]   The speaking I have actually quite a few in the house. I think I have four or five
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:22.880]   beacons, an Eero base station. This is the best Wi-Fi I've ever had. It solves all our Wi-Fi woes.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.760]   What happened when Wi-Fi first started, right? You had a couple of computers.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.000]   You didn't have Amazon Echoes. You didn't have Netflix. You didn't have a whole bunch
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.200]   of other stuff. But as we've laden all this stuff on top of our Wi-Fi signal, it's just stopped
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.080]   working. And then there's the neighbor who's blasting her Wi-Fi out over the airwaves.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.520]   It's physics. The Wi-Fi is kind of basically, it's like light waves.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:55.360]   Wi-Fi doesn't go through walls well either. And so you wouldn't set up a table lamp in your
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.400]   living room and expect to read a book in your bedroom when you got to do the same thing with
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.680]   Wi-Fi. You need a distributed system. In fact, even enterprise has been using it for years. We've
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.400]   had distributed Wi-Fi for years in our studios. Now you can have it in your home. But the great
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.920]   thing about this is it's easy to set up with the Eero app on your phone. It'll walk you through
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:22.960]   every step of the process, where to put your beacons for maximum performance. You can manage
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.920]   that network too, right from your phone. You'll know how many devices are connected at any given
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:32.720]   time. You'll have the internet speed you're getting from your service provider. It does a bandwidth
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:39.200]   test every night. I love that. Let me just open up the Eero app on my phone. I actually monitor my
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:47.440]   mom's Eero network as well because when I got the new Eero beacons, I replaced her bad Wi-Fi
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:54.080]   with Eero. And since she's in Rhode Island, I can easily check how she's doing. Let's just see here.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:01.280]   Oh, look, her Eero is just updated to Eero OS 3.130. That's another great thing I love about the Eero.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.600]   And actually, this is a rule of thumb, Stacey Higginbotham. Stacey on IoT and this we can Google
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.640]   said, "Every IoT device in your house from now on must have automatic over-the-air updates for
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.080]   security." Eero does. And it's updated regularly. Let's see how my mom, her bandwidth isn't great,
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.000]   but she doesn't need a whole lot of bandwidth. Six megabits down, three megabits up. What's nice
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.720]   though is I could see that all the Eero's in her house are playing nicely, getting good throughput.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.200]   I could see all the devices connected. I could see she just got the update. Let me switch over
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:40.560]   to my network here. I'm going to switch networks to... That's her network to my network. And I can
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.800]   see how many devices. I'm just curious how many devices are on my network right now. 32 connected
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:53.440]   devices. And that's only because I'm not home. It would go up by about five or six if I were home.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.200]   But we're getting 94 down, 12 megabits up. I could see... And... Oh, let me show you Eero plus. This is
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:05.440]   fantastic. We have a teenager in the house. I use Eero plus. This is well worth it for its advanced
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.480]   security. It prevents access to sites that host malicious content, viruses, botnets,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:17.920]   phishing sites automatically. It has ad blocking if you want to use that. And for Michael, our
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:25.840]   teenager, I use the safe filters. So I apply it just to Michael's devices. All of his devices are
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:32.800]   named. And in his personal Eero portfolio, which is nice because come around 10 p.m. I also turn
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   off the internet. Bedtime, Michael. I love that feature. In fact, it's his new favorite thing.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.840]   Can I have 10 minutes more of Wi-Fi, please? Please? Just five minutes more. I love to see
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:53.520]   teenagers beg. Eero keeps us safe at home with reliable security. And it doesn't just defend
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:50:00.960]   our Eros. It defends every device in our house. So Eero plus is well worth it. It tags sites that
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.600]   contain violent illegal or adult content. We can choose what Michael can see and not see. And what
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:11.440]   I can see and not see, it is just great. And I control it from the app. He can't turn the Wi-Fi
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:20.720]   on. But I can actually tell my Amazon Echo, Eero. Pause Michael's Wi-Fi. It's a great punishment.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:26.880]   Very satisfying. Never think about Wi-Fi again. $100 off the Eero base unit with two beacons and
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.800]   a year of Eero plus. That's nice. Just go to Eero.com/Macbreak. If you use the code Macbreak,
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:41.760]   you'll save $100. Eero.com/Macbreak. Life's too short for bad Wi-Fi. You owe it to yourself.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:48.640]   Eero.com/Macbreak. If you use the code Macbreak, you'll save $100. We thank Eero for their support
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:53.520]   for making a great Wi-Fi system. We thank you for using that Eero special Eero address, letting
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:51:05.200]   them know. You heard about it on Macbreak Weekly. Okay. Let's see. Oh, there's cheese grater wallpaper.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:15.920]   Okay, I'm putting this on my Windows machine right now. That's going to make people crazy. Look
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:22.240]   at that cheese grater wife. Oh, it's getting bigger. Wow. That is really sweet. Thank you, Apple.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:28.160]   They're so good engineers with kids. They're going to be so many crayons shoved through that.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.480]   Well, it's nice as they melt as you push them through. So it's perfect.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.280]   There you go. It's like a little crayon melting device. It is Pride Month.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:46.720]   I'm a rainbow Mac pro. I guess we could talk about the specs on the display. They showed,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.680]   and they were probably right to do so. A $50,000 professional display. They said,
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.400]   these are things are expensive, but now you can get all of that in a mere $6,000
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:03.520]   display if you get them on understand. That's a nice device. Let's talk about what's happening
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.360]   to the iPad. I thought that was very interesting. They're literally calling it iPad OS now.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:15.280]   Yeah. I think that that is a more marketing thing than an actual engineer.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:22.400]   Still iOS, right, James? Yeah. I mean, most everything by the Mac is iOS under the somewhere.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   Yeah, they call it watch OS TV, OS, iOS, iPad, OS. It's all iOS.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:34.480]   But I think this is basically exactly iOS. It's the same code that's running on the phone.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.640]   It's just does it say, oh, you're on an iPad. I'm going to do something different.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.440]   Oh, yeah. I mean, it's like apps. You can't do those things on a phone though.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:54.320]   No, no, no. But it's, I don't think that somebody has taken the source for iOS and moved it into a
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:05.200]   separate room. Well, Apple is clear that it is iOS. They're just creating not even a fork of it,
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.000]   but basically a super set of it. Kind of like the way they used to talk about OS 10,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.200]   being at the core of everything that they're doing that Mac OS 10 is different from iOS,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.000]   even though they have essentially the same stuff with the core, they just added stuff to the to
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.280]   iOS that a Mac doesn't need. And they've added stuff to Mac's Mac OS that iOS doesn't need.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.840]   I thought I even if it is a change in name only, I don't think that's necessarily true.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:37.680]   That is a powerful statement, though, that you're targeting instead of conceptually writing an app
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:42.800]   that could be I'm generating code that could be for an iPad. It could be for iOS. Ideally,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.680]   I'm creating one app that could transmogrify itself, depending on what device it's on.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:53.520]   The mindset of saying, no, I'm creating a IFS design to exclusively take advantage of things
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:54:00.240]   that are special to the iPad, the larger size screen, the fact that the fact that split view works
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:04.560]   in pretty much everything, any other features they choose to come up with. The idea that in the
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.560]   future, there might be special APIs or special app permissions that you can only get on an iPad
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:17.840]   OS app that you can't get on an iOS app. More than anything else, though, I think it really is
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:25.680]   a nod to how serious Apple is about promoting the iPad, the iPad Pro as a real computer.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.560]   That this is a statement that they can definitely defend that anytime over the past two or three
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:36.480]   years that someone has complained that yeah, but geez, Apple computers are only for people who can
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:43.760]   afford to buy luxury Mac books and luxury desktops. They can very credibly say that while we do make
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.200]   really good $329 computers and really good $700 computers, they're just called iPads.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:54.560]   So if all this is is the ability to really get the entire community of users and developers to
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.600]   take this seriously, not as this is not just a movie, this is not just something for watching
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.240]   movies on, this is not just something for Instagramming or Facebooking. This really is
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.880]   something that you can take on a three or four day business trip and not just again, entertain
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:15.440]   yourself on the flight, but actually get real work done. It doesn't look like much right now,
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:22.320]   but two years from now, if they decide to finally just admit it and add a pointing device,
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:27.680]   add a trackpad or add an optional mouse to it, it will be absolutely more natural to make that an
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:33.520]   iPad OS exclusive than ask something that could conceivably be misinterpreted as a feature that
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:40.400]   could work with an iPhone as well. Really interesting move. Yeah, I mean, I think it really frees
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:48.160]   Apple. Go ahead, Jim and then James. Yeah. You know, this with it felt before like Apple wanted to do
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:54.320]   something different with the iPad, but couldn't because they were kind of constrained with what
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:01.520]   people expected in iOS. But now now that it's separate, they have the ability to go in and do
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:09.040]   some really great things with iPad OS for what that crowd wants and make it different from
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:15.760]   iOS on the phone. And I think that's great. It's going to be a good thing because you'll have
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:21.680]   features in Mac OS, you'll have features in iPad OS and that features for truly mobile in
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:28.480]   iOS. Apple did confirm after the event that it will support all iPads. It's not just for the iPad
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:34.240]   yeah, which is interesting. James, go ahead. I was going to say like the stuff that they have
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:41.200]   introduced the multiple Windows support and the sort of spaces and expose concepts coming over
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:46.880]   from the Mac, that's the, you know, the interesting thing to me. And it makes a big difference.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:54.320]   I felt like a lot of this stuff came from an Andy, you probably using Android P or Q.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:02.880]   Q. Yeah. So a lot of this came over from Android Q, dark mode. Google's been doing that
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.560]   gradually over time. The widgets, swipe keyboards.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:14.160]   But just the idea of having a new home screen just for the iPad, so long and
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:20.080]   oh my God, such a big deal. This was ridiculous. The amount of wasted territory on an iPad with
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:26.160]   that home, same home screen grid you'd see on an iPhone was insane. Now, do we know it says pin
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.440]   your favorite to debut widget on the home screen? Do we know if this is they can only live on the
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.640]   left? Can they live on multiple screens? Can you do we know anything about that? Jim, were you
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:42.320]   able to play with the iPad OS at all? I was not. No, you're too busy stirring at that.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:47.600]   That happy road demo. I have a feeling you were mesmerized for hours.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:54.480]   I look at it and ask questions. James, have you seen anything in the kids?
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.920]   No, I mean, I've like run virtual iPads, but I didn't even think to check about the
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.080]   the widget stuff. I was just trying to get all my code working again.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.120]   So you have downloaded iOS 13 developer preview?
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:15.040]   Yeah, I've got that and I've got Catalina installed and UX code and things like that.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:20.800]   Are you allowed in days gone by? You couldn't talk about it if you had it, but I think now they've
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   removed that, right? I don't think if I say anything that's covered by the keynote and the
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:34.160]   European state of the union, that's usually fine. But to be honest, Apple, I think has not
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.600]   really cared for many years. Especially since there's a public beta coming in a couple of months,
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.640]   right? I mean, any. But you never know when they will start caring again.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:52.000]   Well, that is true. Like in Russia, they don't care that you've been bribing public officials,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.840]   they're counting on it. But if they decide you need to be put in jail, your money taken away,
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.800]   suddenly they charge you with bribing a public official. Yes.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:04.640]   I'm glad we have a better screen layout. Looks like you can really get a lot of icons into this grid
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:11.680]   now, which is great making room for widgets from the today view, which is really nice as well.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:17.040]   I've I use that on Android all the time. But there aren't really no good Android tablets. So
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:24.080]   this will be this will be a different experience. Pencil has a lot of very nice new features,
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.000]   which is good because that's one of the thing that's unique. They didn't mention
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.600]   mousing, but Renee Richie did go backstage and was able to confirm that, yes, as we had thought,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:40.640]   the mouse support in the iPad is inaccessibility. So you now he didn't mention trackpad. So we
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:46.000]   know at least mouse support. He also said full keyboard control for the entire UI,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.280]   which I really liked. So you have three different ways now that you control the UI with mouse.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.720]   Full keyboard control, which for me is very important. I actually work in command line a lot.
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.440]   I don't want to put my hand even on a mouse level on touch the screen. So keyboard control is
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.880]   really important to me. And they showed off the voice control. And that was very impressive as well.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.240]   But we should we should point out that I think it's really significant that they put all that
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.360]   stuff that is could be transformative for the iPad. And they put it in access accessibility,
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:20.160]   which is places where it's not just a convenience for someone like me. It is some it is a feature
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.280]   for people who could not make full use of the thing. But but but the thing that gave a spotlight
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:31.920]   on was the one part of their iPad section that kind of got me confused and that yes, we're all sort of
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.800]   really, really hungry for give us some mouse give us mouse support, give us give us some sort of
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:43.120]   trackpad support and say good news. We listened to you and hear a new triple finger taps to get to
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.280]   move and pay text. It's like, okay, I absolutely don't care if I'm going to be. It's so hard to
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.120]   remember all of these new like multiple finger taps when if I'm going to be doing text manipulation
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.360]   of that kind, I'm probably going to have a keyboard in front of me. This is the sort of stuff that
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.560]   is so dead easy if you've got a mouse or a trackpad. Again, it's for people who use that feature and
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.040]   take advantage of it. It's going to be great and I don't begrudge that. But it seems like a step
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.760]   backward to say, here's another opportunity for you to take your hands off of the keyboard you're
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.360]   using or another opportunity to do something in a way that's hard to remember and it's going to
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.480]   take a while to learn before it becomes intuitive. When we really just want let us have let us do
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:30.000]   more stuff with a pencil, let us do when we don't have a third another sort of input device.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.040]   And when we do have another sort of input device, make sure the keyboard works
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.120]   amazingly well for selecting and moving stuff and give us a mouse. Finally,
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.800]   you were you Jim, were you at the you were in the keynote, right? Yes,
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.520]   you must have felt for Toby Peterson, the Apple engineer when he just couldn't get
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:53.840]   just just just working. He said, Oops, sorry. Oh, no. It happens in every demo. It has to happen.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.200]   That's what demos do. And yet, I mean, I wouldn't like to stand up there in front of 5,000 people
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.920]   in demo something. I could be nervous. I guess I'd also though shows how I mean,
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.960]   it's very identifiable. It happens to me all the time. I'm trying to do swipe and stuff and
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.560]   it's very feels finicky and fussy. And I don't know if they fixed that.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.520]   Trying to do it all on a piece of software. Yeah, right. That's true.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.840]   Nothing in the fact that we don't know like maybe it maybe it worked one way with one set of
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.320]   gestures up until four days ago. Right. And he had committed that to muscle memory. That's
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.640]   the that's a level of hell that's only reserved for people who were really horrible in previous life.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.000]   Okay, so we'll just take it for granted. I agree with you, Andy. Sometimes these gestures are
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.840]   very hard. Are they're not discoverable? They're hard to remember. And maybe they don't ever get
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.920]   used again, but it's nice that they put them in there. I mean, I think you're only going to have
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:54.800]   to use here. Go ahead, James. I think there's also some of it is, you know, we've grown up with
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:02.320]   using keyboards and you know, our commands, C command, V shortcuts for 30 plus years. I don't
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.120]   want to think about the number. And you know, there are people growing up who are more used to
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.320]   tablets than they are to using keyboards and things. So there's lighting and swiping and
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.960]   three fingers. Three finger and two. I'm never going to remember three finger.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.080]   It's just that we don't we don't see a whole lot of companies that are issuing their people
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:29.760]   tablets when they do issue them tablets like the the touch device that Leo is using. They also
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.000]   get a keyboard and a mouse. So that that is that is an excellent point for consumer level stuff.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.240]   But there's something about the tactile interface that in terms of speed and efficiency,
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.040]   I don't think that anybody has come up with an alternative to it. Apple Apple doesn't have
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.840]   it's not like the iPad is doomed if they don't have mouse support. It's just that they are making
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.080]   so many huge steps forward in making this into something where gosh, why would I even want to have
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.240]   a thousand dollar Windows notebook when I can have for the same amount of money, something that's
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.920]   lighter, sleeker, faster, more secure, more private. And I can do all my work on it just seems like if
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.360]   you add this one thing, it's the one thing that says, Oh, well, that's an argument that I can no
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.880]   longer make against it. Yes, I'm definitely buying an iPad Pro right now. I love it. But speaking of
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:21.040]   few complaints, the biggest thing was the update to files. That is like the biggest pain point that
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:28.960]   I have had as an iPad user is always, I've got a file right here. I've got an iPad right here. I
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   need to get the file into this thing so I can use it. And the ability to simply let's just update
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.920]   the files app to just be able to recognize pretty much anything that's plugged into the USB port.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:46.880]   Let's also make sure that also recognizes samba. So it will just simply mount my file server right
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.200]   on my network. I haven't I haven't used it myself. I don't have the I don't have the dev version
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.720]   installed, but I've been talking to a couple of those who did have installed. They confirmed that
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:01.280]   nope, my SMB share is just completely showed up and just moving things in and out. Oh my goodness,
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.400]   that is just such a luscious feature to have. And the fact that it will even work on my old
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:12.480]   first generation iPad Pro is like, Oh, I was I was so ready to buy a new iPad iPad Pro just to
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:17.040]   get this feature. But oh, well, I guess I'll just keep using my old one. What a what a nice feature.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.680]   It is nice to see that type of seat port used to go ahead, James.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.320]   I believe Steve Troughton Smith plugged in a 10 terabyte Drobo into it.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.440]   He's got all the code on there, right? That is that is good news. That's really good news.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.800]   And of course, photographers have bemoaned the fact that you had to import photos, even if you
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.600]   could attach a card, which you could, but you had to then import the photos into photos and then
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.560]   import it into Lightroom. Even simple things like going directly to Lightroom will make a big
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:54.160]   difference. I'm interested though, in the UI changes. So maybe we can go through some of
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.840]   some of these because ultimately, if you're going to use the iPad as a replacement for a desktop,
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:04.560]   there's a few things. Files for sure, it has to do. But once you get the files in there and you're
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:11.760]   running the apps, you know, the iPad is a full screen interface. But I think Pete Kalk would
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:18.560]   live very happily in slide over, right, James? Yeah, and it does. Yeah. So I think one of the
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:26.160]   things for me is possibly, and for many apps, is being able to create multiple windows and handle
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.640]   them. So you could have, I don't know how useful, but people ask for it, you know, you could have
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.400]   multiple calculators open at once if you're doing two different things. That seems like such a
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.160]   simple thing. Remember, there was a Safari, there was an app that gave you a second Safari,
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.960]   so that you just have two browser windows open. But now it looks like every app,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.920]   is there anything you have to do to Pete Kalk to make? Yeah, I mean, there's work involved in
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.960]   doing this. It's not something you get for free. Is it just just a second instance of your app or?
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:08.400]   It's not quite that, but these, I can't remember the name for them, but there's these objects that
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:15.360]   sort of manage the windows and you just create multiples of those. And, you know, it's going to
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:22.080]   depend on the app, how easy it is for them to add something like that. I can actually understand
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.640]   it because it's not the code you've got on the iPad isn't windowed code per se, or is it? No,
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.600]   but I mean, it is, but there's just one window. There's just one region, you're right into one
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.520]   region. Yeah, and you can create now multiple of them and look after them and create user interface.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.440]   And that sounds like a lot of new code. I don't know. I haven't done it. I don't think it's going
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:51.760]   to be too bad. I think there's some of my underlying code, make some assumptions, which I will need
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:58.320]   to change. But I can see for a lot of apps, it would be quite useful, you know, just being able to have
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:05.040]   multiple mail messages open at once and compare things like that. So I presume all of Apple's apps
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.160]   will support it. I would assume so. I mean, I think there's still some of Apple's apps that
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:17.200]   don't support split screen. So hopefully all of their apps will support. But you have to,
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:22.160]   every third party developer will have to make significant changes to their apps to support.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.360]   That'll be one of the things that we'll all be doing over the summer. Congratulations.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:34.800]   You've got your summer vacation plan. My summer vacation is in December.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:43.440]   Yeah. So, but I'm glad. I mean, that by itself is a significant improvement. The ability to look at
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:51.920]   multiple kind of a recent carousel in slide over, that's fantastic. So I can see what I, you know,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:58.720]   what I've used before. That's as close as you can get with true windowing, I think, on an iOS device.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.920]   Also, I have to say that I never got used to. When they change the way that you could load it,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.600]   you could introduce a slide over or a side-by-side app. I never got the hang of how you make that
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.000]   happen. So I'm glad to see this update to the way it works. So, Jim, you think that maybe at some
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.200]   point it'll become a true windowing operating system? Yeah, I think that with iPad, you know,
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:28.400]   this is one of the things like having iPad OS that frees them up to do some things that
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:36.880]   doesn't make any sense on the iPhone, but for the iPad, it really does. And it helps people be
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:43.200]   more productive. So I would expect to see a lot more features like this. And these features
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:52.080]   be expanded. And, you know, over time, we're going to see what Andy was saying, you know, like an
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:58.000]   operating system for a device that's even more useful than it is now, whether you're using a Mac
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.840]   or an iPad, because essentially it is just a different version of a computer. The operating
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:14.480]   system has a long way to go to meet the expectations that we have for a computer. But this, to me,
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.720]   this shows that they're willing to get there. Yeah. While they killed dashboard, apparently,
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:26.320]   finally, in Catalina, finally, there is no more dashboard. They have added spaces
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.960]   to iPad. I guess they've always been there, the idea that you could swipe back and forth, but now
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:40.080]   you can actually see what spaces are open within an app, which is kind of cool. I think that is a
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.520]   move towards desktop computing in some ways. Is it me or have I've never heard them call it
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.160]   spaces before? That's a Mac OS term. Yeah, interesting. I think telling maybe,
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:11:00.400]   now you've got spaces. Let's see, we talked about the home screen. We talked about the pencil. I'm
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:06.160]   just going through all the new features. Markup is kind of cool. One of the things I really love
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:12.080]   about this Surface Studio is I can double click the top of the pencil or the pen, I guess,
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:19.200]   Microsoft calls it, and take a page and then annotate it, which is a really nice feature for
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.560]   something like this. Well, now you can do that on the iPad too. You can mark up web pages,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:32.240]   but you can even mark up documents as it says right here or email. I can erase it too with the
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.920]   eraser, which I think is going to be very handy. In fact, that's a use case for the iPad that I
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:46.160]   could see just by itself. I think Samsung's note really sold a lot of, Samsung sold a lot of notes
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.840]   just because you could have a pencil and do that on the note. Being able to do this in the iPad
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:55.120]   will be fantastic, I think. There's also a blow up like the note did.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.760]   I think Apple's got that battery technology on a control.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.080]   Yes. It's a bigger device and it's flatter, so there's more room for the battery to bulge.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:12.400]   Yeah, that's right. It's got its own crumple zone for the battery. But we also got that sort of
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.040]   wish on a monkey's paw feature where, okay, you wish for the ability to install fonts on the iPad.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:25.120]   Whoa, yes. You can get them to you. Holy cow. But you will have to buy them through the app
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.600]   store as opposed to taking the font library you've been standardized on for the past 10 years
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.640]   and using that. Was that how they're going to do it? Oh, I could be wrong, but it says get fonts
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.440]   from the app store. You're right. Everything I've seen has said that. There might be a way around
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.480]   it. Again, this is a day old information and a lot of things are being probably said in the
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.200]   greater detail. But I haven't seen anybody in Apple or outside mentioned that you can just get a
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.440]   true type font and throw it in there. I imagine a lot of type plus a lot of type foundries will be
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.600]   celebrating because there's a chance and maybe they'll charge a buck or two bucks, but that's
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:04.560]   going to be a lot of incremental income. Yeah, throw it in an iOS or iPad OS. I got to train
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:11.200]   myself to say iOS or iPad OS app. And you can hopefully anything you've already bought like
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.840]   through comic craft or whatever can be available installed through there. But like I said,
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.840]   a core could be for just a dollar per font. Yeah. I'm sure Apple's happy to get 30% of that
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:29.120]   business as well. You bet. Yep. Always, always. Let's see. So yeah, the fonts are here. Text editing.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.920]   We did talk about these gestures. I don't know if I'm going to really be able to get used to the
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.400]   three finger pinch for copy. And then what is paste? I forgot. I've already forgotten.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:50.720]   You can copy with a three finger spread. Oh, Lord. Yep. So, oh, geez. So you copy with a three
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.760]   finger spread pinch. You paste with a three finger spread and you undo with a three finger swipe left.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.920]   But the good news is we have five fingers. So that gives us lots more
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.880]   capability coming ahead. I just think it's I just think it's mean spirited that all we're doing is
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.760]   talking about new finger gesture features. And now we have to go for the explicit tag on this podcast.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:21.200]   Finger gestures, cursor navigation. That's different. What they've had is you can long press the keyboard
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.520]   and move the cursor around. It sounds like now you can just drag the cursor around on the screen
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:32.480]   and select. And this is all the things that Apple's engineer had a hard time with and intelligence
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:40.640]   text selection, which knows, I guess, sentences, words, and even paragraphs. One tap or two taps for a
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:46.560]   word, three taps for a sentence, four taps for the paragraph. Swipe in the keyboard. Ken
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:52.320]   Cascenda tweeted that they had rejected swipe. He was, of course, the developer of the original
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.600]   iPhone keyboard rejected swipe. They said people don't like it. He was wrong. People love it.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.040]   And Apple now 11, 12 years later is finally putting it on their keyboard. Also, the ability to shrink
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:11.360]   the keyboard down to size. This is and this is perfect for how you use the iPad, where you don't
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:17.440]   necessarily want to reveal an entire keyboard, just to type in a search term or just to do something
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.640]   like that, just the ability to just surface that right below my thumb, let me swipe in the two
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.040]   simple English words and then get out of my way again. That's great. James, do you use the keyboard
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.600]   routines for a peak alc or is it all your? Yeah. Oh, it's got full keyboard support. So you will
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.520]   benefit from this as well, I guess. Well, I mean, not specifically from that little drag around
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:47.360]   keyboard, but oh, come on, you can find something to do with it. I'm sure I can. If you have not used
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.320]   the peak alc about box, just do it. I won't know. No, no, no, spoilers, but just do it. It's
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.000]   you make amazing use of all of I think every single one of Apple's kits.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.480]   I try to. It's a good marketing technique. Yes. Yes. Here's an example of some of the
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:16.320]   keyboard shortcuts for physical keyboards. This is a much increased list of stuff. This is Safari,
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:24.080]   Command L, Command T, Command Shift, and there's tons of them here. Looks like more than 20.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.760]   So that's that's exciting. Fonts we mentioned, the new files app we mentioned.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:36.800]   The support for Microsoft's networking is I presume it'll also support Apple's networking.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.840]   I mean, Apple's networking these days is. Is SMB?
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:49.280]   Yep. Is it really? There's no one. Oh, that's interesting. I think Apple shares been gone for a little
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.760]   while. Oh, has it? Oh, all right. Okay. We'll work with PhoneNet.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:17:00.400]   Let's see. Safari now has a download manager. Really, what they've done is they've made Safari
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.640]   on the iPad desktop Safari. So the features that you like in Safari and the desktop are now here.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.000]   That's that was weird language that I haven't spent much time looking at with the new features of
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.640]   Safari are. But I thought that the entire the even when they introduced the iPad, they said,
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.480]   oh, we will give you a desktop desktop style browsing experience. I don't know what
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:26.480]   distinction they're making between this and what they've been promising before.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.960]   I can tell you one thing because we use Google Docs a lot.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.840]   iPad has historically been terrible with Google Docs. And Google Docs is fault.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.520]   Yeah. They specifically call out Google Docs Squarespace and WordPress web apps saying
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:46.480]   you'll be able to use them now in Safari. Now, look at the size of those touch
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.320]   touch targets in Google Docs. And you'll say, well, maybe I can use it, but
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:58.160]   I don't have to use the pencil to tap those buttons. But at least it'll work, which is a huge
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.360]   improvement. All right. Why is everybody so excited about Darkmore? I thought
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   Adam Anks did a great article about why dark dark mode is bad for you. We're not evolved to use
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.840]   dark mode. Are you a dark mode fan, James Thompson?
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:19.600]   I use dark mode in certain apps at night. Generally, if I'm lying in bed, trying to read
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:26.720]   Twitter or something like that, I don't want my retinas burnt out by the standard interface.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:36.240]   And during the day, I tend not to. So, you know, I don't like on my on my Mac using like
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.840]   Xcode or something like that. I tried it in dark mode for a while. And it just it
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:46.480]   couldn't do it. It doesn't really work for me like that. But I think there's a use case for it. I
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:54.160]   mean, I think there's obviously all of these things. It's accessibility features in some way,
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.600]   you know, and being able to use a phone without blinding yourself is certainly kind.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:08.880]   And it's, you know, it's just more choice. I think you use the default.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.040]   Do you use the default Xcode light theme?
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.480]   Yeah. I mean, like, Xcode just.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.560]   I like solarized themes. Things like a little bit of color in there.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:35.040]   It's got some color, but, you know, I'm focused on the code.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.440]   Your head or something like that. Okay. Well, there you go. How about you, Jim? Are you
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.440]   in a dark mode? You feel like it feels like to me, you'd be a dark mode kind of guy.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:50.400]   You know, you know, what's funny is that when dark mode on my hobby came out, I thought,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:57.280]   this isn't really something for me. I like my Mac the way it is. And that's how I'm going to use
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:06.480]   it. And then when I installed Mojave, I think at the beginning, you get an option to just set
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:11.680]   it to dark mode by default. So I did. I haven't switched it off. Interesting. That's the way it's
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:20.000]   been. I don't think I've seen Mojave in normal mode. Interesting. So I surprised myself with that
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   one. Now, as I think about it, I do think that there are times when normal mode or light mode
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.720]   would be better, especially when a mode side in a working or things like that, dark mode sometimes
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:43.920]   gets a bit tricky to see. But, you know, I've been a fan of dark mode.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.600]   Nice. And of course, it makes sense on the OLED screens, like the iPhone X and XS,
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.640]   Macs because it saves you battery. You don't have to light up dark pixels on those phones.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.520]   I tried dark mode on the Mac for a while and went back to light mode. On the other hand,
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:08.080]   in terminal modes, I always use dark modes. And yeah. So who knows? I guess different strokes for
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:14.000]   different folks. Gardener in our chat room says, "Monotype has issued a statement about fonts.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.200]   In addition to new font licenses, users will be able to sync fonts. They've already licensed
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.840]   from Monotype's e-commerce channel to their device."
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.280]   Awesome.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.520]   If you've already bought fonts and a lot of us have, you'll have access. It sounds like,
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.720]   at least if they're monotype, and I imagine if the monotype does it, everybody else will do it.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.920]   So you can get your personal Helvenica back.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:41.760]   All right. Let's take a little break. Great to have all three of you here. James Thompson is the
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:48.080]   creator of Peacalk, which is legendary. You said, "How long have you been doing that?" 18 years,
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.040]   you said. 27. 27?
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.880]   Is the Mac even at all?
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.160]   Mac does not go on the style.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.040]   Wow.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.960]   Which Mac did you write it for originally?
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.400]   It was originally Mac Classic that I wrote him.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.280]   Wow. And were you were still in school?
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.240]   I wish I was at university.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.520]   University? Well, that's a school of kind. I'm a kind.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.120]   Yeah. I'm possibly older than I seem.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.760]   If you did it on the Mac Classic, did you write it in Pascal?
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.600]   I did indeed.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.520]   Which is why the Panda mascot for Peacalk was called Pascal.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.000]   Oh.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.600]   I'm learning something here.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:35.440]   That's awesome. I remember when Think C came out, that was such an exciting moment.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:41.600]   But I do still miss MPW. Was that what you were using? Probably was, right?
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.560]   No, I was using Turbo Pascal.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.520]   Think Turbo Pascal and Think Pascal.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:54.400]   And then I moved to try and think if I actually used Think C or just went straight to MetroWorks.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.560]   MetroWorks. There was a great compiler.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.920]   Yeah. Those were all so amazing because they were so fast.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.120]   It was just, "Wow. It's done? I didn't even have a chance to get a cup of coffee."
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:11.280]   Andy Inaco also here from the Boston Public Radio, WGBH in Boston.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.400]   And he's in the Boston Public Library right now or some public library.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.640]   I am in part of the wonderful Metro Public Library System.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.040]   Very nice. The advantage of tax dollars at work.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.200]   Well, thank you, taxpayers. Thank you.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.040]   Massachusetts taxpayers.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.680]   Jim Dalrymple, who just can't wait to get back.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.680]   What are you going to do this afternoon? You're going to go over there.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.440]   Are there any particular breakouts or sessions you want to go to?
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.760]   I have a few meetings over at the convention today with developers.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:46.480]   And then at five o'clock, I'm getting together with just kind of an open,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:53.600]   people can come talk and go to a bar and have some fun.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   Do you want to tell people which bar you're going to be at so we can see?
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.520]   Oh, it's the Continental Bar. It's about a block from the Convention Center.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:05.920]   Nice. And you don't go up there and have a few beer and...
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.600]   Say hi to the beer and the beard.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.520]   Yep. Nice.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.920]   It's no chieftain. No, it's not.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.040]   Oh, he knows the bars.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.760]   The chieftain was my bar in San Francisco.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:26.320]   Ah, I think you two might have tipped a few there at one time.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:26.800]   Could be.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.520]   Maywell. I showed you they brought to you by Cap, Terra.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.600]   If you are using antiquated business software, that seems to be the state of the...
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.880]   Microsoft said, "Let's crack me up."
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:45.120]   Their new browser edge based on Chromium, one of the great new features of Edge will be.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.240]   You can run Internet Explorer in a window.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.720]   I knew exactly who that was for.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.000]   There are people out there who are running line of business software that requires IE8.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.560]   Or active desktop.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.440]   And it's because frankly, business software just doesn't get updated.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.720]   Does it? Well, good news.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.240]   There is great business software out there just for you.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:13.520]   Modern business software, on-premises software, web-based software,
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.960]   just for your particular business.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.640]   And you can find it at capterra.com.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.400]   Capterra is software selection simplified.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.120]   If you go there right now, you'll see over 700 categories of business software.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:32.400]   All the big ones, CMS email marketing, SEO, IT service, workflow management.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.960]   We're looking at CRM programs right now.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.800]   That's a great place to start.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.400]   But even if you have a yoga studio or a veterinary office or a dentist's office,
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.000]   no matter what your business, Capterra has the solutions, thousands of programs.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.560]   Pick the program you need, narrow it down by applying filters, product rating,
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.160]   the number of users it supports, deployment style features.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   Get the ones you want, compare them side by side up to forward at a time.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.200]   They'll even show you a list of related categories for further options.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.720]   But I think the killer feature on Capterra is the reviews.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.080]   Over there, getting close to a million reviews now, over 900,000 reviews of products.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.520]   There's a thousand new reviews every single day by actual users.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.160]   They're very careful to verify every single review.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:22.240]   So you're going to get the information you need for people actually using that software
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.920]   to know whether it's the right software for you.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.880]   A better program is waiting for you for your business.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.600]   And the best place to find it is Capterra.com.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.640]   And here's the best part.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.240]   It's free.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.640]   There's no charge, not freemium.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.480]   It's absolutely free.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.960]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.080]   Capterra.com/macbreak.

[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.040]   I know you can go to capterra.com, but please go to capterra.com/macbreak.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.840]   That way they know that you saw it here and that helps us a lot.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.800]   And we thank you, Capterra, for your continued support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.680]   Capterra is software selection simplified.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.800]   Capterra.com/macbreak.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.560]   Yes, they spent time on me mojis.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.000]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.040]   I wanted a long beard me moji.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.000]   There are air pods now.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.520]   There's smokey eyeshadow.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:30.160]   There's the beard.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.240]   Actually, where's the beard?
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.280]   Why no beard?
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.240]   In fact, are you telling me, Jim, if that you do the whole emoji thing
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.520]   and it takes a picture of you, it's a beardless Jim Dalryple?
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.080]   That's shocking.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.400]   Well, there's no long beard in there.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.360]   That's just shocking.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:45.920]   We got to fix that.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.720]   That's terrible.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.200]   It's not even on all on the screen.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.800]   I know, it's so long it can't actually fit.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.320]   That may be the reason.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.000]   You need one of those 6K screens and turn it sideways.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.120]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:01.840]   It was interesting.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.240]   They brought two YouTube makeup stars on to demo the memeojis.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.880]   Now, don't get it.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.200]   No, I think that's correct.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.440]   I think it's good.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.360]   It's reaching out to women, right?
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.880]   I think it's like, yeah, making the whole thing not just about people who look like us.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:27.120]   But doing that and things like all the piercings and stuff,
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.800]   allowing people to customize their stuff.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.440]   No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.320]   It wasn't the presence of piercings and makeup.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.800]   It was like, oh, no, Instagram influencers on the...
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.480]   I remember when Tony Bennett was on that stage, young man.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.320]   Oh, you are an old timer.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.200]   When the 19th, it is not.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.880]   But speaking of representation, is it brand new that you can add a hijab?
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.360]   You can add a sheet term?
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.600]   They started doing that in emojis,
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.480]   but I'm glad to see that, yeah, you can do that in emojis.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.960]   As well as gaps in your teeth, missing teeth, gold teeth, braces,
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:09.360]   facial and ear piercings, hats, glasses, even air pods.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:16.720]   This and the fact that you can now track your cycle on the Apple Watch
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.240]   is shows that it isn't a male-dominated world anymore.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.000]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.880]   I think it's a step in the right direction.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:25.600]   I think it's a bit there.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.160]   We're getting there.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.280]   It's bit by bit.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:27.840]   Right.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.400]   Right.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.160]   You didn't see a lot of women in the audience.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.800]   Although, I think there are more female developers now than ever before.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.760]   I hope so, anyway.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:40.560]   But that's particularly an important thing for Apple to be able to promote.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.440]   Not all these health features that are...
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:48.960]   If Apple is going to dunk on everybody about privacy,
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.200]   the ability to benefit from health tracking and making sure that that is not being
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:58.240]   harvested and sold to third parties, that is one of the hugest reasons to get an Apple Watch
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.160]   on top of all the technical reasons.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:06.720]   Just over the weekend, I was considering buying a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.560]   because I'm taking a brain pill that you might want to take a look at your blood pressure.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.160]   I have no blood pressure problems.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:17.920]   But I instantly, like I said, looking at all the privacy policies where all I want
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.320]   is one that will not... I don't have to sign up for an app and I don't have to agree to
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.080]   some licensing agreement that says that we will share information with other people.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.120]   And it's like, nope, I don't... Medically, I don't need this.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.720]   And so therefore, I don't want this.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.480]   I gave up on privacy so long ago.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.720]   I actually tweet my blood pressure now.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.360]   Automatically, my blood pressure gets tweeted.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.800]   Just saying.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   We're in a new world, Leo.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:47.360]   What puzzles me is there's several thousand people following that Twitter feed.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.960]   I don't know why anybody would care.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.240]   Apple, though, did really double down on privacy.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.120]   Apple, I think now, is making this part of their business model.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.440]   For instance, iOS 13 has a new feature.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:03.280]   I missed this slide, but Zach Whittaker called it out on TechCrunch.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.040]   You can limit application access to just once.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.680]   That's fascinating.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.280]   I mean, you can open up a Maps app and say, "Just this once, tell me where I am."
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.120]   That's the other thing.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.440]   The other thing, the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protection is very interesting because
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:25.680]   there's apps like Facebook, for example, that you don't realize are querying the Bluetooth
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:31.200]   devices and things you have connected and what Wi-Fi networks are around you and stuff like that.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:37.520]   And if you install those apps now on the beta and you run it, it says, "Do you want to let
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.200]   Facebook have access to these things?"
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:39.200]   No.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.120]   It's like, "No, I really don't."
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.760]   Facebook would like to know every IoT device in your home.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.480]   Do you mind?
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.160]   No, I do.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.600]   Yeah, I mind.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.200]   A new home kit security for cameras to make that even more secure.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.800]   Now, I have to wonder how many camera companies are going to sign up.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:03.920]   They mentioned three anchors, U-Fi, Logitech and NetAtmo.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:09.200]   But you know Google and their Nest cameras, there's no way in the world they're going to sign up for
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:14.080]   that because partly because these cameras make money with the monthly subscription.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.760]   Apple's offering what was it?
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.520]   10 days of recordings free.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.880]   But that's such a good thing to sell your camera on.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.320]   That those of you who use Apple products that care about privacy,
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:32.240]   if you try to compete with Nest, you're not going to have a good time of it.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:37.040]   Try to compete with all these $20 cameras that are Amazon deals of the day.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.480]   You're not going to have a good time of it.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.600]   But if you're saying that we believe in Apple's privacy system,
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.280]   and so therefore we're one of a handful of cameras that cares more about you,
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.520]   the customer, than about harvesting data.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.000]   But we also make cameras that will harvest your data.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.080]   You have the choice.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.680]   Or if you're really down with that, that would be awesome.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.480]   I mean, it's not merely harvesting the data.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.800]   I mean, these cameras make money on the monthly subscriptions.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:08.000]   I spent a lot of money on Nest subscriptions, and that would cut those
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.320]   ancillary income out for those cameras.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.520]   Although there are companies like Wise who've come along to the YZE,
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.160]   who give you this without a subscription fee, and the cameras are 20 bucks,
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.000]   10 bucks, whatever, 30 bucks.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.880]   So maybe there is a little competition going on in this.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.160]   The other thing Apple announced that I wonder how many people will sign up for
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.760]   is a new single sign-on.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:37.600]   So if you've seen sign up with Twitter, do you, James, do you do that with a peacock?
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.600]   Do you use sign up with Google, Facebook, Twitter?
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:45.920]   No, there's no need for an account because I don't keep any information.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.560]   It's a lot easier to not have any privacy problems if you don't keep any information.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.920]   I don't know and I don't want to.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:58.160]   But what I think is very interesting about this is if you use any of these,
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.920]   like, sign on with Google and sign on with Facebook and your app,
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.200]   you have to include the sign-on with Apple.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.320]   They're making it mandatory if you use any of these 3D.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.120]   That's interesting.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.120]   So that is going to...
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:21.600]   A lot of these features seem designed to thwart the ad tracking companies.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.640]   And I'm all for it.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.520]   I love the...
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:33.040]   I don't want to give them my email address, so give them this random string of numbers
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.600]   as an email address, and that will eventually get to me.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:39.600]   But I can switch it off and they don't actually have my real email address.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.520]   So all that stuff looks really good.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.440]   This is how Apple gets people to use it.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.240]   They require it.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:51.520]   Yes, but by using the big bat that they can hit the developers with.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.440]   I always avoided this.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.320]   Single sign-on because it became an issue for me when I killed my Facebook account
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.000]   and I had a lot of stuff and I couldn't sign into it anymore.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.720]   So that taught me the lesson, use your email to do this.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.920]   But I think a lot of...
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.760]   Most people who have Apple IDs are probably going to keep their Apple ID for some time.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:17.920]   And the idea that you can use an email that's hidden is probably very attractive.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:23.200]   Yeah, I'm keen to see how that works because sometimes I don't...
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.840]   I want to actually have access to certain stores that do...
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.160]   They're annoying me by sending me an email every day,
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:34.720]   but once out of the month there will be a special offer code for something I actually need.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.320]   Well, still the email still goes to you.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.520]   Apple forwards is you.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.400]   But what I'm interested in is, does it have to go to the email that's associated with your Apple ID?
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:48.480]   Or can I create a burner address on Gmail or something for like just offers,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.400]   Andy's offers at whatever.com.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.360]   So...
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.200]   So buy-neas on top of buy-neas.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:53.440]   Yes.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.160]   I'm behind seven proxies.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:56.960]   Try to find me.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:06.160]   Sign-in with Apple makes it easy for users to authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:11.360]   That also is great instead of a password and has two-factor authentication built-in
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.080]   for added layer security.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.640]   So that is great, but it does not require IRS or a macOS to use it.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:23.680]   But I guess you have to have an Apple ID otherwise you can't use it.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.240]   So that...
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.920]   I think this is smart.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.760]   Apple's really doubling down.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.640]   They're becoming the privacy company.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.960]   Google Fireback at their developer conference, as Underpitch I said,
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.600]   does privacy shouldn't be a luxury item.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.560]   But Google's not exactly known for privacy.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.920]   So I'm not sure how that applies.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.920]   It does.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:48.960]   Well, it doesn't.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.760]   It does.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.960]   Now, Jim's answer.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.920]   Google has other ways of handling this.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:59.760]   But yeah, both companies, like every time they go and do an absolute like that,
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.240]   I'm like, "Oh, dear, don't fight with Apple over privacy.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.120]   I do the Google.
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.760]   I know that you do the best you possibly can.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:10.240]   You care about it up to the point where it affects business.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.160]   And Apple, I know that you like to say, "Hey, we are completely private,
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.520]   except for all the apps that you download and use and except for the websites you visit."
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.280]   But other than that, completely private.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.600]   Like, just let's just agree that Apple is better than Google at this,
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.360]   but both have room for improvement.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:34.160]   There were other restrictions, I believe, on tracking stuff in apps used by kids and things like that.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.760]   Yeah, Apple announced today that they are going to allow the
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:43.280]   kid, the screen time utilities that they had previously blocked from using MDM.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:48.240]   They're going to allow them to do it as long as they don't send details about
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.160]   the user back to their servers.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.560]   So companies that are offering these parental control features
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.240]   will now be able to go back to using those MDM certificates.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.680]   There are a lot of cool tipbits in there.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.240]   They finally added just a spam call blocker,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.760]   if an incoming call number is not in your contact database anywhere,
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.840]   it will just automatically kick a device mail.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:16.320]   Simplest thing ever, but it's such a complete solution to annoyances.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.880]   There is a nice feature on Google's Pixel phones where you can press a button that says,
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.600]   "Send the, you know, get the screen this guy.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.440]   I don't want to know if I don't think he's real."
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.000]   But, and of course, a lot of carriers are now offering features like that, some free, some paid.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.680]   But for Apple to do it is probably pretty important.
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.160]   So the carriers sell your numbers to telemarketers, and then they charge you to screen-
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:40.640]   Lock it.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.840]   The telemarketers.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.320]   Brilliant.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.080]   It's a profit deal, I think.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:44.720]   Yeah, I'm cool.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.640]   [laughter]
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.760]   Photos has been updated.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.000]   I didn't see anything, you know, crazy exciting, except perhaps the fact that
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.440]   all the tools that you use in still photos can now be used on videos,
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.240]   including rotating the video.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.680]   That was in quick time years ago, I remember.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.080]   I used it a lot, but you had to have QuickTime Pro.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.040]   So this is, that's good.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.800]   I think there are a lot of people with a video that needs to be rotated or fixed.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.840]   Any of the filters that you have in photos can also be used on video, which is pretty neat.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.720]   And I think they're also the other thing that kind of caught my eye.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:26.800]   They're adding a lot of really nice, sort of like finer-grained editing tools to the photos app.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.320]   One of them is noise reduction.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.360]   And came to see how well that works.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.320]   I know that the iPhones already do a huge amount of really effective noise reduction
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:43.680]   before they even write the file. But the ability to just reduce like color noise
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:50.960]   is just such a big, big deal, particularly when the iPhone still have a weakness with low light
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.440]   video. They haven't really come up with a really, really great solution to that yet.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.400]   But if that's one of the bag of tricks you can do when you tap on just auto fix this,
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.480]   that's going to make a lot of people really happy.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.400]   Speaking of privacy, I've just learned, thank you ScooterX in our chat room.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.920]   Tim Cook will be on the CBS Evening News tonight from WWDC.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.680]   Here's a little clip that they posted from that interview about privacy.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.160]   Can you hear it?
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.120]   With that new innovation of that Apple sign on, I thought,
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.400]   this is Apple taking a shot at the way Facebook and Google is using all of our data.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.400]   You know, we're not really taking a shot at anybody.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.000]   We focus on the user.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.480]   And the user wants the ability to go across numerous properties on the web
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:42.720]   without being under surveillance. We're moving privacy protections forward.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.640]   And I actually think it's a very reasonable request for people to make.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.000]   Do you think Facebook cares about our private security?
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.880]   I think that everybody's beginning to care more.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.960]   People are becoming more and more of that.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.400]   That was super diplomatic.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:57.920]   Many people are getting more offended.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.640]   I think this is going on.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.960]   Thank goodness you wasn't drinking a sip of water in that question.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:08.000]   You can imagine an environment where everyone begins to think there's no privacy.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.640]   And if there's no privacy, your freedom of expression just plummets.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.920]   Because now you're going to be thinking about that everybody's going to know
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.520]   every single thing you're doing.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.560]   This is not good for our country, not good for democracy.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.360]   I agree.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.400]   That's CBS Evening News, Nora O'Donnell, the anchor interviewing Tim Cook.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.320]   It'll appear on The News Tonight on CBS, the full interview.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:37.520]   Tim has the ultimate diplomat, but he can let the products speak for themselves.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:43.280]   I had a question for you.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.440]   Let's see, James.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.360]   Oh, performance.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:55.040]   They weirdly began the iOS segment by talking about how much faster
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.800]   the new iOS would be, which puzzled me a little bit.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.280]   I mean, they did that last year as well.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.360]   They had a big focus on performance.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.480]   That's why it puzzled me.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.720]   It's like, but didn't you just make a fair saying?
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.840]   They're saying, like, we got better.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.360]   We did even more.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:18.320]   Just for hearing that like Face ID was 30% faster or something,
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.640]   I thought, well, you know, that affects me a lot.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.440]   My phone a lot.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.360]   So, you know, this is good.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.080]   Do you know how they're making apps launch twice as fast and be smaller in size?
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.240]   Is there a new format?
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.560]   I don't think there's a new format.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:38.000]   I mean, I think some of the space savings are then not downloading as much as they
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.440]   as they previously did.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.760]   So, they're thinning out the apps.
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.960]   I'm not 100% sure on the details on that.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.880]   How do they make this stuff launch faster is just there's a lot of extremely clever people
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.720]   who sit there for a long time, working out how to shave a couple of milliseconds
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.240]   of some system code.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.680]   Okay.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:57.120]   Wow.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.480]   It's impressive because it is the same processor.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.880]   It's the same, you know, storage speed.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.600]   So, it's all being done by better code, I guess.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.200]   Yeah, better code.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.040]   And like once you can make the compiler generate better code,
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:18.880]   then, you know, the benefits like trickle down to everyone.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:22.240]   Like when we recompile our apps, we'll get faster stuff as well.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.560]   Siri has a new voice.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.080]   Did you like Siri's new voice?
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.080]   This sounded really good.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.000]   That's the best text to speech I've heard.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.240]   Let me play a little bit of what they did is they had Siri read a very
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.080]   turgid scientific description from, I guess, from Wikipedia.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:40.480]   And then...
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.000]   Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale,
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.560]   a state at which the end Valpe, an entropy of a cooled ideal gas reached their minimum value.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.440]   Taken as zero.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.960]   That's the old Siri.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.160]   All right, so that's okay.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.520]   But now let's try iOS 13 with neural text to speech.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:03.840]   Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale,
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.800]   a state at which the end Valpe, an entropy of a cooled ideal gas reached their minimum value.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.600]   Taken as zero.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.360]   That's impressive.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.680]   Still not intelligible, but...
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.240]   Still, still, still, still, still, still, still baffling.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.800]   I understood the words.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.640]   What it actually meant.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.440]   They're doing...
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:27.840]   This is something Google does as well, which is take the generated text and then apply a human cadence
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.000]   and phrasing to it.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000]   Google has a term for it, which I've forgotten.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.200]   By applying that, then they can get it to sound much more natural, and it does.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:38.240]   It sounds very good.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:45.360]   The basic idea is that instead of taking pre-cooked waveforms and sticking them together
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.760]   to produce a speech, they're basically synthesizing the entire waveform from start to finish.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.680]   And the difference is just immediate.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:45:01.680]   It's interesting how parallel the developments are at Google and Apple, just down the road a bit.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.160]   Many of the things they showed really are very similar to what Google's been showing.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.280]   Well, that's because everybody who's doing research and AI, they want to publish.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.040]   They want to be able to discuss their advances with other people.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.360]   So this is one place where to an extent everybody's building the same
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.120]   features and improvements for every platform out there.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:23.680]   So yeah.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.640]   Jim, did you get that nice coat, the jacket, the WWDC jacket?
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.920]   Yes.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:30.480]   That is a...
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.280]   Perversible.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.320]   I love the inside.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.920]   The lining is so cool.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.480]   So half of the people were wearing them inside out and half were wearing them regular.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.880]   Oh, we have a visitor in the studio.
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.240]   You got the orange one, eh?
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:51.360]   This is the lining, which is from the invitation to the event, WWDC.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.000]   It's a very subtle jacket on the outside.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.320]   It's just in fact, you could barely read the WWDC.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.720]   Are you going to wear an insider outside?
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.040]   I think you should wear the orange.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.880]   That makes me want to go to WWDC.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.400]   Now, James, do you wish you'd gone?
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.080]   That is a beautiful jacket.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:16.320]   I feel like I could still save a lot of money by buying that on eBay.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.960]   Just with airfare alone.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.440]   Yeah, not as much as you think.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.200]   Those things go for quite a bit.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:23.840]   True.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:26.960]   Premium, premium product.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.120]   Let's see, maps.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.840]   It sounds like a lot of people interpreted it
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.440]   that Apple is now driving around all over the United States, creating
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.040]   LIDAR maps of the US.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.560]   They did mention the word LIDAR.
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.280]   So they've got Street View.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.440]   Okay, Google's had that for some time.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.600]   But what are they using the LIDAR for?
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.320]   More detailed maps.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:53.520]   Yeah, or preparing for self-driving vehicles.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:56.080]   That too.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.560]   But a lot of the LIDAR is just used to identify
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:05.680]   features of a certain block that will help you target images
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.600]   that you can pull information from.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.480]   So if you know that that's not just a poster,
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:14.000]   that's actually a door, you can actually look at that door to find
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.240]   to look for an address marker.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.480]   Or if you're going around and you're trying to find out,
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.680]   this is definitely the right address.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.160]   But I don't, this is one of those big buildings.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.000]   I don't know where the entrance is.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.840]   If you're just looking at a flat image,
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.200]   that's a small bit of information to code to tell from.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.280]   But if you've got LIDAR, you can figure out exactly.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.400]   That looks like a door.
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.920]   Let's examine that for more data.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.840]   You're just ruining my completely ruining my conspiracy theory.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.200]   They did show off the ability that's--
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.920]   Leo, Leo, if I were under NDA on Apple's non-linear project,
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.640]   I would certainly not talk about that, would I?
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:51.600]   Well, the truth is we've seen these cars ride around,
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.360]   and people have identified-- in fact,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.320]   I just saw an article from Leander Connie from three years ago,
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.120]   where he said, "That's LIDAR on those Apple Maps vans."
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.320]   And they did have that one feature the Street View doesn't have.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.640]   It was kind of blew me away that the presenter showed us going up
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.080]   through China, Taddison, and San Francisco.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.480]   Google's done this for years.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.600]   What do you mean?
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.640]   But she did then turn, and you could get information about the store.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.920]   It was highlighted right on the store.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:19.760]   So maybe that's what the LIDAR is being used for.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.880]   That was pretty cool.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.480]   There's a lot of really great features there that I think the point is that
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:30.640]   it's not that Apple Maps has to be absolutely 100% as good as Google Maps,
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.160]   but it just needs to adapt a bunch of features like Street View,
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.360]   like having really in-depth information about what is here,
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:42.720]   block to block to block to get people to dip into Google Maps less frequently.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:50.080]   It really is one of the few Google Apps that is kind of a must-have on any Apple device.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.200]   And if they just simply make Apple Maps a little bit better,
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.200]   then they can just simply get people to put off downloading it enough times
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.720]   they'll forget they ever needed it.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.640]   So there's really cool stuff going on there.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.320]   And the images do look a lot better.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.520]   They should have side-by-side.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:06.240]   Apple's also updating its car play to compete,
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:08.000]   I think a little bit better with Android Auto.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.200]   CarPlay, the Passives, just been a grid of icons,
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.720]   but now they have a little bit more information on the screen,
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.400]   even while you're looking at Maps and other things.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.800]   That's, I think, a good thing.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.880]   CarPlay is now according to Renee Ritchie,
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.400]   in 90% of cars sold in the US.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.400]   So that's pretty impressive.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.800]   And Pandora and Waze are now part of CarPlay.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.560]   A page they took from Spotify,
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.000]   the ability to audio share with AirPods.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:39.760]   So two pairs of AirPods can pair to one iPad and hand off to a HomePod.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:41.040]   That was the Spotify feature.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.000]   I think you walk through the door,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000]   hold your iPad close to your HomePod,
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000]   and it'll start playing the music you've been listening to
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.320]   on your phone or a tablet.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.520]   Anything else people you guys are excited about?
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.400]   Well, one thing I'll tell you right now, James Thompson,
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.960]   that plan that you had to do a better reminders app than Apple,
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.240]   you might as well just forget that.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.840]   They've completely rewritten reminders from scratch,
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.960]   and it looks fantastic.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.200]   It looks a little like Google Keep, actually,
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.520]   but serious suggestions in there and all of that.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.280]   James, was there anything that you've seen at WWDC
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.320]   that we didn't mention that you thought would be important to?
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.560]   I mean, from a developer perspective,
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.320]   the biggest thing that they announced was the SwiftUI framework,
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.240]   because that's basically,
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:31.200]   that's what we're going to be using probably in five to 10 years.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.160]   They basically turned around and said,
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.520]   "You know all that code you've written?"
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:36.000]   Forget it.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.560]   But I mean, they have done it in such a way that you can sort of
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.200]   start adopting it slowly.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.360]   It makes me want to learn Swift, I have to say.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.960]   Well, put me out of a job.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.400]   No, I won't put you out of a job.
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.840]   The best calculator in the world is already available.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.640]   There's no reason to write another one, it's Pete Kalk.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.760]   I actually was really impressed by the MoCap.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.040]   They were doing it.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.560]   Yeah, there was a lot of that AR stuff.
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:10.080]   I mean, again, it's the strange level of investment in AR
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.440]   through a phone screen that doesn't entirely make sense.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:19.040]   So, you know, there's clearly Apple is building to something.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:25.680]   And I look forward to AR when it's not somebody holding up a phone.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.640]   Yes, yes.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:29.360]   That's not what I want to do.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.480]   It's clear with both Apple's and Google stuff that they are building out
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:40.320]   all the software so that if and when they develop some sort of a camera device
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.320]   that you can wear without feeling like a dork,
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.880]   everything else will be ready to just install on it.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:49.520]   They were doing some really amazing stuff though with the ability to walk around
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.800]   among AR devices.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.560]   The occlusion works better.
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.920]   Everything works a lot better.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:58.080]   And I think a testament to how well it works that they're starting to move this down to
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.880]   A9 processors, so older iPhones without those special cameras.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.960]   That's big.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.160]   Jim Dowerimple, anything you think we should talk about that we didn't mention from WWDC?
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:15.120]   You know, I think we covered all of the important stuff that happened.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:21.360]   But I think what everybody needs to realize is that the stuff we talked about
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.360]   is just barely scratching the surface.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.240]   I think so, yeah.
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:32.560]   There was so much announced or so much in these releases that they couldn't even get to.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:41.840]   And you know, for developers like James, they look far deeper than what we do when we
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.640]   take a look at these releases.
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.400]   We take a look at the big features.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:53.600]   They go into the APIs and the code and they figure out what new apps they're going to build them.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:59.760]   And this is what pushes the developer community forward and what pushes Apple forward.
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.360]   And that's the important part that comes out of WWDC, I think.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:09.280]   So it's very interesting for us to sit back and look at these features.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:14.720]   But man, the stuff that we didn't even get talked about is what's going to drive the company.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:21.360]   Plus, remember that this is the new version of iOS, the new version of macOS, the new version of
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.760]   iPadOS. They're not coming out until September.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.960]   This is just the stuff that they were able to show us right now.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.960]   So we got a lot of surprises waiting for us.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:34.560]   Andy, I have found the WWDC 2019 limited edition reversible jacket.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.760]   If you want red, it'll set you back $900.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:41.440]   Blue is $1000.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.000]   That doesn't want to stand right.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:47.520]   Well, they got they got to make their money back somehow.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:52.160]   If I somebody selling his black and black for only $149.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.280]   I wonder, can that?
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.120]   Oh, wait a minute. It's just gone up to 650.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.360]   That was a that was a big.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.320]   That was a moment.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:53:59.680]   I'll make I'll make an offer.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.840]   I'll I'll trade a package of unopened game of Thrones Oreos for one.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.560]   Another really limited collectible.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.960]   All right.
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:15.040]   I know Jim Dalrymple wants to get back to WWDC.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:19.200]   So let's get the let's get the pics of the week in just a moment.
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.800]   Gentlemen, it's great to have you here.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:26.560]   It's like we couldn't pick a better team to do coverage of WWDC than James Thompson of P.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.000]   Calc fame.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.800]   If you don't have P. Calc on your Apple watch on your iPhone on your iPad on your Mac,
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.880]   why not get it now?
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:39.200]   Jim Dalrymple loop insight.com.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.600]   No need to fear the beard.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.560]   It's but we do want it in a me emoji.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.280]   And from Boston with radio Andy and not co.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.160]   I think there should be I think I think mutton chops might also be a nice me emoji feature.
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.200]   And you know, they got coverage.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.760]   They can say that, oh no, it's a it's it's for science fiction authors.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.360]   Yeah, it's the asthma.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.960]   They don't have to say it's about me.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.480]   But I'll take it anyway.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:06.800]   I think it'd be really nice to have a slider.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:12.320]   It's a facial hair slider that you slide down and the beard just kind of slowly grows down
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:15.680]   your face and down your chest and then that's him officer.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:16.240]   That's the one.

[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.800]   It's beautiful meditative music.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:04.400]   I know a lot of coders like to listen to lyric free music while they're focusing while they're
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.040]   working. Calm has it all calm.com/macbreak.

[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.080]   C-A-L-M.com/macbreak.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.680]   We thank them so much for their support and for keeping me calm.
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.480]   Do you ever listen to music James while you're coding?
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.840]   Yeah, and it's exactly that.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:35.920]   I prefer stuff with no lyrics so I've got lots of instrumental playlists of stuff.
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:40.000]   I can't listen to podcasts at all.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.920]   No, no, it's distracting her books.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.440]   Yeah, no, it's too distracting.
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:49.360]   I remember reading that Baroque music was particularly good for focus but I think a lot of the kind of
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.560]   smooth stuff that they have on calm is also very good.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.200]   The other thing is listen to lots of stuff with lyrics that aren't in English because
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:59.600]   it doesn't engage the language that does in your brain.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:00.080]   Right.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:03.360]   So lots of J-pop and K-pop and whatever else.
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:09.120]   James, is there anything you'd like to pick besides P-Calc as a picker than me?
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:12.240]   I don't think it would be fair to pick my own app for this.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:18.160]   I would like to focus on some of the other apps that got Sherlocked.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:25.200]   So we talked about the lunar display and duet and things but I'd like to focus on
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:30.480]   Vignette by Casey List which adds photos to your content.
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.640]   Casey released that 20 minutes ago.
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.280]   I don't understand how they could have Sherlocked him so fast.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:40.320]   I think it was clearly they were both working on things in parallel.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:44.640]   It was not targeted specifically at Casey but still it's a good app.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:50.560]   I installed it, I happily paid my money and you can try it and see how many of the pictures it
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:55.440]   gets for your contacts without paying anything and then if you want to copy all the pictures over then
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:58.000]   then you have to give them some of his hard-earned money.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.800]   I'm going to buy Vignette just to support Casey.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.360]   That's just, I mean, good lord.
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:06.480]   Anyway, that's a very good point.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:13.760]   CaseyList.com if you want to read about Vignette, C-A-S-E-Y, L-I-S-S, released May 22nd,
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:15.040]   Sherlock's June 3rd.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:20.640]   Can I PayPal him a hug?
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:22.720]   I'd like to do that.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:27.200]   Brilliant idea.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.800]   You can see that Apple didn't take it from him.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:34.960]   I think it does still do things that Apple stuff doesn't do because it's pulling
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:36.720]   stuff off Gravatar and all this.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.120]   It starts with Gravatar.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.680]   It's got Twitter, it's Facebook, it's got Instagram.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:46.240]   I think this is a better way to do it with Vignette.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:49.520]   Honestly, you could get a better picture of Christina Warren.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:50.160]   I'm just saying.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:55.680]   Jim Dowrympel, you got some rock and roll for us today?
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:57.120]   You know what?
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:03.760]   I learned from the last time that I was on the show that people really enjoyed taking a step back.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.320]   You mentioned Metallica last time, which was so much fun.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.120]   ACDC.
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:08.240]   Or ACDC, that's right.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:08.800]   Yeah.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:17.440]   So for the party that I had at WWDC last night, I had to build a playlist for when the band wasn't on.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:27.440]   And what I decided to do was build a playlist that as it turned out, there was only one song
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.960]   that was released after 1980 or '81.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:40.800]   So what I really enjoyed about that playlist is going back and listening to some of the great
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:51.520]   legendary bands. So today, the Rolling Stones, but the Rolling Stones from mid to late 60s,
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:01:01.920]   maybe early 70s, at the most. And two of the songs that I had on there were Get Off of My Cloud,
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:04.800]   which is one of my favorite all-time Stones songs.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:13.680]   And Give Me Shelter. Yeah. To me, that really shows some songwriting that
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:22.080]   was magnificent. The musicianship, the songwriting, everything in there was just
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:35.280]   such a high level. I loved it. So I actually, I had to kick out songs that I had a few hours
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.200]   of music and I only needed 30 minutes. So there was a lot of great stuff in there.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.360]   So to me, that kind of touched me last week.
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:50.720]   That must be a fun thing to do, actually. I never thought about that. The loop bash was last
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:56.240]   night. Sorry if you missed it, but I'm sure it was a fantastic party as it is every year.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:59.120]   It was. Yeah. And look for...
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.600]   I'm glad your pick of the week isn't a bail bondsman.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.800]   And you know, if you ever in trouble in Santa's A...
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.640]   And we should mention Jim is going to be at a bar again tonight.
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.480]   What was the name of it again? Continental.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:20.960]   Continental. And just down the road from the mechanical if you want to say hi to the beard.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:24.320]   Thank you for being here, Jim. I really appreciate it. I know you take a time off from
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:29.520]   some important work. Sorry I was late. No, I think now that I realized you had your party last
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:35.440]   night, I understand. Have a great one, Jim. We really appreciate it.
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.200]   Andy, you're not co. What do you got for us?
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:44.320]   Mine is an easy one, honoring the great new files app for iPadOS that lets you just stick
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.960]   something into the USB port and suddenly mount it. This has been in my pocket since I bought a
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:56.000]   couple months ago. It's Sanddisc's Ultra Dual Drive. And one end of it is a USB A. And if you
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:02.240]   flick the switch the other way, you get a USB C. And so it's the simplest way possible to get
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:08.800]   something off of one device and put it onto a phone or put it onto something else. Not terribly
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.200]   expensive. I got the 256 gig model. So part of that means that my entire music library is about
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:21.920]   100 gigs, 110 gigs. So I have that plus so much enough stores that I can have lots of movies I
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:27.040]   want to watch. Lots of lots of like backup files for pretty much anything. My presentation for
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:32.640]   wherever I'm going will land on this. And it's nice and compact, so small that so long as you
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:38.240]   don't have a minimalist wallet, I actually have this inside a little flap inside my wallet at all
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:43.440]   times. USB 3.0, of course, so it's super super fast. And you can format it so that it's just
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.920]   Mac OS, of course, you can format it so that it'll work with pretty much any device you ever come
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:53.040]   across. So my pick of the week. I remember having Steve Wozniak on the old screen savers in the
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:58.560]   early 2000s. And he wore a USB drive around his neck. I think it was probably a gigabyte.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:05.680]   I said, I have everything I need is on here. I always have it. I'm sure it cost $1000 back in
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:15.920]   those days. We were all that's a gigabyte. Wow. That's amazing. Hey, I oh, Roberto. Thank you.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:22.240]   Roberto Hoya throw boy because he has a new line and he sent me everything from the new line.
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:28.800]   These are pillows, throwy boy pillows from the good old days. This they can't use the real name.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:34.880]   So this is and you'll just know what it is. 2007. I'll give you a hint. It has a headphone jack.
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:43.520]   I love this pillow. This is 1977. It's it. I don't know if it's an Apple II or II C. I don't know.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:47.520]   Oh my God. Look at that. I used to fall asleep and drool on the real thing when I was a kid at
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:53.040]   late. This is my soft pillow from 2001 comes something that looks amazingly like the original
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:05:01.760]   iPod. And yes, you can. It has firewire. Sort of. This is one of my favorites.
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:10.400]   This. Thank you. This is so great. Look at the Bondi blue sort of I Mac pillow 1998. What a year
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:17.840]   including that very expensive CD. Steve wanted a slot, but the team said, no, you can't have it.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:22.960]   No, but one of the few times Steve didn't get what he wanted. And this of course is going to
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:29.680]   go home with me. This is everybody's favorite from 1984. Why 1980?
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:34.800]   We're one like 1984. Go ahead. Try to throw a sledgehammer through it. Just try.
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:40.880]   Hey, thank you everybody for being here. Thank you to James and Jim and Andy.
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:45.520]   Thanks to a great studio audience, great big studio audience of people who obviously were

[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:37.200]   if he would buy the new Mac Pro. He can't be with us. He's busy right now, but he said,
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:43.280]   I'm buying as many as I can afford, but I may have to take out a second mortgage.
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:53.200]   I'm buying as many as I can afford to zero. Thanks everybody. We'll see you next time.
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:07:03.360]   But now I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
