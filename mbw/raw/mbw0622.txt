[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.360]   Renee Richie who is in fact the top journalist in the Macintosh space at i'm more calm. Hello Renee
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.120]   Aylio, how are you doing doing great as you can see my eGPU has not exploded
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.360]   No, my i9 Mac book pro is not burst into flame
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.400]   All's right with the world and your keyboard hasn't failed yet. Well, okay. No attention to this keyboard. Oh
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   Folger
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.400]   Now I gotta put it right back isn't that genius no crumbs on this
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.160]   mm-hmm and
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.560]   In our codes here. He's actually here with
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.440]   Alex Lindsey they're together
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   So this puts the rest all the rumors that you two are the same person
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   We did a lot of work on that it's actually a cloning technology that we've
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.120]   You'll know that's either real or fake depending on how smoothly I can pass this object
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.760]   Wow that almost looked real
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.960]   Great so what brings you to DC Andrew
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.840]   I'm seeing a person who's gonna brief me about a thing that I can't talk about and also to see Alex's wonderful new digs
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.160]   And also I've never been an 8k before
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.920]   Every frame like at least that we're capturing here is like 30 megapixels. Yes
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.560]   Unbelievable
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.120]   This is actually I think the first public stream that we've done with this studio
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.200]   I think the guys I go to the wide shot here. I'll show you Alex Lindsey
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.640]   And his new new broadcast studio and Washington
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.240]   Wow, so we just built we just finished building this and
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.360]   It's been many months of pain as you know because you built a studio so you know what that means
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.600]   Yeah, but you got it. That's nice and is this for a project you're working on or you gonna rent this out?
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   What's the what's we're planning to rent it out planning?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   I mean we've got a couple you know
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.600]   We've got lots of clients here in DC that want to be able to do their broadcast and so we
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.080]   Podcasts mostly here
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.360]   No, I think mostly live. I mean but podcasts as well
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.520]   But I think that we're gonna do a lot of live work
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   I mean we're connected to all the broadcasters and you know here and sat dishes and everything else so we can really do a
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.000]   lot
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.120]   And so that's you know the DC facility was already always kind of
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.800]   Built to do that and it was kind of the backbone for a lot of our shows and we decided to go ahead and put a studio on the front end
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   And so so it's it's kind of fun
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.400]   I thought I thought you're a joke in a Renee. He actually does offer 8k 360 streaming
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.000]   Of course
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   16ks not practically yet
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.720]   It's like if someone in the control control function for that is like the highest resolution picture
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   I've ever have taken of me Wow
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.440]   Unbelievable and look at the depth of field on Alex - I know what kind of cameras you
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.200]   Up there these are black magic miniruses. Oh, I love those. Yeah with 4k glass and so they you know
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   We one of the things we didn't want to do is have
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.040]   I mean broadcast is all two-thirds inch by doubling that
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.680]   That size it shortens it up the field a lot makes the set look bigger and and so the talk about the sensor
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.880]   I sir. Yeah, the sensor size super 35 sensors
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.040]   So it's about a little like to 2.2 times bigger than a traditional broadcast sensor so it
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.320]   We think it looks nice. I'm glad to see you I saw you stuck with a high LPR 40 microphones
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.920]   Just for you Leo
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.880]   You break these out for Mac break weekly and then you get the good microphones for the other stuff is that it?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.840]   No, no, we we we do that with it's the you could choose
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.240]   You get to choose for podcasting for podcasting or anything that's going to be audio
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.800]   Primary, right then we use these and then if we're doing video primary then you end up using labs
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.000]   You know last thing but we I have had some experience and I know that you hate
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.600]   Labs, so not crazy about it
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.400]   But but if you're right if people are focused on the video they don't hear how but you know
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.080]   I didn't notice it until I was listening to one of the Sunday shows face the nation or meet the press as a podcast and
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.180]   The audio was terrible and you never noticed it on television
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.360]   But but as soon as you're hearing the audio only it's echo. It's it's television audio
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.040]   So yeah, it really is and you just don't you don't think about it because that's the way they all sound right
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.000]   But it's yeah, but it's so but so we have both options
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.160]   So well and I wonder if that maybe has changed like infomercials where they fake being a late night out like an interview show
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.780]   But it's actually promoting pills. Yeah. Yeah, vitamins. Are you guys selling vitamins?
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:32.440]   Hey before we go to that great by before we go to the vitamin's ads I
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.080]   Want to ask Renee Richie if you survived last week as we were signing off last week Apple was announcing
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.600]   Yet another record quarter
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.160]   Yeah, I mean so
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.080]   There every quarter of this doubt Leo and I understand it
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.600]   It's like being at a table in Vegas and the guy next to you rolls and wins and you're like okay
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.040]   He won he's probably gonna lose the next time and he wins again and you're like ah
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.000]   Okay for sure is when he wins and then he wins and then he wins and you're like he's got to lose and every time they win again
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.160]   You're like it's got to lose it's got to lose is just it's gambler's law
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.600]   You got to lose and once in a while they've had hiccups
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.720]   But over but you know repeatedly over and over again
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.360]   They managed to ride primarily the iPhone the iPhone goldmine into record shattering after record shattering quarters and
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   It was a tough compare for Mac and iPad because last year Apple released all the new Macs at WwDC and the new iPad pros
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.520]   WwDC and this year they did not
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.720]   So there was no compare for those and the numbers but for iPhone it's it's still doing well
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.500]   And for iPhone it's the best quarter
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:39.080]   You know the best results since iPhone though hey day the heady days of iPhone 6
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.360]   These are the great color graphs that six colors does Jason Snell does
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:51.800]   This is year over year revenue change in an iPhone and the that big hump on the left is of course iPhone 6 era
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.640]   Which is 2015 but 20% growth year over year in iPhone
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.040]   Revenue this year this quarter that's that's that's you got to attribute that to the iPhone 10
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.600]   Well the iPhone 6 sort of sucked a lot of upgradeers up early because there was a lot of pent up same way like when the iPhone went to Verizon
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.880]   There was a lot of pent up demand for a bigger iPhone
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.480]   So people rushed to get it and that cost them upgrades and cost themselves later on yet to pay those are paid forward essentially
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.980]   And now with iPhone 10 their asp it's not so much that people are buying more of them
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.480]   But Apple increased the price and didn't lose enough customers to lose money
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.060]   They actually made money so you know that's that's sort of what you want to do in business
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.680]   Look at this graph the average iPhone selling price highest
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.760]   It's ever been 717 dollars and cook comment on that
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.200]   He said it's not about the price of the iPhone
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   It's about the value of the iPhone can deliver and if people believe the iPhone is delivering value then they're less price sensitive
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:50.000]   And we have to remember that almost nobody plays sticker price even now when the contracts are gone a lot of people pay their carrier
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.920]   Instead of eight bucks a month they pay him nine or ten bucks a month and it's almost invisible to them
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   You know that's one take on it
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.200]   Tim's take it's it's all about value the other take is
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.360]   Hey, it's a fashion statement and people who are buying at the high end of the market like that are less price sensitive
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   I
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.680]   Mean I think it'd be hard you'd be hard pressed to say that there is that much more value in an iPhone 10
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.160]   Then there is in a $600 Android you got the new design that was the big thing
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.680]   It's same like you got the bigger iPhone before now you got the bet that you got to delete your bezels a year earlier by
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.880]   Pointing up another hundred dollars. Yeah, and now the interesting thing is how many companies are rushing super high end phones to the market
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.000]   But nobody's really very few people would put value and Apple in the same sense, right?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.160]   They're not a value company. They're premium light. No, it's a it's a
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.960]   Yeah, totally
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.200]   So like if you because when you buy that iPhone again, it comes with Apple care comes with Apple stores
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.240]   It comes with all the things that all the free software that they provide for that platform
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.520]   If you like the app store and the way they vet apps on the app store it comes with that
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.760]   Overall you still have to like people aren't gonna just
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:03.000]   Yeah, well, it's funny because I was thinking of getting another electric vehicle besides a Tesla
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.320]   And then I realized after we drove to Tahoe this past week that the value of the Tesla is not the car
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.160]   So supercharger network, right? Well, and also they cool the batteries which a lot of cars don't and you have to replace your batteries after a couple
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.320]   It's again. It's the whole package the whole package, right?
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.160]   So you could never say that Tesla is a value car a value priced car
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.000]   Yeah, go ahead Andy. I'm sorry. I keep cutting you out
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.880]   I'm just gonna say that with a with the iPhone 10 I think Apple has
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.760]   Reminded everybody that when you get the top of the line iPhone it really isn't just it really doesn't compete with a
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.080]   $600
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.880]   Android phone even even like a Google Pixel which is one of the best phones out there whether it runs iOS or Android
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.120]   You're all you're gonna get something that is absolutely unique to
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.440]   Mobile computing like face ID. I really think that the iPhone 10 is just the story about face ID
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.320]   It's such a compelling cool feature that for people that are already
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.800]   Extra hundred fifty two hundred dollars that's still money to anybody
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.480]   But if you're already in for eight hundred that is a compelling thing to get a thousand bucks for
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.600]   Particularly if you're in the habit of always buying the best iPhone on the market
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   So when I say it depends on your definition of value
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.640]   The idea of getting a five hundred dollar Android phone or even a two hundred fifty dollar Android phone
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:24.160]   That does 80% of even the best phones on the market. That's value. That's saving money, but there's a certain
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.960]   actual sort of limbic
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.520]   appeal
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.960]   To getting an iPhone 10 that for a lot of people is gonna be definitely worth the extra hundred fifty bucks
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.440]   Amark to eyes over to our just don't get that kind of experience
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:43.800]   I just feel that the notch really justifies that extra 300. Well, it's the not surely. Yeah, it's actually it
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.960]   It's really the the the mimeo G
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   You know like actually
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.440]   You might actually be right
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.360]   Like emojis not till this fall, but okay, you might be right that those little
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.640]   Those little things are the anemojis
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.440]   You know that the issue is is like like I I send me mojis and anemojis to my kids
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.360]   And then they want to send them back and they're like oh your mom only has it yeah
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.960]   I'm sorry. You can't you have to have an iPhone 10
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.760]   I'm sorry
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.440]   This is not traditionally a big iPhone quarter though, right? This is or is it I try it's not I mean
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.040]   It's not as bad as the next quarter is well everyone's waiting for the new phone
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.720]   But it's the first like the holiday quarter is this the first full quarter since it came out
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.800]   No, that's usually the holiday. It's not even that okay. Yeah. Yeah, this is this is when people start wine
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   I mean it's like I would never you see people go into stores and buy like an iPhone 10 the day before iPhone 11 comes out
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.400]   So I can't predict human behavior any better than anybody else
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.160]   But the pixel 3 is supposed to have an even bigger notch now Leo
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   So I don't know if that's gonna be even more expensive
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.800]   I know now I have to decide
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.560]   It we should point out this average iPhone selling price of
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   $1770 is based on the average over four quarters
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.000]   So there's a kind of a ballistic effect the iPhone came out in Q1
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.880]   But it's contributed to the the larger price in in Q3 because it's now three out of the four quarters
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   Yeah, it's a running average
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.000]   Some bad news if you're an iPad fan iPad sales are absolutely flat in the last four quarters
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.440]   Again, it's a it's a terrible compare for them because they had just put out new iPads at you know in June of
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:33.160]   2017 and they did not put out anything new in 2018 so nobody bought anything everyone's anticipating the fall release
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.600]   11 million units it's I mean it's not terrible and again. This is a four quarter average. He does those running averages
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.720]   Max sales year over year down 13%
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.760]   Another down quarter third in a row and the largest
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.480]   I don't believe any MacBook Pros
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.120]   I think the MacBook Pro came out too late to be included in that quarter
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.280]   So again, you're competing against a quarter where there was every like the MacBook Pro MacBook
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.680]   Even the thing the MacBook Air got a token bump and the iMacs were all updated in June and this year
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:07.840]   Only the MacBook Pro and on too late for that quarter and I imagine why the the MacBook Pro one of the things that tribute to a better quarter next
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.000]   Time yeah, go ahead. Yeah, and I think I think one of the things when we look at the flat iPad and in the Mac
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.440]   Low rain is that is that there aren't as many apps that drive these computers?
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.040]   There's not as many features that we look at oh my I have to have that, you know, I need to
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.360]   Yeah, it's not gonna run fast enough
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.440]   Yeah, I knew it because like I my kids are using iPad 2s
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.240]   You know and they're quite happy with them
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.120]   They play their Roblox goes as fast as it goes on their 13 inch
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.880]   You know and and so the problem is is that they they they because you can seamlessly go back and forth between these different
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.160]   You know pieces it doesn't you don't feel the need to upgrade every that's the big thing that we've gotten to this crazy turn
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.520]   Where we're buying a new phone every year?
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.920]   We just didn't do that before you know and so you know and and we used to I kept my my trio
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.160]   I had for three or four years, you know and and so those are the kinds of things that have that's why the phone explodes
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.560]   And then the computers I mean I'm using a 2015 that I'm still happy with although I played
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.440]   I played with a new one, you know, it's all I have to upgrade but anyway, but you know, so it is faster
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.460]   But with the iPads all my stuff works great, you know
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.640]   I'm not on a necessary version one but the last couple versions and so I don't feel the need to upgrade either
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.800]   Yeah, and also
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:26.360]   You have to really put a lot of blame I think at Apple's feet that it is true that we haven't had really significant updates to
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   to the Mac book line within those quarters, but that's kind of been true for the past couple years with Mac and
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:39.200]   So we can't see it on the one hand you can say that okay. Well usually a lot of these numbers get spiked
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   Spiked upwards by exciting new designs, but Apple also should be taking a task for really not showing any public enthusiasm
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.760]   For the Mac for the past couple of years and for the iPad stuff
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.440]   It's it's it's it's gonna it's interesting to look at the numbers
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:02.740]   Because it seems as though Apple has really this a polarize the the the awesomeness of their devices in terms of
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.240]   Price that one of the best computers. I think Apple has ever made is the
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.320]   $320 iPad but also one of the other one of the other best computers have ever made is the
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.160]   $1000 iPad Pro so there's not like there's a spectrum. It's like if you get people excited about
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:25.280]   adding quantities of the lower Kate lower and iPad now suddenly every iPad sold is making six hundred dollars less
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.220]   Thank you for being that much less to to the to the till with it with every purchase
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:39.900]   How let's see maybe there's one more graph before we oh no
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.220]   I know what I wanted to quote Jason Snow
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:49.540]   He said the Mac has currently replaced iPad is the product line that makes me cringe every three months when sales figures are released
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.580]   But I again, I think they'll be good news next quarter. I hope they'll be good news next quarter and I hope Apple
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.620]   I'm still thinking Apple
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.820]   Keeps the Mac alive for more than just profit. It's it's sentimental reasons
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:09.380]   It's a it's a signature product and developers need to develop on the Mac for iOS
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.580]   So I think that they're gonna keep doing pros and I think Neil cyber keeps saying that you know
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.900]   Apple should just I'm please forgive me if I miss quoting any ill but you know that if you were just looking at the numbers Apple
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.740]   Should divest itself absolutely theater business because absolutely Google doesn't have that problem and they can race ahead and Microsoft
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.220]   No doesn't have the new business. So that's fine
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.660]   But they should dive in just go in on it
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.420]   But when you look at what Apple's doing like they're investing significance to look in resources and things like T2
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.820]   Which you know, they they don't have to do their max were perfectly functional without T2
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:45.860]   But that's a big investment in something that Apple considers a core competency and they're putting a lot of work into not just releasing new versions of Mac OS
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.340]   But really redoing Mac OS from the foundation of rewriting the windowing server, which has been problematic like discovery D
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.540]   It was problematic, but they're rewriting launch D and they're rewriting
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.780]   They're doing APFS and they're built they're basically rebuilding
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:04.700]   Mac OS from the inside and that's again considerable resources and I don't think they would be expending all that stuff internally
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.140]   They could put those things on iPhone
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.180]   But they doing it because they believe the Mac is a valuable product for them to have yep, I agree still
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.540]   I think that if your consumer Mac user you better
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.700]   You better have an exit strategy just in case Apple decides that
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.180]   Consumers are best diverted towards other Apple platforms and Macs
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:30.060]   Maybe are going to be reserved for people who are who need pro level devices
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:36.700]   I think not that I not that I have any special knowledge or I even necessarily believe that Apple's gonna be dumping consumer Macs
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.100]   But they've really shown no enthusiasm whatsoever
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:47.300]   For the low end of the middle range of performance and price so until they once again show that here is a Mac mini
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.060]   It was we've not just we've not just swapped in a
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:57.060]   Processor that is now less expensive for us to put in than the lower speed processor that was there for the previous two years
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.500]   But we have actually moved it forward. We've moved the fab forward
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:07.940]   We have added new features to it that are going to be completely relevant to how people are going to use like a heightable desktop computer
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:13.860]   Until I see that kind of excitement. I'm not going to put a whole lot of money on the idea of the Mac
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.380]   As a consumer device still existing in five years
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.020]   Meanwhile the Apple watch hit an air pocket
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:29.740]   Well, I think Tim doesn't fly commercial. I think that's what that's a good thing if you're scuba diving and you're out of air
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:36.820]   It's a bad thing if you're flying he meant an updraft right he meant an air pocket is the way you fall and updraft is where you go up
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.020]   But anyway
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.020]   He did say record quarter
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.780]   Performance June quarter performance with growth in the mid
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.220]   40% range
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.620]   He remember he said 50% growth
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:56.500]   For the last few quarters, so it's not maybe slowing a little bit but still growing very strong Apple watch again. We have no
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:04.500]   It's pesos numbers. I like it. That's exactly that's exactly what Jason puts on this graph. He says
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:10.180]   So he's trying to give you a graph of Apple watch sales, which he can't do so he says source
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.700]   Baze a scale Bezos source stuff tip Tim Cook says sometimes
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:23.860]   He's just basically made a graph with Tim Cook quotes great best yet record up 50% from last year 50% unit growth
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:30.500]   With a third straight quarter 50% revenue growth in a Q2 record hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole new level
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.740]   Whatever that is and nice nice guessing Jason on the bar graph
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.260]   As exemplary work. I like the peso scale. We may be using that more often
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:53.300]   Let's see services we knew this would be the case I even asked you to pay attention to that Renee and I I gather that this was a very good
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:59.860]   Quarter once again nine point five billion dollars up from nine point two last quarter
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.940]   And it's finally a story that wall street seems to appreciate
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:11.540]   Oh, yeah, do we mention apple at a trillion dollar market? Yeah, do we mention that? I mean, it's a vanity metric
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.500]   But what a big number well, you know that it really is
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.940]   For a little reality check there as well
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:25.300]   Is it's a vanity number especially given the fact that it wouldn't be anywhere near that if they weren't spending hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.820]   Buying their own stock back. I mean, there's a little bit of a you know that that's stock the stock when we really talk about stock
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.700]   I mean the gap was doing great. They're gonna keep on making more money. That's great
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.580]   But that that is not what's giving them a trillion dollar valuation
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.220]   What's giving them a trillion dollar valuation is is basically taking a otherwise stagnant stock
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:47.060]   And you know and basically inflating it by buying their own and keeping the investors happy
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.020]   Otherwise people wouldn't move on. I'm also I'm also impressed that they've managed to become a trillion dollar company
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.020]   Without amassing a whole bunch of really terrible scandals like
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.020]   I have so much respect for so many things that amazon has a
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.140]   achieved
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.340]   But I do not like the fact that every single conversation about
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:09.940]   About the amazon that consists of more than four sentences has to consist has to include the phrase
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:15.460]   But they treat their lowest paid workers like crap that facebook is a very successful company
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.100]   but they are
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.100]   essentially a beehive
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.900]   full
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:28.020]   Of horrible ideas implemented carelessly with thought to how best to protect its users from the community
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:35.540]   That it's own that's someone service have created whereas apple all you basically get are a couple of really intense attention getting
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.580]   Oh, well, they're recycling a certain element from their phone frames
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.580]   But they could be recycling more or yes, they're paying their workers
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.380]   In their subcontractors in china very very well and treating them very very well
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.300]   Compared to other manufacturers, but maybe they could be treating them well
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:59.620]   So the fact that they I you always take things tongue-in-cheek when you have a company that likes to position itself as oh, well
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:04.180]   We are a very ethical company and we are a very green company and we are very very positive
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.380]   And we we have values that we feel are very very positive
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.340]   But apple tends to actually deliver on that stuff too
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.580]   So that has to be mentioned and I think that one of the things when we when we look at those sock buybacks
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.060]   The only thing I was going to say is that I think that
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.700]   One of the things we see here is the schism between apples
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.660]   Personality I think and how much money they're making they're actually making money
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.220]   They're focused like a startup
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.780]   And and they're making money
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:35.540]   Like a you know like the biggest company in the world and the problem is they literally don't have a culture of
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.460]   Well, we could just experiment with a bunch of things
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.380]   We could take that hundred billion dollars and we could buy T-Mobile and create a sell not working by
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.940]   Something else and do this, you know, they don't want to be distracted and they they they have something that works
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.340]   I think that someday down the road we may say well that might have been a good idea
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.300]   You know to to get distracted and do and move into other businesses
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.620]   So far they've been able to leverage this really well, but it does create a
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.100]   a pretty
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.900]   You know like the very top heavy situation where if the iPhone collapsed for for some reason
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.340]   You know apple would still make billions
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.140]   But not not in the same, you know, not in the same way
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.860]   Actually when you talk about stock buybacks, it reminds me that elan musk this morning
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.300]   Dropped a bombshell on twitter not the first time elan's done this
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:29.620]   Uh this morning a couple hours ago. I'm considering taking tesla private at four hundred twenty dollars
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:34.340]   That's per share funding secured and then he tweets good morning
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.460]   My but he's yeah
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.660]   Unfortunately, he's almost becoming like the what donald trump is to high-level politics
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:49.140]   What I know I know because he says these things and you don't know whether you can
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.180]   Dismiss them because maybe he
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:59.460]   He had a bad fig in his breakfast or something or this is just a passing thought that he's not really going to commit to
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.860]   Uh didn't the stock like just
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.700]   Or maybe he was just they've actually the market's taken seriously the stocks suspended training
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.860]   so
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.020]   Whatever whatever he's meant. He's certainly had the if it had an effect
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:20.980]   There's no doubt about that. I love the we were showing the times infographic from last thursday on what one trillion dollars
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:28.340]   Is it it's apple is worth way more than all the major automakers in the world
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.100]   apple is worth war than the entire media industry
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:41.380]   The american media industry if you put netflix comcast disney all the major news publishers and all the tv channels
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:46.020]   It would still be eight hundred forty eight billion less than the trillion that apple
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:52.900]   Uh is worse. Thank you. That's a lot of money. It's it seems it seems like every single time there's either an article
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.260]   There's never been a really cool like animated infographic like that
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.100]   But they all like remind me of the same scot tv sketch
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:06.180]   Where it's like a russian russian broadcaster with a big big map of the uss are behind him
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:12.340]   I'm saying, uh, look how look how puny the now i'm going to take this the the country rastrelia massive continent
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:18.100]   Yes, uh, look how tiny it is when we put it inside the borders of russia now. Let's add
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.020]   Add it's like, okay, that's fine. I mean, but uh, I
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.100]   It's the the fact that it's trying to our company
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.220]   It doesn't help that keyboard anymore any doesn't and it doesn't solve the dongle problem
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.620]   No, and in fact we say that every time we talk about
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.980]   As we have the last 20 minutes stuck pricing and and uh quarterly results
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:46.740]   It's only a small indicator in what we care about which is do you want to you know how you use your mac how to use your ipad?
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:53.060]   What do you want a different game? It's a different game in time and it and it's it's the the only thing that's really important to apple
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.220]   And to all the companies in silicon valley is that it is about employee retention
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:03.460]   So they have you know, this is the golden hand cuff that keeps all of these employees if those if that stock stops going up
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:08.820]   They start deciding they can leave and they can move on but every time they have another quarter where they're going to get another
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.900]   Uh a couple hundred shares of stock that are going to be worth thousands of dollars
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.820]   They go maybe i'll wait a little bit longer and for you know right now
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:22.180]   Everything is so competitive when it comes to engineering when it comes to product management when it comes to all the things that they need
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.860]   There's if you're if you've worked at apple you could work anywhere, you know to you know and get it get a job quickly
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.980]   And so they part of the reason they're doing the buybacks part of the reason they're making sure that their stock goes up
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.420]   And part of the reason it has to keep moving up is because they'll start losing their employees
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.540]   That's the case for you know, that's the challenge right now for facebook if it doesn't
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.300]   Turn this around uh, it could lose a lot of its best people
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.580]   in
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.700]   In in a couple quarters. You're talking about the highest highest highest not not necessarily the best engineers
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.300]   But we're talking about the executives that when you need to bring somebody on to bring to run your movie
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   New your new movie company you need to
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:03.220]   Uh, you need to convince them to walk away from 12 years in the actual movie business at which they are now making
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.260]   Enough money that it doesn't even matter. Uh, what you do with it anymore. So if you were going to
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.460]   Attempting to apple you're not only gonna give them new ideas
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.940]   But you're also gonna have to say we're gonna give you so much money that we don't need to come up with a new
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.540]   Where to replace avarice and but because this will be and I would say upper middle
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.460]   You know because a middle and upper middle because the thing is is there's a lot of people that are
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.860]   You know making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year not millions, but hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:33.380]   But they're getting these little stock hits. I think there's a huge competition among engineers in silicon valley and it's
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:39.460]   Absolutely and it's apple and it's google and you're in the stock price is a big deal for if you're you know
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:44.500]   A good engine because a lot of folks are getting their salary is one number and then their stock is another and they know
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:52.740]   But you know, let's point out that a high stock price does not necessarily a good thing and engineers looking for something that's going to be high
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.620]   That they usually get them at a discount, right?
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.620]   Like they get you know, you want what you're looking at is future prospects
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.780]   Same thing the market's looking at is future prospects not what their price is today
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.180]   Which is why which is why you need to keep on moving that stock up and do whatever you have to do to do that
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.460]   So if you have a stagnant the problem is this is this there is a this is a this is a train that you're not allowed to get off
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.780]   As a company, yeah, exactly right
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.340]   Yeah, the challenge when you get into this when you start giving away stock is that you have to keep you know
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:26.340]   edging up in fact big growth quarters of growing 30 percent a year or 40 percent a year makes that game
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:32.260]   Harder and harder harder apples actually better off growing 10 or 15 percent a year or 20 percent a year
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.100]   And not having anything bigger than that. Yeah from the point of view of talking about the
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.500]   Yeah, yeah, right well
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:45.140]   But and I think that I think that the stock value to apple that is the value like you know like that the stock is to apple
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:45.780]   I agree
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.260]   Yeah, they don't get more money because they're because their stocks prices higher all they care about as their employees
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:55.860]   All they care about is employer retention and the entire stock value and pumping it up and making sure that it keeps moving forward
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:01.460]   Is all about keeping employees if you think if they didn't do the buyback you think it'd be as high as it is
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:07.780]   No, I think it'd be the valuation would be between one and two hundred billion a buyback benefits
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.820]   Shareholders because it reduces the number of shares
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.940]   So in effect, it's increasing the value of that one share you whole right because they're not buying a back
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.260]   Apple's not buying them back and then keeping the stock so they're not trying to buy the company back
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:27.220]   They are increasing the value of every of every share single share which benefits so it's it really is it's purely a
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.660]   Another version of a dividend right right
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.900]   Can I just see that on on this set with these cameras and these lights?
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.580]   I feel as those completely inappropriate. I think they're appropriate to be talking about
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.460]   Well, I'm very very bullish on apple this water. It does like a little like cnbc
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:52.900]   In squawk box today and you're not co we go to mccow Alex lindsey and from mccow
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.660]   Renee rich
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.460]   Bum bum. You know, do you karsti you wouldn't happen to have a fire starter on you, would you?
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:05.540]   You do do you have a knife in a bottle opener too? I do and it's where is it?
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.660]   Where do you where are you keeping that? I thought you probably shouldn't bring a knife in the studio
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.060]   I've got it. Uh very close to me. It's in your belt buckle
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:22.100]   He's wearing the fabulous. This is my favorite slide belt, but we're going to show some more
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:28.660]   This is the what do you call this utility belt? This is survival. Yeah, this isn't useful. This is survival
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.820]   Look at this thing. This looks like a regular belt buckle by the way the the rest of the belts in the box too
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:38.420]   I just shown you the belt buckle the slide belt is an amazing ratchet based belt that you're going to love
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.580]   but in in his belt buckle karstin has
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.860]   Let me open it. Oh, this is by the way to protect you
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.620]   You cannot get the knife out unless you open that side there. All right
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.700]   That's by the way very sharp notice it also has a bottle opener
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.740]   And then over here. Hey, somebody stole my light
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.700]   So
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.340]   You know what get Jason howl in here. He took the light out of my uh survival belt
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.220]   This is one of a number of great belts actually we're all
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.020]   That's all right. You karstin. You don't have to give me your light
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.540]   Did you steal it out of here karstin?
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.060]   What if you need to start a fire?
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.300]   This is uh you can use this as a fire starter
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.020]   As well as a very tiny but very useful and as you can see very bright
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.340]   LED flashlight
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.180]   Your belt buckle now my son's saying you know what we should do a little slide belt fashion show
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.500]   I'm wearing I don't know how well you could see this
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.860]   Let's see in this out of the way here. I'm wearing my fabulous twill slide belt. Now. Let me show you what's great about the slide
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.060]   Bell. It's a ratchet design. Okay, so when I slide it off
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:43.460]   I'll open it up so you can see it these ratchets mean that when I put it on
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:49.620]   It's kind of almost infinitely adjustable, which is great because sometimes I eat a big meal
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.540]   And I would take out a notch or two sometimes
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.900]   I I'm feeling extremely thin. Look at that twit. Isn't that nice and I'll just slide it in there
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.940]   I love that sound the slide belt makes slide belts
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   Uh are available at slide belts.com/twit. There's the survival belt in a variety of flavors from full grain and top grain leathers
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:15.540]   To high quality canvas and animal friendly vegan. We thought we do a little you want a little fashion show
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.820]   Come here. Hank. My son is here. Can Hank be in this?
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:25.460]   Hank's here. Hank is wearing the black on black, which I really like the canvas is that leather canvas
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.580]   Top grain leather and the black belt show that they're Hank. Isn't that nice?
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.140]   Hank's pants never fall down
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.620]   He's wearing that beautiful slide belt
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.780]   Also from the slide belt for Brian come up here and and and hiring
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.060]   And a netty are from slide belt netty. Where are you wearing there?
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.820]   He's too cool to show his slide belt. Look at that. There's the canvas. That's very nice
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.700]   Yep, and I see Brian's got the leather
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:59.540]   These guys are cool. They're hip. They're happening and should they have a large meal, which we're going to feed them momentarily
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   They can just let it out a notch
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:09.220]   I love my slide belt. You will too high quality comfortable ratchet belts that are easy to adjust
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.300]   Uh and so you know, I just have to say so much more comfortable
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.420]   Because with the old fashioned belt with the holes
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.740]   You know, it never fits quite it's either just a little too loose or just a little too tight
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:28.980]   The patented ratchet design adjusted precisely to you with 32 uh separate adjustments, which makes it super comfortable
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.660]   Here's the canvas uh slide belt. So what you do. Oh, I like this antique brass buckle. This is pretty
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.220]   So what you do when you get the belt
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:41.700]   You'll see that inside the belt they have markings for a variety of sizes
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.340]   So so you cut it to the size you want it could be a little little generous
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.980]   You might you know, you might add an inch or two down the road
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:56.660]   Then you put the end in here and it locks it in you can later unlock it and uh and and adjust the belt to your desire
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.940]   But the ratchet is so awesome. Let me show you this other side
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.860]   It goes in
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.820]   And and and it's got the ratchet on there and just slides in and ratchets right up like that
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:12.420]   Is such an improvement to the traditional belt because you can remove the buckle you can mix and match with other straps
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.980]   Honestly, that's really cool. Right
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:20.660]   Uh, you you can uh, you've got all sorts of customization and versatility. I love this
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.180]   Uh, this is you know what i'm gonna. I'm taking this one home
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.140]   That's it you can
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:34.420]   I'm gonna. I like this brass buckle. This is beautiful. This is uh, this is uh, this is a nice canvas animal friendly vegan
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:40.580]   Uh, you can wear them casually around the house. You know, this would be good casual belt or then get out the top grain leather
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:44.900]   You know for a special special occasion special date
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:53.380]   If you're not convinced full one year warranty and free exchanges and no hassle returns. Oh, look at that plan
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.460]   I like that the red plaid that's nice
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.620]   That's fun
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.900]   Here's what you do if you're ready for a better belt and I know you are
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.620]   Do they have them for women too, right? Yeah, men or women this would be a great gift
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.700]   I think a great groomsman gift for the monogram one, you know
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.140]   You could put the date of the wedding or the initials of the bride and groom

[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.140]   I think this would be a really good gift for the groomsmen, right the survival belt

[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.580]   Because I could never get a belt that was comfortable
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.820]   No more suspenders. I got this legit ordering so many of these Leo
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.740]   You know
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:38.740]   Maybe it's just me but as we as we get sometimes a little heftier. It's nice to have a belt
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.340]   You have a big meal
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.340]   Henry likes those uh tomahawk
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:47.540]   Stakes you got a couple of those and you'll be glad you got a slide belt. That's all I'm saying
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.340]   Your belt turns your pants into sweatpants. You don't need to wear actuals
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.860]   It's actually life and and there's another side effect to it. You actually look a little sharper
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.780]   You know, you don't want your belt to be so tight that your belly's hanging out
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.860]   But you don't want it to be so loose that your pants are falling down
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:09.940]   It's great. You have the flexibility to get it just right every time the fit is perfect slidebelts.com/twit
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.300]   Use the code twitted check out and you're gonna get 20 off
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.860]   um
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.260]   Moving right along. Do we do everything in the quarter with any other notes Renee from the
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.780]   I mean the only one that was interesting to me was that when Tim Cook said that anecdotally they're starting to see
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:32.580]   um people who want an apple watch and are then buying an iPhone to get apple watch and that sort of hints to the ecosystem play
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.460]   We talked about earlier where it's not just the phone
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:41.860]   But it's the sum of the phone and maybe you really want the apple watch or maybe you really want the apple tv or you really want apple music or
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:47.300]   Some other service and all of that is what gets you to buy it to make that decision to buy into apple
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.220]   And they're getting much much better at getting people to buy in bigger and bigger
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.420]   Well, it's exactly as you're saying it's an ecosystem of services
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:01.940]   And the value comes from not just one thing but the but the products as a whole but we've always said that that's what apple's been going for that lock in
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.820]   Right and you have that social system too. I mean you get
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.220]   As an iPhone user every time you get a
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.580]   Oh, I know
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.860]   peer pressure, baby
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:15.300]   You know like there's there's a thousand things I can't do now like I and I won't get any of your updates on my computer and I won't
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.860]   you know like it's like
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:24.820]   It's not even like there is technical lock-in, but there's also sort of an emotional lock-in. That's a positive thing
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:30.100]   I was on the train yesterday coming home from boston and
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.660]   There was a a gaggle of lovely like older ladies
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.940]   That if there was a actually gaggle of four
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:45.620]   Hooked up with a another gaggle of three doing something that only women can do that I envy that one of them just
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.220]   To the other I like I like your I like your nail polish. Oh, yeah
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.060]   And then suddenly it's a gaggle of seven. Anyway, what I'm saying is that they're all talking about apple
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.620]   Oh, yeah, I like your nail polish and I think it's gorgeous. I could say that you know
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.180]   I went I went with something different
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.580]   Uh, new so I got to be patriotic
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.580]   I like that
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.060]   But yeah people people are comfortable buying more apple products because in general
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:17.940]   Again, unless they haven't bought a four thousand dollar mac book with a terrible keyboard every time they've bought a mac
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.020]   An apple product has worked out very well for them
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.260]   So the next time that there is an opportunity to buy something mac like a smart speaker
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.020]   They're really really interested in taking that step or an apple tv
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:32.180]   It doesn't necessarily have to be the leader in the market. It's an apple product
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.900]   It's not just being a fanboy or a fan girl
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:41.140]   It really is that I've had such a good track record with this company that I'm willing to simply say I really want a streaming box
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   I'm just gonna buy the apple one last week
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:48.180]   Alex Lindsey said I'd buy an apple car sight unseen. Oh, yeah
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:54.820]   I think I've said that for years. I mean and I think that apple has a certain number of us that we'll just go
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.820]   Well, they're coming out with something that would fit perfectly into you know what i'm doing
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:03.380]   um, you know, I think that uh, I think there's you know millions of people that wouldn't buy
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.580]   Um
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.460]   Car from apple if apple said again if apple with the phone they don't have to I mean
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.220]   It's useful for them to do the launch event
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.300]   But I still think just for them to prove the the situation if they just said
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.140]   Order everything the friday before we actually do the launch event
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.940]   You know, then you're a first in line. They would all those people that buy right afterwards
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.500]   Uh, you know that they would all do it immediately. There we go
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.980]   You kind of did that used to do that you travis your friend down at the apple store in san francisco
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:35.700]   You call on and say whatever they're announcing. I want three of them. Yeah. Yeah, just just
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.100]   I don't I don't know if apple's in that same
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.940]   Exalted stat status. No, I'm not i'm not saying they could sell all of their their phones that way
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.900]   But I bet you they could sell, you know, tens of millions of phones on the friday
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.900]   It's before the launch event
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.900]   I think people knew that they were gonna get ahead if I knew that I was gonna get ahead of everybody else in line
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.380]   And I know that I want it sight unseen. I think that i'm gonna put my figure to the win
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.780]   But I think it's changed
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.900]   Because I do I honestly believe that the
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:14.500]   Partly because these phones are so expensive now. It is no longer an automatic. Um two years. It's time for my new iphone
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.740]   I see you get a free now. Don't you from a lot of carriers when you're every year. I see more and more people say
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.380]   I'm happy with my phone six or six s I can't i'm too expensive. I'm not gonna buy it
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.980]   True. Don't use like computers when you can do email right
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:33.220]   You're not going to sell the 65 million without the the presentation in that quarter, but but selling the
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.820]   The first 10, you know, I think that they might they might
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:46.100]   What if they did so what if they did sort of like a version of project red where like a charity sort of thing that said
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.100]   sight unseen we actually we have the first 100 right here
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.140]   Well, I would say in our offices for a
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:43:00.100]   $1,000 over the list price which will go to this charity what would make more money is if they said here's the deal sight unseen
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.860]   Buy you're gonna buy it. It's gonna be the best one that we make it's not gonna be any you know
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.340]   It's going to be the top the top of the line one. It's gonna cost $25 more
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:15.220]   They would generate 25 million to 50 million dollars for some charity by saying, you know
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.580]   Just just buy it ahead of time and not your your benefiting charity and you're benefiting
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:23.220]   You know literally $25 more on your eye was gonna go to it sight you buy sight unseen
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:28.820]   You know apple could do that tomorrow and and people would but but how much earlier would they have to do this
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.700]   So there would actually be sight unseen but by the time you're like a week a week or two weeks in advance
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.900]   Already we've gotten like we cut we feel as though we know what the new phones are gonna be
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.620]   Like but we don't know
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.820]   The same is that is that you're as as for me
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.700]   I would love to not have quite the same crowd so I don't have to wait three weeks for my phone like
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:54.820]   As a true believer. Oh, jeez. And I will say that I am you're in a thin on the phone thin
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:01.780]   I sing on the cake. You're not I would say I would say that's that's but that that thin I bet you is 10 million
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.700]   That's a lot of money. Yeah, I know I agree
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:04.420]   It's no
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   It's 10 million thick and the thing is is that is that what we would love to do at you know
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.660]   When apple gets into that whole culture of you know
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.860]   You know a strength in the core of those people feeling like you get in front of a line because you're not waiting for them
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.580]   To tell you what it is and a lot of people that would do that
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.220]   I'm not saying everybody because they sell hundreds of millions of phones. I'm just saying there's 10 million
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.420]   Um, you know 10 or 15 million that that would probably just go
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.780]   I'm gonna buy it because now I don't have to wait for three weeks and and that and and folks who want to buy it ahead of time
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.820]   Shouldn't have to wait you need an apple bespoke edition or the apple
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:42.020]   The apple premier club your edition. Yeah, I mean no, I think that first
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:46.980]   But there's already the apple like the subscription program where you just get a new iflon every year you give back your old one
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.980]   You get any one and that both people are automatically getting
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.900]   I've been thinking I really ought to do that because I'm going to get the new iphone every year
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.220]   Is it the same price?
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.540]   Yeah, it's the same price is basically a zero a zero dollar lease and every year you get a new
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:07.140]   Part because I know I mean i'm gonna get the new iphone every year. So yeah, and I wonder you wonder whether that's that's where all this is really
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:11.300]   I mean when we see the drivers of yeah constant growth
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.980]   So microsubstone with windows and office is uh subscription basically
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:19.620]   iPhone as a service. Yeah as a service. You know who's really happy about uh
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.580]   trillion dollars. I I didn't realize this uh
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.580]   Warren buffet
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.780]   His oh, yeah, his stake in apple is now worth 50
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.780]   Is this right? I can't be reading this right 50 billion dollars
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.340]   50 billion he bought more apple in january
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:42.900]   I don't know what he spent for his 50 billion, but that's phenomenal. He doesn't lose a lot of money
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:49.380]   Uh and the thing is is for him you buy that much of stock and because you're buying it it increases
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.780]   He he probably made oh, yeah when he announced that he was sure and he probably made five billion dollars out of it
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.740]   So his initial investment was 10 million shares
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.620]   For 1.1 billion
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:07.140]   He has bought more since so I it's like 711 money for him. Yeah, well I get billion here billion there
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.380]   It's worth 50 billion now
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.220]   He's so talking about services. I do notice more and more apple
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:17.940]   I'd be mentioned this last week and more and more apple pay terminals. I'm using the apple watch a lot more
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:23.060]   There's just something there's this hump that you get over and now I use it. I used to use it the other thing I love
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:27.860]   And especially because I have the new the the fingerprint reader on the new
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:33.380]   MacBook pro and remember I eschewed the touch bar for the last two years
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.500]   Is I can pie stuff expensive stuff
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.820]   like just by just by touching the fingerprint reader
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:46.660]   I love that you can buy like a $70,000 Tesla on apple
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.660]   You can you literally
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:54.500]   So i'm looking at my model three and it says well you got put down 2,500 bucks and we'll start building it
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.140]   Pay here with apple pay
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.540]   For people with a high credit score and a low impulse control
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.660]   Well didn't we had that story on macrae usually like one to go with it
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.100]   My wife's looking at me shaking her head. I didn't do it
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.940]   Remember there was that story in the uk where the guy bought the blen the Bentley on apple pay
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.980]   He was the biggest apple transaction ever the roles I forget what it was
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   But he just dropped the whole thing on apple
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.500]   Can you buy slide belts with apple pay?
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.820]   You got to do that guys
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.140]   I'm got to do the apple pay slide belt thing
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.340]   Boop
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.860]   I tell you what when I see an ad on instagram if I can't pay for an apple pay
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.820]   Okay, or amazon pay
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.540]   I just I don't got filling stuff on my phone in the middle of the night
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:38.660]   Yeah, right, especially like that's how I got my free slide belt by the way
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.780]   On the phone in the middle of the night
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:48.100]   Especially especially with in traveling all I will I will use a contactless payment
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:55.140]   Definitely if I want like a soda if I want to get something if I can't use it and I have to be God forbid use the swipe
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.540]   It's like
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.100]   Living in the stone ages again
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.900]   At least it's not security. I don't worry. I don't worry about contactless pay
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:10.020]   I don't worry about NFC whereas I'm the guy ever since I saw the video where it's not just
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:17.540]   ATMs and not just gas pumps now, but also there are people who are sneaking an entire like front bezel
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.340]   Over the point of sale card readers now
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.620]   That is just like a like a like a hat
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.820]   Exactly what is it say
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.780]   Well, no, it's like a complete duplicate of again
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:36.500]   You're at the register and here's the keypad and the swipe that you have to use and someone just distract and distracts the the
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.660]   Clerp one second puts that on top of it snaps this new this new top on top
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.620]   It looks exactly like the old one they couldn't do that with apple pay, right?
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.820]   You couldn't steal app you wouldn't get the one-time token. Yeah, yeah
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:52.820]   Yeah, it wouldn't be any good to you when we were in Chicago the waiter took the card and we were just like our mouths dropped down
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:58.580]   We haven't seen that in a decade like taking our cards someplace. We can't see it. What that's what we do here in America
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   You can just don't know
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.580]   I know the first time I bought I used a credit card in Europe
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.420]   And they came to the table with this card reader as like blown away
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.620]   But here because here in the States the waiter always takes your card
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.060]   That's yeah, we always have the card reader isn't that they did bring it to your table
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:19.460]   So Lisa doesn't know that I just bought this with apple pay
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:24.100]   No, it's a party going on in here
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.900]   We saw this
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.540]   Electric bike in Tahoe and I said oh my god. It looks like an Indian
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.660]   It looks like one of those old motors the 1920s motorcycles
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:42.260]   And I just I couldn't resist and and if it weren't for apple pay I probably wouldn't have if I had a like give them cash or write a check
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.260]   canceling your cards immediately
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.460]   She can't cancel my watch
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:55.140]   Yeah, see that that's one of them phony electric bikes where it'll go 25 miles an hour even if you ain't pedaling
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:55.940]   Oh, yeah
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:01.460]   My electric my electric bike it don't move unless I move this is a loop. This is what we call a loop hole
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.620]   Electric bike
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:11.060]   Electric bike just got pedals, but they're just digital. Yeah. Yeah, you don't actually use them there. It's still it's a
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:16.740]   Yeah, they've got hooks pedals. Isn't that okay see Alex wants it now super 73
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.020]   Super 73
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:25.300]   It's I know them. I've read about the makers. They actually modeled it after like a 1970s like mini bike
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.500]   You know look at the it's got a headlamp like an old motorcycle
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.620]   It looks like the bice the motorcycle at Lawrence of Arabia died on is what it looks
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.500]   what it looks like
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.260]   Okay, I'm just saying
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.260]   All right
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.460]   Apple pay I'm telling you it makes you spend money it makes you
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:50.420]   Spend yeah money. Oh, that's that's exactly right another one. That's why it's that's why it's a guts and retailers
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.740]   Like so
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.220]   She says it's okay if you buy one, but you got to buy another one now
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.700]   Everything I buy I have to buy two of them that's Leo togetherness
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.340]   Just it if if you're really going to be fair
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:07.780]   Like if you're buying a belt for for Alex, you should buy me one of those bicycles
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.020]   So we come out. Oh, you don't want the belt. You want the bicycle. I was sending you the belt
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.780]   Well, I'm well. I'm saying that for each getting one thing. I didn't know you're saying
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.460]   It's too bad. Oh, so you don't your like on a
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:26.020]   You you get a belt and you get a belt and you get you know a motorcycle
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.740]   Probably like hijack someone's yes
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:33.780]   I can I can now hijack you when you're from from your bike with my belt
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.380]   Can can you run as fast as this but as this motorist? Excuse me
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.260]   Particular show wait they come by
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.580]   Just look at it. I think you can pedal it
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:47.540]   I think you know, I'm like the greatest scape you can't you can't get me that way, man
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.180]   That's what it looks like the greatest scape the steam all I'm I
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:54.820]   No, I'll have my mad max like bike chain like the one that weighs 80 pound like right
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.140]   I
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.940]   I'll slap your leather against my my tooled steel
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:06.180]   So explain to me what this means because I I saw this and I saw people going crazy about this apple has said
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.740]   They're going to eliminate the affiliate
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:14.180]   Program form from apps and in app purchases on october 1st
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.620]   And I have so many feelings about this leo so I mean
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:23.940]   You apple has always had an affiliate program. They originally had it for iTunes music and expanded to itunes movies and tv
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.580]   Just to explain what that is if I put a link to a song
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:31.140]   On my website that I really like and it's a link back to apple music
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:33.220]   I can get a percentage of that sale
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:38.180]   Yes as long as you belong to the program and the program was you used to be outsourced then apple got their own program
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.580]   And you'd get a specially crafted link it have to go and make it
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.820]   It wasn't quite a game of some of the other one. Yeah, it wasn't quite as convenient as amazon
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.060]   But it was possible and then you'd get a little bit of money
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:52.180]   And it changed a lot over the years for example the window like if you click the link and then you bought several things
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.940]   You get referral fee for all of that but the time of that window got shorter
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:01.620]   Last year famously apple was going to reduce the rates and then they changed their minds but still reduced the rates for in app purchases
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:06.740]   Uh, and now they're going to be eliminating the program entirely come october
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:12.420]   And we used to be able to pay a full-time app editor off of the commission that we got off from affiliate
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.860]   But that was in the heyday of apps and it's slowly actified over the years
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:20.900]   So when this news came out, I went and asked the people who do that at mobile nations at i'm more and they're like
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.900]   barely registers
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:27.300]   Anymore and we've been running android central without any google affiliate revenue ever
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.740]   So it really because some people panicked that it would suddenly mean that nobody would review apps anymore because there was no affiliate revenue
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:37.380]   But google sites have never gotten affiliate revenue and they've run reviews just fine for years
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.300]   But it really is it's one of those things that it's so hard to exist
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:47.380]   In in this medium in this business and every year you have to worry about google changing the way that
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:53.460]   Their algorithm works and maybe your page of use drop off amazon has changed affiliate revenue is they've
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:59.540]   They've removed people from the program some quite famously and then your revenue plummets like that ever happened to wirecutter
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:00.820]   That's game over
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:06.260]   Um, and apple's adjusted this it's almost like darth vader saying you know pray. I don't alter the bargain again
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:10.580]   And you try to have enough of these little irons in the fire. I don't alter the bargain
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.780]   Exactly
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:16.740]   You try to have enough of these and for some sites like touch arcade said it's going to be devastating to them because they were still
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:22.580]   Uh, pridom predominantly fed off of affiliate revenue most other sites moved off of it because like I said the bottom
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:29.940]   Filled out years ago primarily because the app economy left premium apps almost nobody buys like upfront paid apps anymore
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.620]   They get netflix and there's a subscription, but you don't see any revenue from the subscription
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.660]   You get a game that's free and then they buy in app purchases
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.140]   But they didn't click your link to get that in app purchase ever so you didn't get any revenue from that so oh
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:45.060]   That's interesting. So the only way you'd get the revenue for the in app purchases if somehow
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:50.260]   They did it like immediately after they downloaded the app or you know you you linked
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:55.380]   I don't even know if you can it was 7% I mean that was a very good chunk of change. Yes
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:02.580]   Um except it was 7% of premium apps of which almost nobody bought those don't exist and then they dropped the rate for in app purchases
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:08.180]   To two and a half percent last which almost nobody converted on because nobody bought those purchases immediately
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.340]   So is that part of this is that apple
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.780]   Uh
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.940]   By the way, it didn't cost apple anything they would just take it out of the 30. Well, I guess it did right
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.340]   If they took it out of the 30 percent. Yeah
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:23.380]   Also, they have to administer it which was an annoyance to them, but uh, they
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:28.020]   There's a bunch of theories some people think apple's gonna change this the split for developers
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.860]   And this is a way of minimizing the impact to apple
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.860]   I think that's incredibly optimistic
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.820]   This point to sort of sort of guess why apple's doing it
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:39.220]   I just think that they saw almost no value in the program anymore and
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.060]   There was two really bad things about it. One was that they did it
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:49.060]   The right after like right before so right after announcing record setting earnings, especially for the app store
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:54.660]   And on the end of becoming a trillion dollar company. Yeah, and also the language they used was a bizball
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:59.780]   I can't believe anybody in corporate communications was involved with this because they would have they're all decent folks
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.660]   They would have flags immediately, but they basically made it sound like okay
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:08.740]   We know we put you you put us through college, but now that we've graduated we have a hotter younger better version of you so buy
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.900]   And that's just not the way you should ever talk to anybody who helped you build business
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.140]   The way the way they're the way they're saying oh well
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:20.820]   We feel as though these personalized recommendations aren't necessary now that we have an app store that recommends
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:28.500]   Reconends apps by by procedure. It's like, okay, that is that rain. I'm absolutely on rene side here
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.700]   That's like the most tone deaf way to put it whatsoever
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:36.180]   Because and also there are a lot of people who are just aren't developers that excuse me
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:43.220]   People that aren't really happy with the fact that you can sort of when when users do a search for an app you can buy
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:51.300]   You can buy search results and simply say whenever someone asks for Alex Lindsey's crazy crazy awesome calculator app
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:55.380]   I want you to insert results for andes kind of half
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.020]   half arsed
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:03.300]   Barely functional for function calculator so that that will appear in the search results for this popular app as well
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.620]   so
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:10.420]   I would like to know why it was so important to cut off even this small amount of revenue
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.900]   uh from people it would seem as though
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:18.660]   Uh, if it's not a whole lot of money unless this program is costing apple all whole lot of money to administrate it
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:22.900]   You may as well just keep it going until you sit until your excuse is that
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:28.500]   People just excuse me uh affiliates just aren't taking advantage of this program anymore
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:32.340]   And therefore we can't keep it running for the handful of people that are still using it
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.020]   So we touch arcade was the one that was really upset, right?
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:42.260]   Yeah, well a lot of developers too because a lot of developers would give would use the affiliate program as a way of taking
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:47.780]   So there's no in a lot of businesses if you provide the direct referral you don't pay as high a commission rate
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.420]   But apple is just the 30 for everybody so they would get their own affiliate program light sign up
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:58.340]   They would provide the link on their page then they would get 7 back so instead of paying apple 30 for the app store
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:04.260]   Cut they would end up being like 23 percent was whatever the transactional changes were and now that's gone for them too
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.820]   So they're paying that 30 percent uh every time and that's well, and you know, it could have been
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.900]   It was a nice page like
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.860]   We haven't seen we haven't seen the the you know, of course
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:19.700]   We don't have access to the back end but it could have been that apple realized that a vast majority of everyone that's getting checks from them
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.460]   Is actually are actually developers going?
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:26.580]   You know putting that link on just to get another 7 percent and just decided
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.900]   Well, let's get rid of it rather than saying, oh developers can't do that. They just said, you know
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.340]   We're not gonna fuss. It's not worth it
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.500]   It was just cut it off and and there isn't that much money going out
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:35.700]   There's probably
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.900]   There's probably a small number of people touch arcade being one of them
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:44.740]   I'm not saying that there's lessons of the impact on them, but they so that's probably a handful of sites that are a little money going on this
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:51.620]   There's probably no I there may be a handful of there may be a handful of sites that this is their chief source of revenue
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:54.100]   I asked around I bet you there's yeah go ahead
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.500]   Let's say I asked around and what I heard consistently from several people is that
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.340]   You know apple likes the program they would they might bring it back one day
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.100]   But when they were running the numbers there was just they and it's been for a couple of years
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.820]   They've just been sustaining it because they thought they should sustain it
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.540]   And it just didn't make financial sense for them going forward and that to me is incomprehensible
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:19.220]   But you know I none of these people are people who would just tell me a story. So I don't know what those looks like internally, but
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.300]   yeah
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.820]   it does kind of
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.820]   Add some shading to
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.660]   This wonderful and really interesting news that hey apples a trillion dollar company
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.860]   Because whereas it might have been sort of irksome
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:35.540]   That oh well they're canceling this program that helped a lot of very small people out
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:41.460]   But but wasn't really working out for apple or they've decided to stop giving you including
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:44.580]   In the iphone that doesn't have a headphone jack
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.860]   They're gonna not they're not they're gonna stop packing in the
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:53.940]   The adapter that might cost them 89 cents to to put in there the extension cord in the max
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:58.820]   It yeah, it would be it would be irksome if they were simply making
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:03.780]   Making oil company level profits bucks like hey you're a trillion dollar company
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:08.500]   And you really can't give me this simple dongle to make my life a little bit easier
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:14.260]   They did I mean the only one that they did do is they took that extension cord out of the macbook pro
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:19.300]   I just scavenged it from some old magsafe adapter that I need anymore, but
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.140]   But the point is like they didn't want they didn't want to make the box bigger, which is a ludicrous
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:27.780]   ludicrous thing the way they think about it like sometimes apple just does stupid things
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.900]   But sometimes it's just the thinking yeah is really it's like apple does not culturally know how to run at a loss
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.980]   Like the app store they were willing to have its subsistence
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:39.860]   But they were worried that the free apps would cost more than they were bringing in ha ha you look 10 years later
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.740]   Not even a concern
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.020]   But they were legitimately worried that it would cost them money to run the app store in the beginning
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.780]   And they just can't culturally accept that even if they don't make money off the affiliate program
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.660]   It's a nice thing to do and you know they'll they'll think about it for a while
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.060]   But it's like oh it's costing us money. We don't run it a lot. Sorry
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:58.020]   Well, and also that they don't run it a small profit, you know like like you know that they you know
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.860]   They weren't losing money on the airport extreme
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.940]   They weren't losing money
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:07.060]   I was close like they would sometimes pay more for a movie than they'd sell it for but on average it would work out to zero
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.100]   And they were fine with that but under zero they were not fine with
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:16.580]   All right. Yeah, by the way, there were a couple of stories about apple pay. I dropped out when we were talking about apple pay
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.700]   A chase atms are going to start using it
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.380]   16 000
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.940]   Chase atms least as happy about that i'm happy about that because we just moved our bank to chase
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.500]   So now we can use apple pay there
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.180]   um
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.180]   That's kind of cool
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:38.020]   Well, just remember that anytime you see these news items, it's great for everybody who's using contactless payments is never
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:42.020]   It's never that chase is exclusively using apple pay whenever you say apple pay
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:50.820]   Excuse me and the nfc implementation of it. You're also talking about android pay or also as matter of fact the chase atms will also work with sam san pay
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.820]   Oh, that's a good point. It's touch to pay right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a very good point
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.540]   although consumer reports
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:00.580]   Says apple pay is the highest rated mobile
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.540]   peer-to-peer payment service now. This is not for
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:07.380]   Paying things this is for paying friends
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:12.500]   Right and they compared it splitting the check. Yeah, they compared it to venmo cash
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.740]   Facebook and zell which is the bank app
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:22.020]   Uh, and it was it's kind of way in a way in the lead on that one 76
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:28.980]   Uh comparative 69 for venmo 64 for cash 63 for facebook and 50 for zell
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:36.100]   And they're based it on payment authentication, which is as high as it can get for apple pay data security
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.420]   Also very high data privacy is high as it can get everything else by the way
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:44.980]   In data privacy is a red downward arrow except for apple pay
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:52.420]   Uh customer's customer support they say venmo's a little better there as is zell and broad access
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.180]   apple pay
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   Is fairly low because of course you have to have an iphone or an apple watch to use apple pay
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:03.860]   But they do call they do call it the digital standard so apple pay also may start to become that's a fairly new
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:10.420]   Feature and apple pay the peer-to-peer payments. Yeah, it's only in the u.s. Still I think oh is it you can't do apple pay cash
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.660]   Yeah, oh too bad because I was kind of says you
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.660]   And he's bike now this
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:25.140]   Uh, let's take a break because I uh, I don't know about you guys, but I need some coffee and olive oil
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:29.780]   Get the i'm drinking leo did you guess what i'm drinking olive oil?
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.340]   No, i'm drinking coffee. Are you drinking tres pontas? I am it is
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   It is my intelligence my sport
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.060]   Invincibly now you're gonna feel terrible because
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:43.460]   I'm breaking out the crustini
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:50.900]   We decided to do all demos today
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:55.540]   Right out the crustini here the uh, you know, it was like when those cupcakes are there
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.220]   Cupcakes
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.660]   Magnabbit
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:03.460]   So the same folks I really got this is very interesting the same folks who bring us tres pontas
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:08.180]   Uh coffee, which is just as you say fabulous fabulous coffee
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.780]   They realize, you know, there are a lot of
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.340]   these single family
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.900]   Products that are gourmet quality
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.020]   Maybe we should expand a little bit
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:25.700]   They went over to chile and they found a the casablanca valley one of the few valleys in chile
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.500]   Perfect for growing olive oil. Basically. It's the same climate as greece and italy
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:36.660]   And you know, I don't know if you saw recently was a 60 minutes report in italyan olive oil olive oil from other countries that is being
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.780]   adulterated with canola oil and other stuff
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:45.460]   Yep, terrible in fact I stopped buying italyan olive oil because I just didn't know if I could trust it
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.260]   Tres pontas olives are picked
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:52.420]   every every uh, it's sent in hosemy gels orchard
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.940]   There's hosemy gell holding the olives
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.100]   They use uh, five varietals if you're an olive guy you'll you'll recognize frantoyo
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.740]   Arbakina lechino croatina and arbosana olives
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:12.980]   They use natural pressure no heat no chemicals to extract them and you're getting the first press
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:18.900]   Which means it is the most delicious first of all look how green this is it's so beautiful
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:24.180]   It is so flavorful and there's something else that you might be interested with olive oil
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.940]   acidity first press they allow the acidity I think to go up to six or seven percent
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:36.180]   Um, and you'll notice this you'll get some extra virgin olive oil and it's got a tangy's acidic
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.580]   flavor to it
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:42.660]   Tres pontas evil is less than 0.2 percent in every bottle
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.980]   and i've fabbled
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.580]   for cooking
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.820]   For just dipping your bread into this
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.420]   Did you i we set you a bottle right Alex did you get yours? Yeah

[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.740]   Well, it needs to be dipped you know what it's so affordable you can cook with it in fact i didn't
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:17.620]   Think about everything tastes better when you use the better olive oil in it
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.820]   I got I get I make popcorn with this stuff
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:26.500]   I've I've I just decided to try it as a salad dressing nothing else on it
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.660]   Oh, isn't that good just like I didn't make anything else just like i'm just gonna put

[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:41.060]   We're switching over. I mean, it's all I've switched but yeah, we absolutely we uh
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:46.900]   We were just finishing off the stuff. It's there and cooking and but I was like, I'm not sure where to buy it
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.620]   So I don't want to run out. I can help you with this
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.820]   I'm glad you asked
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:57.620]   Before I tell you where you get it though. Let me show you this. This is really cool. Just like the trace ponter's coffee
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.540]   This was such a hit
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.140]   They decided to put the qr code of where the olives are from
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.620]   On the back of the bottle. So you just you put your phone next to the qr code
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:12.180]   And you'll get a link to google maps and you can literally see the olive tree
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:18.100]   There it is right there. That's the actual grove that this olive oil came from
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.740]   There is I mean talk about
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.780]   Incredible and I should point out as as you know, Alex. We live in olive country
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.180]   There are some very good olive oils here
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:33.300]   This is better than the gourmet expensive olive oil that we get just down the road
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.940]   It is the least acidic they guarantee the acidity is less than 0.2 in every bottle
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:42.580]   0.2 in every bottle it is smooth. It is fresh
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.620]   No bitter after taste. This is the highest quality olive oil I've ever tasted
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.860]   You'll want to use it all the time and you can get it. You can get a subscription if you want
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:57.060]   That's what I would do get it sent to you every one or two or four weeks free shipping in the us
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.260]   Uh, if you get it if you sign it, okay
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.420]   So what you can do just just as with the coffee
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.580]   In fact, you could by the way mix and match
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.500]   If you want and get the five of your bottle, Alex and you'll never run out
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:13.460]   But do you see that price take 20% off because here's what we're going to do when you go to trace ponter's.com

[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.820]   and uh

[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.380]   I am kind of an olive oil kind of sir because I grew up on it
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:27.220]   So is Lisa because she won't do vinegar on herself. She only does olive oil
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:28.900]   and
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.860]   We've we you know when we were we were in Paris
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:37.380]   No, it was London at a hotel and then some French olive oil when we started buying that because it was so good
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:42.740]   This is better. This is the best I've ever had and the price is right especially when you take that 20% discount
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.620]   Trace hey, if you're um, yes, you would
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.940]   If you're in in petaluma if you go to portworx and get their sonomic
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.700]   Red and you just drop a little of that into the into the
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:59.220]   Is that a vinegar or is it poor? It's a it. It's no. It's kind of halfway in between
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.700]   and it is
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.660]   You'll go through the bread really fast. Yeah, that's the only problem with that
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.020]   It's like it's like oh
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.660]   T-r-e-s like the number three tress
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.020]   Pontas p-o-n-t-a-s it comes to the mountain
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:21.620]   Where the coffee comes from in in brazil three points tress pontas calm slash mac break t-r-e-s p-o-n-t-a-s
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:26.100]   Calm slash mac break and just to celebrate i'm having a little trace pontas coffee, too
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:32.420]   Safari
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.180]   Safari
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.180]   I'm stunned to read this
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.340]   leads
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:43.540]   in mobile web traffic not desktop of course, but mobile web traffic even beating
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.780]   chrome
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.540]   Which is the default on browser on android
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.820]   uh and
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:56.980]   And even beating facebook although facebook is gaining on chrome
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:05.940]   It's the three top three browsers on mobile our safari chrome facebook and facebook's about to go to number two
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:13.140]   Uh, this comes from mixtape panel. I think I think a lot of that has to do with I don't know very many
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:18.180]   Apple or iphone users that use anything other than safari you don't have really much of a choice
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:23.300]   It's always the default right so it's well, it's the default and it's also just you just don't think about it
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:27.540]   It's so tied into everything that apple does it same way like I still use google maps
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.740]   but
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.100]   You know the vast majority of iphone users just use apple maps because that's what came with it
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.020]   And when they click on it it takes them to that link and
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.660]   That's the power of the of the black one
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:42.900]   The the or the tyranny of the default is sometimes they smart enough to know to separate out browsers that present as safari
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.980]   I hope they are because you're right a lot of browsers. You know you there's a
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.340]   Uh safari presents as mozilla as a backup
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.140]   Yeah, there's a user agent string that when queried the browse actually doesn't even be queried
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:00.260]   The browser actually sends as part of the packet and it can say anything and as you point out
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:03.780]   Sometimes it says the wrong thing so I
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.740]   There may be the only information they have I don't know
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:11.940]   They do say mix this is all again mixed panel late the current split of phones in the us
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.020]   This is also fascinating 65 ios
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.740]   35
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.580]   Android it's actually 65 and a half to 34 and a half
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.860]   So if I add those together that's there is points
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:32.660]   I don't they actually this is that's 100.1.01. So I think there's no room for third party
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:39.620]   Defices the mobile market is dominated by uh by ios 65.5
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:49.380]   In the us of a in the us it's completely it's a actually flipped in the rest of the world but uh, yeah in the us. Yeah
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:56.100]   I mean one of the I so one of the metrics I think is usually better is the amount of e-commerce transactions that go through safari
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.580]   I think those are usually inordinately high as well. Yeah
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:01.780]   But yeah, but apple people buy more stuff, right?
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.540]   Yeah, I mean you have to take all you have to take all
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:10.020]   Nobody knows except for apple and google and they don't really tell us they have those fine-grained numbers
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.100]   All you can do is take a bunch of different people
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:16.100]   Feeling up different parts of the elephant to try to get a clear picture what the animal looks
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:23.780]   It would be totally possible for a website to ask more than just the user agent string to determine if it was safari totally
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:29.940]   Yeah, so yeah, i'm hoping it's the smallest being smarter and doing it right. I imagine they are but I don't know
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:35.060]   So did you see the leaks in ios 12 spada
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:41.620]   And then everybody and their youtuber got a got a dummy unit yesterday, so
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:44.500]   That was a problem
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:50.180]   The same place that always comes from same person. It always comes from every year. Oh, I got that too. Bless them. Bless them
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.260]   Oh, I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, he sent me one too
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.300]   Nice
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.300]   So that's just based on the icon
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:04.660]   But you know so what happened there's so much money involved in the accessory ecosystem
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:09.620]   And a lot of these factories are very close together in China that inevitably somebody manages to bribe somebody
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:15.060]   To get the schematics and then they produce these dummy units which are as close and as accurate as possible
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.300]   To what like they're not functional. They're not an actual i are these for casemakers and people like yeah
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:24.660]   They're for casemakers and other accessory makers and then some of them get sold on the you know on on the
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:31.780]   The market and people pick them up and you know read your suit them to youtubers or to blogs or those kind of things. Okay
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.740]   So there is there being like 3d printed
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:42.260]   Actually, they're often accurate. They're not always last year. There was that whole thing about the the rear touch id sensor that was on a bunch of
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:47.620]   Models that never showed up in the real world in apple said they never built here's I actually didn't get it
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:51.540]   Somebody offered it to me and I I haven't said yes because I don't know why I would do it
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.940]   But there is the demi somebody else holding the dummy
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.420]   Yeah, and a bunch of what uh
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.220]   Videos went up yesterday. It was almost like it was embargo day for iphone
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.140]   I thought dummies
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.620]   So what do we learn from this and also there's an ipad icon in ios 12 too. Yeah
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:11.060]   So yeah, but yeah in addition to the the whatever dummies that we're gotten from uh casemakers
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.300]   We're talking about the usual source of someone decided to go surfing all the way through
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:22.420]   uh the binaries of uh of an upcoming release and they saw an icon of a device that doesn't look like an iphone 10 and they also
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:31.700]   uh found icons of an ipad device that you would say this is can't possibly be an ipad it has so such slim bezels and no home key
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.940]   Unless you work to conclude that oh well perhaps that's what the next ipad is going to look like
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.220]   This has worked in the past with the iphone 10 and the home pod so
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:43.140]   This is not uh completely uh, it's not voodoo
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.260]   The uh the icon's name is hls ipad 2
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:52.740]   compared to the similar icon hls ipad
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:56.260]   It's a transaction symbol. It's I think it's from the apple pay subsystem. Okay
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:00.260]   And so it's home buttonless. It's uh got much smaller bezels
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.620]   But this is what we all figured was going to happen
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:09.460]   Right? Yes. Yeah, they all confirm every rumor that we've seen for the last umpteen months
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.180]   Yeah, this is what you expect. We're what less than a month away
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.100]   Well, actually we're not less than a month if they do it
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.420]   Don't they usually do it the tuesday the week following labor day
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.860]   Uh, it's usually a tuesday in september
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.860]   Yeah, it depends exactly on when it lands
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:29.380]   Labor day is september 3rd so september 11th would normally because they don't want to do it right after labor day
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.580]   Because sometimes they do I mean, but it's definitely an ethnicity at least it has been in all the pre for the last
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:39.380]   I don't know or what you have pointed out because apple has their own facility now. They don't have to book these
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.580]   Months ahead of time. They have some flexibility this year
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.540]   But usually like these
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.340]   Sorry, Andy. You also imagine they like to stay away from that particular date
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:54.100]   You'd be with the 10th of the 12th. Yeah, but they also then I mean they need some time for ramp up
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:57.940]   So they have the event and then usually that friday they go on pre-order
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.340]   Um, 10 days or what is it the next wednesday?
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:05.380]   iOS comes out and the friday they become available in stores
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:10.100]   So depending on when you actually want to launch the thing you have to have the event with enough time in between to handle all that
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.100]   Somebody had an event on september 11th was it is it samson?
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.340]   I remember an event on september 11th and yeah, you would think that people would want to stay away from that
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:22.420]   Uh, certainly apple. I think apple's very sensitive to that kind of stuff
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:27.700]   So but so we don't know um, but we are the point being we are
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   roughly a month away from
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:33.780]   a likely announcement and do you think it will be
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:41.540]   Uh, ipad and iphone we talked about this last week. You still think it'll be all together
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:47.380]   Uh, there was a school of thought that apple didn't want to minimize iphone by sharing the stage with a lot of other things
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:51.220]   And then we had september event two years ago where there was like four or five things
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:56.100]   All announced at the same time the new apple tv and the new ipad pro the first ipad pro and the
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.100]   The iphone and the new apple watch and so they're obviously not adverse to doing that
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:04.580]   So if it makes a lot of sense for them not to have to hold two events people lots of travel over two events
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.500]   Uh, if if everything is ready to show off. I think that's probably their preference
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:14.260]   And then you you mentioned this rumor, uh, that the iphone
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:17.300]   2018 iphone
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.300]   according to bark lays research
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:25.060]   Will not will no longer have the little adapter that goes from lightning to
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.260]   3 and a half millimeter headphone jack
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:33.940]   Yeah, I think they should be adding those adapters to other products not taking them away from this one. Yeah, yeah
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.420]   It costs it costs, uh, nine dollars if you buy it from apple
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.580]   By cost like and I have it
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.460]   Well, it
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:46.820]   It costs 27 to 36 because that's how many you need look floating around so when you forget one
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:54.740]   You have another one. I did I saturated the house with them. I bought somebody. Yeah. Yeah. Now. I will admit that after a lot of
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.740]   uh
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:01.940]   Resistance, uh, the thing I use most of the time now is my airpods, you know, I mean they're just they become
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:08.420]   You know, it's just what what I'm using every day. Um, but that's because you're forced into it
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:15.060]   No, no, I have I have the the adapter and I have I have some edomotics that I that I have sitting with me that I
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:19.780]   You know, they're on my desk almost all the time. That's what I used to wear all the time and when I'm on conference calls
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:20.500]   I
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.820]   Often still put them on because the mic is a little bit better
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:28.420]   But the airpods when you get used to not having the cables I will admit like working out is
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.580]   Amazing you go to the gym. I mean the gym isn't very busy where I work out
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.380]   And so I you just set it somewhere in the middle of the time
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:39.700]   I said my phone somewhere in the middle of the gym and then I just walked around working out then it's
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:45.220]   I've gotten tangled up with my headphones many many times in my in my
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:50.980]   A little career of lifting and uh, and so it's really nice just to have headphones. You just want it about it's so fun
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:55.300]   I see a muscle bound guy like Alex all taught him on the headphones
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:02.500]   It's so fun. I'm gonna miss that Alex and I haven't I haven't been muscle bound for a long time
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:07.220]   I try though. I try I try
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:14.340]   I work at it. I yeah, but muscle bound has not been my problem. Not since nab started your intestine before the show starts. Yeah
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.100]   It's not steroids it's pets
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:21.780]   Supplement my doctors that it was good
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.020]   It's an enhancement
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:31.940]   Um, I don't know if this will affect the uh shipping of the new iphone or ipad
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:39.460]   But tsmc the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company shut down over the weekend last weekend
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:45.780]   Uh saying a computer virus hit its fabrication tools on friday evening
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:49.860]   80 percent have now been restored as of uh yesterday
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.340]   but
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.340]   That means delayed shipments
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:21:03.060]   To customers tsmc builds what the memory in the iphone? What are they build? No, they do the a they will be doing the a12 processor
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.300]   No boy. Oh, that's not good
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:10.020]   Uh, of course, uh, oh two or three day delay
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.980]   Right now probably really isn't good for the iphone
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:19.300]   It really to pay it's hard one bit again like kimiko he says one bit of information
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:25.380]   It's hard to extrapolate. Uh, we don't know how far ahead they were we don't know if this will affect initial supply or their ability to meet
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:31.700]   You know channel inventory or if they had enough already stockpile that it's only going to be a problem if they can't fill in the gap now
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.740]   It's it's really hard to say but it obviously it's not good
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.660]   They're not it's not going to affect the announcement or the time we buy
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.740]   I mean, you know, we all we all know that they're going to be delayed
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:47.220]   It just means that a certain number of people are going to get the you are now two or three weeks rather than you are now two or three days
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:52.260]   You know that I mean it's I don't think that being down for two days is really going to affect any of us
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:55.380]   It is a kind of a cautionary tale for all of us though
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.100]   This is something that's happened to so many businesses. They got bit by want to cry the ransomware
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:06.500]   According to the ceo obviously they are not they are not built running their production company on the max
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:12.740]   Hmm and then I've identified vendor provided the company with an infected tool
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:21.140]   And uh, I guess software tool and they installed it on whatever, you know, obviously not mac and tauch based
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:28.260]   Control i have been somebody if somebody isn't ribbing the ceo of somebody else over the fact that they were down
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:32.020]   You know, well, it's probably those fab machines probably who knows what they run
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:39.940]   But it's probably some what was it a tool related to chip fabrication or was it a pirated version of like overwatch or something?
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:45.140]   That's really why they shut down. They wanted three days to play fortnight. That's exactly what's going on
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:52.100]   They according to bloomberg tsmc is quote expected to be able to fill all orders on time for apple
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.140]   So that's for apple for apple
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:00.580]   You'll have to wait your adelok. Yeah, it helps to be the biggest customer of a company like the smc
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:07.140]   Uh apple is accepting red cross donations. You may have seen that for wildfires in california
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:13.620]   These northern california wild fires are about a hundred miles north of us, but uh, they are it is the largest
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:16.660]   wildfire ever in california history up in
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:21.700]   Medicino and you and it i'm sure those red cross donations will be very much
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:26.020]   welcome so when you see that little pop up in your iTunes
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.260]   You might consider
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.260]   coffin up a little something something
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:37.700]   Uh, tell you who will not be coffin up a little something something the folks who do fortnight have decided not to put it in the google play store
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.700]   It's coming to androids soon
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:44.260]   Uh, they make a lot of money on apple about 150 million dollars a day
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:48.820]   That means apple makes a third of that 50 million dollars unless they've unless they're cutting a deal
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:55.220]   Uh, these are all in app purchases. Tim swiney the ceo of epic says we're not going to do that on google play
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.380]   That's kind of controversial because in order to
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:00.980]   side load a game on google play you have to turn off
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.620]   the third party protection
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:11.140]   android much like apple, uh, unless you turn off that setting will only allow you to download apps from the google official google store
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:16.180]   But unlike apple, they have a switch in settings that let you disable that
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.980]   You I think on modern uh android devices. It's a one-time
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:25.460]   Disabling so it comes back on after you download whatever that was that you wanted
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:31.220]   Unless you want to download it again, then I mean it just seems so ill advised and and not really in the best interest of
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:36.980]   Customers or users. Yeah, and I it's also taking a chance because it does make it that much harder to get it
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:41.780]   Uh, and I think russell holly made this point like when pokemon was available
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:49.460]   Um, you know in one region people rushed to download bootleg versions half of which had malware installed and when it's not coming through the store
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:53.540]   You have no protection against that there's gonna be a bunch of people putting up fake APK mirrors
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:58.260]   And loaded with who knows what and people are gonna download it because they're desperate to get four at night
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:02.740]   I'm sure swiney would have done the same thing with the iphone, but you don't have the option on the iphone
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.660]   You'd have to do enterprise and it's just such a so much overhead. Yeah
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:11.780]   Oh, so you can do it as like an enterprise app side load. Yeah. Yeah, you can create almost like a
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:17.220]   Like the way a corporation would distribute apps to its own customers, but there's just so much overhead that it's probably not worth it for them. Yeah
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:21.060]   Um
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.180]   Apple has this is a tricky one. So we'll
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:30.420]   I'll just say it apple has banned info wars from the podcast directory actually
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:35.540]   Uh, they still sell the info or allow the info wars app on the app store. It's a free one
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:40.340]   Uh, but they are removing info wars most of the info wars podcast from the eye
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:43.460]   Tunes directory following in the lead of a spotify
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:50.340]   Uh and others who have decided to pull Alex Jones's inflammatory they fast followed so they were all
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:56.100]   I forget it was charlie wetsall who was covering it and he said I was talking to youtube and facebook and all these companies and they hemmed and
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:00.020]   HOD for months and then apple apparently eddy q and and tim cook
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:06.260]   Discussed it over the weekend apple made a decision and then everybody everybody except for twitter fell in line immediately after that
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.740]   And they made the decision it says
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.740]   To drop
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.460]   From the pockets is apple insiders drop it from the podcast but not from the app store. Why is that?
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:21.060]   Yeah, I think that came from pacific. Um, they because they didn't believe that it violated the two in terms of the app store
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.780]   Although the way I read them the terms in the app store are not significantly or not at least
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:33.220]   Realistically different than the terms of the podcast app. So I think that you know, you can argue that they violate one they should violate the other
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:38.100]   I I feel as though it's because in the uh podcast store
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:44.980]   You have an apple app that's rendering hateful texts in the form of the description of what the episode is about
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.540]   Whereas you can have a little bit of a distance and say that well, we're just we're just providing an app
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:54.900]   It's the app that is telling people these horrible horrible things about contrails and fake quote fate
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:27:00.580]   Unquote school shootings and such like that, but yeah, there's always there's always been a little bit of a division between content
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:03.620]   That's available through the app store and content. That's available
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:08.660]   Through the itunes store and podcasts that I don't usually the
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.660]   other way
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.780]   Yeah, I mean, it's there's just not a whole lot of consistency
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:19.540]   Uh, there have been there there have been times where these uh, they've banned uh simple like uh, uh reference apps
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:23.940]   Because you could access a naughty word through a wikipedia app
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:27.860]   However, other the same naughty words are okay and explicit
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:31.540]   Tag songs, so it's it's weird
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:36.100]   That was kind of the old days right though. Haven't they fixed is it more consistent now? Is it not?
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   Uh, it's it's still just like
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:43.300]   Yeah, exactly. It's it's I still think that the
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:50.500]   Content approval is still very much a handcrafted hand-tooled artisanal process
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:54.340]   Where yeah, where it's that well, I mean in a sense that
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:28:01.860]   Uh, there are rules, but it depends on the circumstances under which someone is reviewing those rules and who gets bit by them
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.540]   And who gets to slide through them?
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:07.620]   Uh, so they're gonna be always going to be apps that should have been banned but will go through
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:11.780]   Until apple catches them two years. Excuse me catches the mistake two years later
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.300]   And there are always going to be apps that really should have been approved immediately
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:21.860]   Uh, but get banned and they and the developer never really finds out. So it's not uh, it's not it's not a tragedy
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:29.780]   Of apple, but it it's hard to decide that there is a consistent set of rules for why apple does one thing for one store
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:33.140]   Or one piece of con even one piece of content and a different one for a different one
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:38.020]   I am obviously not a fan of uh, info wars, but it does make me a little
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:41.140]   queasy
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.420]   um
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:44.420]   I mean, I think even even
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:48.660]   I think that even mark zuckerberg was touching on this when he was talking about nazis and and yeah, they should be
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:54.820]   The quandary that facebook faces and I think they finally got rid of info wars on facebook
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.660]   But they still have a lot of other
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:59.780]   You know hate got rid of hateful or five pages that alex john
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:05.380]   So the thing is that like there's there's a lot of there's very there's huge value in having the discussion because you never want
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:07.940]   You don't want to air too far in one way. You don't want to be
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.740]   But there are lines like for example all of these places these aren't
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:15.780]   Me back up for a second. There's no freedom of speech argument here because there's no freedom of speech on somebody else's dime
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.860]   These are public companies use to not governments
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:22.740]   There's no censorship because no government is ordering them to take these down. They're doing this as editorial decisions
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:26.100]   It's like you you get to control what is on the shelves of your bookstore?
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:31.140]   What is on the shelves of your retail store? That's your decision to make as long as you don't violate any laws and doing it
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:34.420]   And also, I mean this this there are laws of different countries
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.860]   That take effect here
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:40.020]   So you can't just have a us view on this because anything you allow or don't allow the us to do
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.980]   You allow or don't allow china to do and that's just how these things work
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:44.740]   But we have lines for example
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:48.820]   They don't allow porn on almost almost any of these doors and people will say well
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:53.780]   I absolutely know what that is but sometimes there's arguments over male versus female nipples or whether you can have a shot
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:56.420]   of someone breastfeeding or not. We have huge arguments about that
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:00.660]   And it's very different. Yeah, and it's fair to expand that to other content types
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:04.580]   And apple does list a variety of things including like you can't show murder
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:11.140]   And we should say it's not a first amendment issue because the first amendment protects you against government and intervention
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:14.020]   Any private business can do whatever it wants
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.180]   And I think the company's but a private business because people get confused about that too
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:21.300]   Public companies means there's public shareholders doesn't mean it's a government
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:27.300]   And the I think what a lot of these folks are trying to traipse around also is becoming liable for
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:33.060]   For making decisions in general. So as they start to say we're going to take this content out
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:36.180]   Then people are going to say well, you need to start making decisions all the time
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:37.780]   That's the slippery slope or you could be sued
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:43.140]   Or you could be sued if if this was put on, you know, it opens them up to all kinds of lawsuits
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:45.940]   You know, and that's the and so a lot of them are like
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:50.180]   I don't know if we should do that and I think that they got to a point with with him that
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:54.340]   They decided that he just wasn't knows it was it was worth the trouble
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:58.340]   But a bit also there's I think that there's a cultural problem that has to be overcome
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:03.700]   Uh with companies like facebook and twitter historically from the very very get-go
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:07.860]   Uh, they have been under the classic initial internet model
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:14.180]   Which says that all we're doing is we're providing servers servers and software so the people can publish their own opinions
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:19.860]   It is not not our legal or moral responsibility to control what that speech is and
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:26.260]   Uh, and the digital communications, excuse me the uh, uh, copyright, uh, DCM
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.740]   Sorry, same DCM
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.820]   The mca
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:36.420]   In in a sense sort of tells them that you are explicitly not editors like a newspaper
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:38.980]   You are simply providing a hosting service
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:42.820]   So it's not just a legal thing. It's that they they have built these organizations
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.700]   Around the idea that we are hands-off not again
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:51.300]   Not as an not as an altruistic thing, but that this is not a product that we have or an infrastructure that we have ever
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:58.340]   Uh, been that we ever built this thing to do and so, uh, they now they have a responsibility to control
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:04.100]   Some of these the speech and now that they have to really make these things happen within a very short period of time
[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:11.460]   They are very much fumbling because once again you're you're trying to take you're trying to take a gasoline powered car make it run on electricity
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:17.380]   It was never a built with the anticipation that it would ever have to have this fundamental character installed inside it
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.340]   And so they're need to be held responsible. They need to get there
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:24.580]   But it's going to take a couple of years for them to figure out exactly how to redefine themselves
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.020]   As people who are constantly taking a look at the content that's being
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:33.540]   That's being processed through their servers and making sure that nothing harmful or excuse me
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:38.580]   Not nothing that is uh objectively and you have to use air quotes around objectively harmful
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.980]   Uh, is is used through their service
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:43.860]   I don't know. I mean
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.900]   It's yeah
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.900]   There has to be a line, but we have to argue
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:52.980]   Prociously and all the time to make sure that it doesn't go too far either way. Yeah
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:56.020]   Hmm fair enough
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:00.260]   Uh, let's see. What else do we want to talk about before we uh
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:03.300]   Back out of this show here
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:08.260]   Uh french lawmakers banning smartphones for kids under 15 in schools
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.180]   Good luck. Yeah
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:19.620]   Skype is back. Microsoft is backtracked and said all right. We'll let you keep using classic
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.020]   They call it classic skype
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.980]   For a while skype. I guess seven. They went to skype eight
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:27.220]   Non-electron it's like with the escape bar
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:30.980]   I am just amazed at how i'm amazed at how microsoft was able to take a
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:33.940]   mediocre slightly below average
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:38.100]   Uh, you know software and just keep going down
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.660]   Like it was like dude you're on skype right now. It's amazing. It works great. Oh my god
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:47.220]   Like democracy every time you get
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:52.740]   Here's the deal is that when when apple when apple when apple and oftentimes google like when there's an update
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:57.380]   You're excited about what's gonna happen next when you find out there's gonna be a skype update every single time you're like, yes
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:02.820]   It's terrifying. I just wanted to be a stable platform. Yeah. I wanted to I wanted to
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:06.660]   I wanted to be relying on it the other day. That's the program we use more than any other
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:12.980]   A twist I wanted to do a screen a screen share the other day with somebody and and um and I opened up
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.660]   And I couldn't find screen share in the new version. I was like, I can't find screen share
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.940]   So I closed it I opened hangouts. I sent another link. Boom. Okay. We're done
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:22.100]   You know, like I just you know like
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.820]   And it worked fine and and and I think that that is a
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.140]   Uh, that's not a good thing for
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:30.900]   Microsoft for me to just just you know very quickly just move on because now it is easy
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:32.900]   Whether i'm going to zoom or hang out or whatever
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:37.540]   You really have to decide whether you know skype makes sense and I don't know where I still don't know where screen
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:45.940]   Sharing went. I'm just amazed that Microsoft thought they would have any luck in trying to get people to stop using an obsolete
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:52.740]   Endangers and inferior old copy of their code given that there's still how many wind copies of windows like xp and critical
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:58.820]   Critical installation still running right? Yeah, i'm gonna expect it's still on like windows 2000. I think
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:01.780]   Um
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.740]   Are you using somewhere? I'm sure you are very very well
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:10.100]   I'm sure somewhere you are rina using the beta of uh mohavi, right? Yes
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:13.860]   You like it stable going well, yeah
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:18.260]   Uh, it's been really really good. I mean the only problem i've had is that google hangouts hasn't been working on it
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:22.660]   So i've been using a high crm machine for that, but everything else has been working on it pretty good
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.500]   Yes
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:30.180]   Everything google hangouts is like a remarkable program on high caira the camera stopped working for like three months and now on
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:34.500]   I'm gonna have it just the whole thing doesn't work. Oh, there's where the audio stopped working. It sounds like a robot
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:41.940]   But yeah, everything else has been great. So I don't know if you've seen this this I guess showed up in beta 6 the new migration assistant
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.500]   Has an extra little button there. Look at that
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:51.300]   Uh, how do you want to transfer your information from a mac time machine backup or startup disc from a windows pc
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.940]   Oh
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:36:01.140]   There's a little shot across the uh bow at redman there. So this is going to be more capable in terms of uh importing
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:08.980]   Stuff from windows. Yeah, I wish for trusser lay was still around to announce this because he would have done the bang up job on stage
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:11.540]   uh, microsoft outlook
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:14.100]   uh other accounts
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:18.500]   Uh, I don't know uh probably nobody's daring to use it at this point
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.380]   It's everything your mac can understand so that if you can type it in man
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:24.340]   You know your mac this just helps you by pulling it straight from the windows machine
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.620]   So that like it won't give you things that don't exist on the mac obviously
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:31.380]   But it will it will take things like outlook that you can actually enter into your accounts
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:34.100]   Not to add one on system preferences and do that for you good
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:39.140]   Anything else you can use migrate from from the mac. No, I always start clean. I think it's just
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.300]   Yeah, I just want to start. Yeah, that's a bad idea
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:46.500]   I have everything like my whole documents directories and drop box now. So I just open up a machine, um install drop box
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.820]   All my documents are there and I don't want the cruff that's
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:52.420]   Built up. Yeah, I don't use drop box for that use my synology nast
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:55.540]   But that's yeah, that's one of the best things in the world is I have a you know
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.260]   Probably a three gigabyte documents folder and it just propagates to every machine I install
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.940]   Takes it a little while to download it all because it's downloading from my house
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:09.140]   Uh, but it's sure nice to have because then then I don't have to worry about backup really although
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:14.900]   I love this on this new macbook pro. I decided you know, I'm gonna be a little bit more careful about it. I got one of those
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.060]   Samsung teeth what is it the t5 drives the little
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:21.220]   portable drives
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.740]   And super duper set it up super duper anytime you see uh that drive
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:30.420]   Just make sure that it's uh duplicate the internal and the external and so I just periodically just plug it in
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.900]   Thunderbolt 3 now
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:38.340]   And very quickly within half an hour. Um, I've got a uh bootable backup on an external drive
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:41.300]   I really like that
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:43.300]   jailbreak for apple watch
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.500]   How exciting?
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:51.460]   Just what I mean apple watch it does not have an easy user, um
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.500]   Restart button so I would be do not do this
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:59.380]   But it's worth it to be able to run pla finally play doom on the watch
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:04.580]   No, I mean there is a huge argument to be made that apple should allow you iKit apps on the apple watch
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:08.180]   Especially as a performance increases. Yes, you'll have to pay a battle or a battery fine
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:12.820]   But apples apps or ui kit. They're not you know watch kit the way that third party apps are I get all that
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:16.580]   I just don't think people outside like steve taut and smith should be playing with that stuff
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:19.540]   This would be a
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:21.540]   It is on github if you want, uh
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.500]   T i h m s t a r
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:27.380]   jailbreak time. It's called
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500]   I mean you be there's
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.620]   This i doubt this they're going to deliver anything to the watch that you'd want to have a part of but it is
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:43.220]   Significant that that anytime that they ios devices jailbroken it means that somebody was able to exploit some sort of security
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:48.500]   That was in there to prevent people from putting their own code on the device it exploits the kernel
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:52.100]   Is using some alarm that it ticks. Yeah, right if anything else
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:55.940]   This is this is an alarm that apple is going to have to address something and i'm sure we'll see an update soon enough
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:39:03.060]   It's a service it's a service because it's not it's the uh, it is some hacker that's having fun rather than the nsa
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.540]   That's it. You know when that when I was caught twisting doorknobs on my campus late at night on on labs
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:09.700]   That's what I said. I'm just testing to see which dirt roars
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.100]   Which locks faulty it's uh, it's pen testing you'll know about it in about 10 years
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:16.660]   Exactly. Yeah
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.060]   Have you tried the new apple music friends mix
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:22.820]   I saw it haven't had a chance to try it yet. Yeah
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:27.860]   Well, a lot of people have been following me and I was wondering why I guess it must be this I don't know
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:34.500]   So you you're you're basically it's a mix based on your uh, the people you're following your friends profiles or or what?
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:42.180]   Updates on monday's favorites mix up days on tuesday's new music mix on fridays the chill mix on sundays
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.980]   So get your mixes kids

[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:55.060]   Well, I think the thing the thing that I turned off and spotify almost immediately is show everybody what i'm what i'm uh,
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:40:01.380]   Really? What are you hiding? Yeah, I don't want to I just don't want people to know how much I like here kitty parry
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:06.180]   It's so funny because it's exactly what I don't want people to know
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:11.060]   I want I want to give you the strength to be your true self
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.460]   I will tell you right here right now
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:17.700]   That uh, I on my my wake up in the morning sort of uh,
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:22.580]   Action that's on my my my google assistant includes a playlist that includes
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:25.140]   dancing queen by abba
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:28.340]   You should you should be dancing by the vegis and
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:35.380]   It's raining men by the weather girls. Wow because these are these are them. These are the songs that get my butt out of bed
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:38.340]   And yes, fruging and boogaloo
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.180]   I and i'm proud i'm proud of that
[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:46.980]   So you're gonna watch what I listen to when I went to jim I think that they would think there was something very wrong with
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.860]   He's like very angry
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.900]   It's like rage against the machine
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:55.540]   I was like
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:57.540]   You need to be agra if you're gonna be pumping that iron
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:02.820]   That same playlist contains one of my favorite divo songs since I was a kid
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:09.380]   And uh, we're asked apparently when I was 16 years old in high school. I can be singing along to the lyrics
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:15.540]   I'm a man with a mission a boy with a gun. I've got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one who doesn't know
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:22.420]   I'm a big mess. Oh boy. Whatever in 2018. I always different meaning doesn't it? That's not that loud
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.940]   So it's
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:27.940]   the second the
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.940]   Not an nutritionalist, but
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:37.460]   I was new a lot of divo as a kid. Yeah, is that okay? I thought it was a hillary def song. I'm sorry
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.700]   Uh
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:44.740]   In the for you section you get your mixes, right? So i'm looking at for you. There's the favorites mix
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:53.220]   There's the chill mix the new music mix. Where's my friends mix man? I can see what friend mix that I can see what friends are listening to
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:56.420]   You guys have terrible taste
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:03.860]   But uh, and I and some recommended friends who I don't know. I don't see the uh friends mix. Yes. Yeah, but I guess maybe next monday. I'll get
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:07.700]   All right. I like apple music. I have to say
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:12.660]   Yeah, I don't know, you know, I I have them all and I can't decide which i'm gonna end up with
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:17.780]   So I got a chance today apple music was well beats one was actually a Montreal for the ocega
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:21.300]   That's the one I got to interview one of the shimmy chewy at denuga
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.140]   I love july at de nukeans. Oh, all right. Okay. He was awesome
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:28.500]   And they were just what I didn't realize and I started to find out with the home pod
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:32.740]   But really when I talked to matt is that apple music they don't just like play the music
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:37.700]   They actually go to almost every region every location they have editors in cities
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:42.180]   Who whose only job it is is to find and break new music and they work with the talent
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.380]   They try to encourage them and try to help them get you know popular and
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:50.020]   And it's really it's really a cool thing for music because they're at their grille
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:51.780]   They're at all the festivals talking to the new axe
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.580]   Um, and they were they knew all about like the axe from like sudbury ontario and lenti. That's really cool
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.500]   ball parts of the real
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:04.020]   They take it seriously. How much you think they make they must make a lot of money to be a apple beats
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:07.620]   DJ I well, I don't know how much the DJs make but like
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:11.780]   The music stuff because they're they're getting like the small end off the percentage
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:15.460]   It's not anywhere nearly as much as what sales used to be but I think it's a huge differentiator
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:19.460]   So again increase the value of having an iPhone because you can get like apple music all the stuff with it
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.980]   So it's like making your own silicon
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:24.980]   It's wise to invest in it because it overall it increases the overall value of your product. Right, right
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:28.420]   I'm
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:31.700]   My my favorites mix it really does reflect poorly on me
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:34.660]   Old
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:38.020]   Uh, madonna gangbang lady gaga the fame
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:42.820]   Jonathan colton curl matchbox 20 real world bruno mars when I was your man
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:45.140]   Beyonce naughty girl
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:47.540]   Rihanna kiss it better. Neil young mr
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:53.460]   So you should never have rianna next to nyl young i'm sorry. I will not I will not listen to you playlists shamed yourself
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:56.260]   I am shamed. I am shamed
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:59.300]   I don't know where they get stuff. Yeah
[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:02.260]   You should be dancing
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:04.020]   Yeah
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:10.020]   Pentagon Roger Whittaker. Where's the Roger Whittaker? There's a ship lies. No, no, you're gonna get any in me doing our
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:13.780]   Oh
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:19.300]   Right, let her hear mr
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:26.100]   Cook your recent favorites mix did not include any Roger Whittaker. I don't understand it
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.940]   all right
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.180]   Pentagon bans finally
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:34.100]   Geolocation services on iPhones apple watch
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.900]   You can still have an apple watch. You just have to turn off the geolocation services
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:41.940]   This is this is finally
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:45.700]   This comes from way back when strava and then more recently
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:48.500]   What was the app that was given away?
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:54.340]   Information about low case was this trava strava was the first one that was in january and then there was one
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.900]   last month
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.780]   It's not a good idea. Yeah, you'd think operational
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:09.860]   Obsec yeah would require that you not be doing that effective immediately defense department personnel are prohibited from using geolocation features and
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:12.980]   functionality on government and non-government issued devices
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:19.060]   applications and services while in locations designated as operational error areas
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:24.340]   So people were really blaming
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:28.580]   the apps, but I think it's probably safe to say
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:31.540]   This is a good policy
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:34.020]   I think that it was like the
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:37.460]   General saw that and just said they're doing what what
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:44.420]   They need you stop doing that
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:50.340]   Right me a memo rule that says don't wear a GP. Don't wear a tracker of all of your data
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:55.220]   positions like have you heard about a concept called road side bomb
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:46:00.340]   How would they know how would they know where to put them because you've been tracking and leaving a big map around
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:03.460]   All right gentlemen, would you please?
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:09.700]   Prepare your picks because we are going to take a break and then the the the picks of the week coming up
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:15.140]   Momentarily this episode of Mac break weekly. So let's see. I've done demos of the slide belt
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.900]   I did the demo of the nice trace point s olive oil. I think this means I need to buy a house now
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:23.540]   Buy a house. Let's just buy a house on the air
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.300]   To demonstrate how easy it is how relaxing it is
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.900]   With rocket mortgage from quick and loans quick and loans
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:35.540]   Very much spends time thinking about the the user experience the customer experience
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:42.100]   That's what's made them the best lender in the country number one in customer satisfaction according to jd power eight years running
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:44.580]   also number one in volume
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:52.100]   And now I just they want to underscore that rocket mortgage is doing more to make the experience better
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:55.620]   Lately interest rates have started to tick up in the United States and that's
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:47:00.500]   Definitely a cause for anxiety. You're out house hunting and you think to yourself
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:06.100]   Man, if I take another day interest rate could go up by a quarter point that's tens of thousands dollars over the life
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.940]   That's terrible
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:13.380]   That puts pressure on you and you don't want pressure. This is the most important purchase you'll ever make the biggest check you'll ever write
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:18.100]   So quick and loan says all right we can make this easier with the power buying process
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:22.740]   It all starts as always with rocket mortgage the entirely online mortgage approval process
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:28.740]   You answer a few simple questions. They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions with your permission
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:33.140]   They get everything they need to know and then based on your income assets and credit

[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:42.340]   And then within less than a day less than 24 hours verified approval
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:47.380]   By the way verified approvals is is the bees knees as grandpa would say
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:50.260]   It basically me says you've got the money
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:55.620]   It makes you effectively a cash buyer and in today's sellers market
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:00.580]   It's great when you're going in you're bidding against people you want to be the one who says i've already got the loan
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:02.660]   I've got verified approval
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:08.580]   Now once you're verified you qualify for the all new exclusive rate shield approval
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:14.020]   They lock your rate for up to 90 days while you shop that means you have up to three months
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:18.660]   To find the right house without any fear of the rate going up it will not it cannot
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:22.020]   Go up even if rates are going up your rate stays the same
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:25.940]   And everybody only when I say that they say well what if they go down
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.180]   Yeah, they go down and then your rate goes down
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:30.180]   Either way you win
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.660]   They just won't raise the rate they will lower it. They will not raise it
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:37.540]   It's the kind of thinking you expect from america's largest mortgage lender take the anxiety

[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:33.780]   For making mac break weekly possible. Alex lindsey. Let's get your pick of the week
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.820]   So I
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:39.860]   Had like a little odyssey this this weekend trying to figure out how to get
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.580]   Illustrator how to create my own shapes and keynote
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:43.380]   So
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:49.140]   What I wanted to do is is actually you know keynote's got a lot of great shapes that it comes with but I want to put my logo in there
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:51.540]   And I want to put other things in there so that when i'm building keynote docs
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:55.140]   I can just drag them in and you can have my shapes
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:56.500]   You can take a shape
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.620]   And then edit it and then put it back in and it'll show up at the bottom under my shapes
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:03.380]   So I wish you could reorder that but look that's a whole nother story. So
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:07.540]   The key was how do I get my logo into keynote? So it's there all the time
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:10.100]   I don't have to figure out where to import it or how to how to use it
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:16.260]   And then it became how do I bring in all these icons that I want to use all the time for the kind of keynotes that I build
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:18.740]   So there's a turns out it's not simple
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.420]   You you if you take a
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:25.700]   An illustrator file and you just cut and paste it, you know an eps file or pdf and cut and paste it into into keynote
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.020]   It doesn't know what to do with that. Um
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:32.580]   And so I mean it does it'll show up, but you can't go into like
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:35.140]   You can't go in and say make this a shape
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:38.180]   What you need to do is convert it to a keynote doc
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:43.060]   And so there is a there's a geeky little app or a geeky little website
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:47.940]   It is a christian Holtz who's probably going to be surprised by the amount of people going to
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:52.820]   He's got what happened so all these people are downloading my utility
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.020]   What whatever to the server? So
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:51:01.300]   It's very geeky you you go into uh, there's an ai to key
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:08.340]   Dot o 4 to uh at create for a creative cloud or some of the other ones creative cloud 2018
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:16.420]   By the way, his instructions are wrong. You actually have to go into the illustrator folder in your apps not into your app support and library
[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:21.300]   But you go into illustrator and then there's a plugin document and then you drag this into the plugin document
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:26.260]   And then you restart illustrator. Then when you go to export one of your export options is keynote
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:28.820]   Oh, and so you can bring in how cool is that?
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:34.260]   Illustrator, that's nice. Yeah, you can bring in an illustrator file and then you export it out as a keynote document and then you can open it in keynote
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:41.700]   It's a little buggy. It's a poorly written keynote document, but it'll stay open long enough for you to you know, like drag it up
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:46.900]   Or you just you just select it and um if there's it'll come if you don't
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:51.940]   If you grab something that hasn't been um and it can't be grooved. It needs to be
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:55.620]   United so you have to take the illustrator file
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:59.140]   In then you select all the items that you want you go under
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:04.980]   There's a place in keynote in the same part, you know when you're where you can do intersect or you night
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:09.380]   You have to use unite which is kind of a bullying of all of them turns them all into one object
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:14.980]   Um, so you turn that into one object and then you go into shapes and you um and you say make this a shape
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:17.620]   um and uh anyway, so
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:20.340]   uh that is the
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:24.340]   And i've added over the weekend i added like 50 or 60 of them in there and it it works really well
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:29.060]   Um, and you can like just collect all of the things that you want to put in what i did
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:32.980]   Is i just built a whole page of all the icons that i that i use a lot that are all eps
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.540]   And i just threw them all together and you um
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:43.220]   And just saved it all out as one keynote document then i just selected each one hit unite and then um, it's under and it's under
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:46.020]   it's in like a weird, you know, uh, uh,
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:49.540]   It's in a weird place, um, but it's uh, um
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.180]   under format and
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:55.700]   Under shapes and lines you can unite shapes and then you can make them
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.180]   um there anyway, so, uh,
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:05.620]   If you have ever wondered how to get these cool icons into your keynote documents so that you can use them and they're just there
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:10.820]   Every time you use your computer. Um, that's how you do it. And it's the only way i've found to do it
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:13.460]   And it's free, right?
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:19.140]   It is uh, it is free. It's just you just download it off your off that off that website. I just like to thank him
[01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:24.340]   Uh, I it was so useful over the weekend. I was like, I gotta make this the pick because it was it saved me
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:28.420]   You know, I just couldn't figure out any other way to do it and I will say that it is a little
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:31.060]   Bit of a bummer that apple doesn't just
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:36.580]   Yeah, import it just so that you can make it a shape but but I couldn't get the uh, if I took a regular
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:40.660]   You know, uh a i for a eps file or whatever and drag then it'll show up fine
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.300]   It'll export fine out of keynote, but you can't turn it into a shape which means you can't put it
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:48.180]   You know into the uh into the library
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:50.180]   Do you know who this guy is?
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.180]   Christian, I have no idea that there is
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:56.580]   No, he is a researcher in human computer interaction at microsoft research
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.860]   Interesting he works for microsoft
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:06.740]   But he is uh, he's in zorick and he's going to be teaching at uh, eth zorick as an assistant professor of computer science
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:11.140]   So it's christian holds h o l z dot net
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:15.380]   Christian holds dot net and then he's got a lot of little projects in here
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:21.700]   You probably could just search for keynote ai to keynote or something like that and find yeah
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:25.620]   I just did illustrator to keynote is what I yeah is all you yeah
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:29.220]   Yeah keynote utilities. Yeah, the name of it is ai
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:31.860]   number two ke y
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.300]   And he also has one from svgs to keynote
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:38.580]   Yeah, I didn't find that one as useful. Yeah
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:43.780]   That's awesome. But I but I yeah that works for microsoft. Please making it work for keynote. I love it
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:49.220]   Well, you know the secret that you know the secret that no one wants to admit
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.620]   And I am not I'm not saying that he's saying this or anything else, but yeah in the presentation world
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:58.340]   We do a lot of work for a lot of large companies that are doing uh, uh doing presentations on stage
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:04.580]   Everybody uses keynote no matter what you give because we're also sick of the powerpoint as a distinctive look and I think we're just sick of it
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:09.540]   Well, it also doesn't have its buggy. It doesn't have as many controls. It doesn't you can't use it
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:10.660]   You can't make it look just good
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:14.180]   You know keynote just makes it look better and it animates better and it works better
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:17.540]   And it it is just a much much more refined experience
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:23.780]   Um, so there's always this this hiccup someone hand you and what you don't want is someone who's really good at powerpoint because they'll put all this crazy
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:26.660]   With all the work
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:32.340]   Little picture and pictures and these little like weird little animations and they are so proud of it and you just have to go
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:33.940]   Thank you. Thank you
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.940]   And then and then you and then you just tear the whole thing apart
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:40.100]   You you take all the raw images you put it back in and then you try to figure out how to reproduce the crazy thing
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:42.420]   And then make it a little better by using you know
[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:45.380]   one of the plugins or one of the filters and and so um
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:48.340]   But I don't know anybody I
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:51.540]   Uh, do you know do you see people using prezi anybody?
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:59.140]   Because I used prezi for PR easy I for a long time. It's not a lot of people a lot of people use prezi for
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:00.900]   um, you know for
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:05.060]   Person to person or in a meeting or whatever we've seen that but i'm talking about people on stage
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:10.660]   Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't want to use it on stage. It makes people seasick if you use it on stage. I know when when i've done it
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:15.700]   Yeah, when teams when teams work on when you when you hand it off to a presentation team
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:21.460]   They're all keynote folks, you know, like they're not right. I mean I haven't run into too many that that aren't that aren't keynote folks, right?
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:28.100]   If I did more presentations that probably get better at it, but I've decided not to do any more presentation
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:31.780]   So I have uh kind of an odd pick for you. It's a website
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:36.100]   I found this on hacker news today and I couldn't stop reading it
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:42.820]   It's the pudding at putting dot cool. Okay, putting dot cool
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:49.060]   Uh their tagline the pudding explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:55.860]   And i'll tell you the first one I saw and there's a whole bunch of them in here was uh Hamilton lyrics
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:01.700]   Uh, yeah, you'll like that, but there's even more uh, there's all sorts of stuff in here
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:10.420]   Uh including, um, I know you guys will be interested in analyzing the gender representation of 34,476 comic book characters
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:16.500]   Um hollywood's gender divide and interactive visual. This is the one I want. Let me just show you this
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:22.340]   It's beautiful in an interactive visualization of every line in hamilton by surely wu
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:26.980]   So, uh if you scroll down it's it's
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:31.700]   Just it's about big data and and and learning
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:38.980]   Uh, like for instance in here every circle is a set of lines colored by the singer and then you see the lyrics
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:41.460]   and the
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.460]   But then there's more down here
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:49.140]   Uh filtering them out by who says what who sings what? It's fascinating
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:52.340]   It's great. This is big data
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:55.380]   in useful and
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:57.380]   interesting and very engaging
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:00.420]   Way of looking at popular culture a lot of it
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:06.500]   So, uh if you're a hamilton fan that's certainly a great place to start but go to putting dot cool
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.300]   I mean here's words that rappers love
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:13.620]   What city is the microbrew capital of the united states
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:18.820]   And they're beautiful. I mean talk. I know this is not keynote. I don't know what they're by the way
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:21.300]   Did you know that the microbrew capital of the united states is?
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:24.020]   Santa rosa
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.220]   Which is about a little
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:31.220]   15 minutes north was well. I think they're including petaluma in the san erosa. It's all the same roughly same region
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:36.820]   So, uh the bigger the circle the higher the ranking you see that giant circle there
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:40.980]   That's san erosa right and we're in that giant circle there
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:44.180]   The top 50 cities for beer lovers in the us
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:50.260]   I love data is so interesting and but data visualizations
[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:54.900]   Really, uh make it accessible and then fascinating
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:57.700]   So this is pudding
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:58:59.140]   in fact, uh

[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:16.580]   fascinating
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:18.820]   I thought put in is what holly called mr. J
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:22.580]   Thought putting putting dot cool
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:30.260]   Renee richy pick of the week my friend. So firstly, I want to just commend you for not buying a house on apple pay
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:32.260]   Even though I would have loved most
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:38.340]   It's so easy
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:44.500]   So my pick of the week so I've been doing a lot of youtube lately and one of the comments I keep getting is that I talked too fast
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:47.860]   And people said oh you're reading off your teleprompter too fast and I
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:52.020]   Especially when people say that i'm almost never reading off the teleprompter
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:57.620]   I'm speaking extemporaneously. I just speak really really sad. That's all it is
[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:04.100]   I am really hard at least for me. It's really hard to change the way that you speak and when I get with christina
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:09.860]   Worn on a podcast for example. It's like it's basically you don't need smart. She speaks at light light speed
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:13.940]   I I've never seen anybody talks so fast and serenity's no slouch in that either
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:20.900]   No, I so I think it so what I've been trying to do is ironically i've gone to the teleprompter in an attempt to slow it down
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:28.740]   By slowly incrementally slowing down the teleprompter so that I learned to enunciate as though I went to juliard
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:33.540]   And the app i've been using I tried a bunch of them and I ended up full disclosure going with an app made by
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:41.620]   A friend of mine. Well someone that I know in the apple developer community and i show it to plinsky and big brain big bombing brain something software
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:47.140]   Uh, and it's it's really good. So you what I end up doing is I write out something in notes
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.220]   I I paste it into this on an iphone. I put the iphone next to me
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:55.940]   I put the ipad across from me and then I use the iphone to control the ipad
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:01:00.180]   You can do it right on the ipad if you want, but I prefer to put the ipad far enough away that
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:02.900]   Um, it's not within reach anymore
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:08.660]   And then I can just on the iphone. I can control the speed I can swipe back if I miss anything or I say anything wrong
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:11.140]   And I just sit there and I do like drills
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:17.300]   One of the videos I did uh yesterday was on how you know how I get better or how I succeed at doing what I do
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:22.580]   And a lot of people just do repetition, but I've always found that conscious repetition is what's important
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:25.700]   Like every time you do something you have to pick one aspect of it
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:31.380]   You want to get better at and so this is one of the tools that i'm learning to train getting better at speaking slower
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:35.140]   Uh, and just by slowly adjusting that turtle icon
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:39.540]   I can drop it down from the middle to like 4.5 and then four
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:44.100]   And sometimes I lose it and I have to go back up a little bit because I don't want it to sound freakish
[02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:49.140]   But it's really been helping me at trying at least trying to speak a bit slower
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:53.460]   Speak exactly as fast as you want to
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:56.340]   Well, the internet will complain either way, right?
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:58.340]   You know
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:03.140]   But it's a wonderful teleprompter app all that aside. It's very useful good very nice
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:07.140]   Four score
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:12.900]   And seven I have to play with it. I I played with it in the past and it worked great. I'm always scared of wireless connections
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.740]   You know, so yeah, we have a our teleprompt, you know software is off of a mac and it goes into a teleprompter
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:24.340]   But there's always a wire and I'm always, you know afraid because we're in live. So if it yes, it's glitchy
[02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:30.900]   Important people are angry. I don't I haven't but I don't work in your environment. Oh, I hate teleprompters
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:33.220]   Um
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:37.780]   But I never replaces a great host like we go well and but yeah, that's a good point
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:43.860]   I'm using it less as a traditional teleprompter and more as a training tool to speak like William Shatner
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:48.500]   Because Picard is always I feel like I have to give Shatner
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:51.940]   I always warn people I'm always like, you know, if unless that person has spent years
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:56.260]   Using a teleprompter. You do not want to use it. It's very hard to do as well
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:03:00.660]   It's just it's hard to do it naturally and it takes a lot of practice and people don't realize that it's this kind of
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:04.580]   It's like playing the bagpipes or you know, like uh or playing a didgeridoo
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.500]   Because you're you have to be a couple words ahead while you're talking behind it
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:13.780]   You know, which is typical voiceover, you know, a typical voiceover issue where you're looking ahead on your text
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:16.340]   Um, but you have to do that with teleprompters and people get good at it
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:22.580]   But but they take it takes practice. It's not like the first time you ever do it. It's going to work, you know, and otherwise it just sounds
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:24.420]   Very
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:28.980]   Yeah, not so good. And I just think it doesn't sound and there are reasons to do it, especially when you're
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:31.300]   Well, I think when a's got the best reason of all to do it
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:35.380]   I mean, I think it's a very good idea for things like slowing you down. I think that's a great idea
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:41.620]   And and and also just packing a lot of information that you wanted to say in a certain way if you if you need to say it exactly right
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:45.460]   Or if you just want bullet points in front of you to remember your talking points
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:52.180]   I used to I mean we had teleprompters in this old screensavers and I found I just found out the other day that I actually had a comedy writer that
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:58.100]   I just never that would put jokes in the teleprompter, but I would never use them because I never looked at the thing
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.060]   I hate it. I'm Leo the poor
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:12.100]   Uh, Alex lens a did his pick. I already chose. It's a it's any not coast turn. Sorry, Andy your turn. Hello. Hello
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:15.300]   Nothing mac or ios
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:20.180]   Related is exciting me as much as Dan slots long-awaited
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:24.580]   Restart of the fantastic four comic book series with marvel
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:30.020]   This is a hysterically funny story that because
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:33.060]   Fantastic Four was one of like the two major properties
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:38.420]   Between that and x-men that marvel movie studios did not have the rights to
[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:47.860]   The ceo decided that guess what we're gonna cancel the why are we promoting the fantastic four by having licensing deals and dolls and comic books
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:54.740]   We're you're not you're you got to cancel a fantastic four and so there's been no fantastic four book for the first time since 1963
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:05:02.660]   So it's not just the return of this team. It's also Dan slot. She he's on that short list of writers for me
[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:08.500]   Where if he's writing it, I'm definitely going to take a look at it. It's got to be at minimum interesting
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:14.420]   Even when there's even when I know that I've had the story described to me
[02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:21.060]   And I know that's not the sort of story that I like I will still read it and even if I still don't like the idea of
[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:28.100]   People going to heaven to try to bring back someone who died. I still think that's a bad idea for a story
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:30.340]   But I will still enjoy
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:32.420]   The way that this writer happened to have written it
[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:36.740]   So so it's not only a great writer and a classic team
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:43.700]   But also by it's very nature going to be a really good jumping on point for people who have been wanting to just try something
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:51.620]   Maybe they stopped reading comics as recent as a couple of years ago because it's just impossible to know what's going on because things cross over
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:54.100]   Everywhere including into the movies and back
[02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:57.940]   It's I think this is going to be well worth your time and effort
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:06:02.260]   And you can just download it off of you can buy it on amazon. You can buy it on comicsology
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:06.420]   Download the comicsology app and read it digitally on your iPad or on your desktop
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:08.340]   And so that's my pick of the week
[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:14.180]   But if you really love comics, you should buy it put it in a plastic bag barrier in the backyard for 100 years and you'll be rich
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:20.900]   Not before you get Dan slot to please take this metal Sharpie
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:27.140]   Yes and sign over the indica. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's really valuable
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:32.740]   Said is somebody whose entire comic book collection was thrown out by his mother in the 80s
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:37.540]   Oh, that's fine. She's so sweet. I have mine. I don't know what to do with it
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:41.460]   It's just boxes and boxes in my storage room. I wasn't exactly taking good care of it
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:45.380]   And then my god kids came over and they were just very quiet
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:48.420]   I went and looked and they had all the original black suit spider-man
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:52.180]   Like spider-man 252 and up opened out of their bags reading them. I had a little heart attack
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:57.780]   And then enjoy you know what I like to do. I like to buy the bound
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:04.180]   Sets of stuff. Yes. I I have I was just thinking about it. I haven't looked at in ages
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:06.900]   uh the Neil Gaiman um
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:12.260]   Series. Yeah, I just gave that to my god's on the hard mouth. Yeah, absolutely. It's they're gorgeous. They're gorgeous
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:18.340]   What a great gift see that's a that's a problem when I put all my books back on shelves after I moved
[02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:23.940]   I realized the problem that like now whenever I buy a reference book or like a novel or something
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:31.060]   I'm buying it on the Kindle the only things that I'm regularly buying in hardcover are like comic book anthologies and the complete
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:36.820]   Peanuts and so the thing is if someone comes to visit my house. They say oh look he's a reader. He has lots of oh
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:42.980]   All he reads are like comic books and picture books and it's not a high functioning man. Is he like no?
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:47.860]   Look at my Kindle. Look at my Kindle. I got like all up-dike and I got like all this stuff from google books
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:51.140]   published on the 1700s look I've got hidden tapes, baby
[02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:58.020]   This is the sand sand man. I'm talking about it's the absolute sand man and it's in several volumes
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:04.820]   And it was very expensive, but boy is it nice to have I guess it's not uh, it's at a print you have to buy it use now
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.900]   But uh, it's just just gorgeous
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.900]   Yeah
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:13.380]   I love I love Neil Gaiman and sense why I bought that and then I bought Calvin and Hobbes in the same way
[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:17.860]   And I did too. Oh, it's so great. Isn't that nice the complete Calvin and Hobbes is so awesome
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:23.540]   And then uh, and so the same reason Andy for hand me downs. I bought the lord of the rings
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:29.060]   And the hobbit in that nice leather bound set that whoever is publishing now just so I have that
[02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:34.340]   You know, it's just there's certain things you want to have physical copies of so you can I got the dark
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:37.060]   I returned in the watchman as well same thing right
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:43.060]   Yep, I did I did I did one can one more edit of like my my hardcover like book collection
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:48.660]   And of course my original as a teenager copies of hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:52.820]   And the restaurant in the universe and all of those like had to make the final cut because
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:55.460]   I've got those and like so many editions on my kindle
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:57.540]   But I love the little part
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:03.460]   I want the book that I had like flat on the floor of my bedroom as I lay based on on my bed with my head
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:10.260]   Hanging over the edge of the bed reading this entire book in one sitting as soon as I got home from the store to buy it
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.660]   That's nice. That's what makes a comic book fan
