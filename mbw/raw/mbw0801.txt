[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.800]   wants to do, which means it's time to talk about the latest
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.240]   news from Apple with Renee Ritchie of YouTube fame.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.800]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie, Forbes Magazine,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.120]   top 50,000 money makers on YouTube or something.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120]   I don't even know if I'm top 50,000.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.760]   You got to-- I don't know those lists.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.640]   They're so funny anyway.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400]   It's like if the Rock makes one YouTube video,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.800]   is he the highest paid YouTuber?
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.120]   Because he made a-- it's all just--
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.760]   I think they're probably right, Mr. Beast, probably is number one.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.120]   Right?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.320]   He's in there.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.040]   He's a beast.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.560]   He's a beast.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.440]   Yeah, he does all right.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.400]   That's Alex Lainsey.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.920]   He knows a little bit about monetizing the stream,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.480]   except Office Hours is free.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.800]   But anyway, Office Hours.Global, 090.media.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.840]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.440]   We help people monetize their stream,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.000]   where we produce streams that are worth monetizing.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.880]   Oh, and I know we mostly just talk about it.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.800]   Yeah, it's free.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   Also, I was just talking about it.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.320]   Nothing but also with us Andy and Akko from WGBH,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.880]   who is soon going to monetize his PES dispenser
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   collection.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.400]   Oh, thank god.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.920]   I should point out that I'm the person who pivoted from print
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   newspaper writing to terrestrial radio.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   Please don't take my buy song money or anything.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   I've done this dumb thing, which is, ooh, that looks like a good way
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.600]   to spend the day.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.400]   This looks like this will be challenging and interesting.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.720]   I should have-- but when I should have had the conversation
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.680]   with myself at 23 saying, yeah, but maybe you
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   want to have a real estate license in addition to that,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.040]   because they don't give you a lot of money for doing things
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.360]   you love.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   I just got an email from my boss at the radio syndicator
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.320]   premiere saying, congratulations on 15 years
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.280]   and syndication.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.880]   Wow.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.280]   I went--
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.080]   I phone hold.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.240]   What?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.400]   And then-- but I wrote back.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.280]   I said, actually, last month was my 45th year in broadcasting.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   So wow, that's a long time.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.040]   I remember when I first started thinking,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.840]   I'll never get to five years of experience.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.080]   How am I going to get these jobs?
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.120]   They all say three to five years of experience required.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.760]   Was radio black and white back then, Leon?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.240]   Yeah, it was.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.760]   It was amazing.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.280]   Am I really not correct?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.240]   And those were the days.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.840]   No, actually, it was all--
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.400]   [SINGING]
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.880]   It was a lot.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.640]   I had about two years in.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.240]   I thought I was going to do it for the rest of my life,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.840]   and that was it.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Yeah, you were smart.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.200]   It took me a while to figure it out.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.760]   I got fired.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   That's how I got out of it.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.600]   I got fired.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.880]   No, you were smart, because we were talking about this
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.640]   in the club twit discord the other day.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.680]   What's fun as a hobby turns out to be horrible
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.600]   is a job.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.120]   And I thought college radio, I love this.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000]   I get to play the music I love.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.600]   OK, make great segues, talk to the people.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.840]   Then I got a real job, and it's like, play this,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.000]   push a button, no more than 20 words, read the weather.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.320]   And it's like, that's assembly line work.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.240]   That's not--
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.920]   But I got to say, I would like to be negotiating
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.280]   on closing the cell on my fourth vacation home right now.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.640]   But there's something to be said for being
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.280]   like deep, deep, deep into middle age and still thinking
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.640]   that, wow, I can't wait to--
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   I can't wait to--
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   I'm so enjoying doing this podcast, month of podcast,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   and I can't wait.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.960]   I'll say, I can't wait to go do this next thing
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   that I got to do, because if I had become an attorney
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   or an accountant, it would have been--
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.280]   It would have been a great 10 years.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   Those 10 years have been great.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.680]   I would have had so much stuff during those 10 years.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.280]   But then I would be one of those guys who's like,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.040]   you know what, maybe living in a camper van
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.440]   and having no fixed address for the rest of my life
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.840]   I think at 43 that's what I want to do.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.440]   I don't-- I don't like people.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.240]   I don't like procedures anymore.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.040]   I don't like--
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.440]   That's the wrong way to stand by the river.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.840]   Nothing wrong with it.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.960]   You know, me in a jock, I don't think I could have done
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.840]   forever, but I was as a music director.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.040]   It was kind of the life.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.440]   Like a music director for--
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.440]   In those days.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   In those days.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   In those--
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.840]   In those old days, a music director for an R&R parallel
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.040]   was like a good time, especially when you're 21 years old.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   It was--
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   It was--
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   It was great.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.440]   Yeah, but every night.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   It was really bad for my liver.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   So it was--
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   Yeah, but it was--
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   But I did imagine, I did project out forward looking at everyone
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   around me going, probably going to have a, you know,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   a 30-year-old van by the river.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   I know a lot of people.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   You're never going to make anybody.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   That's exactly what you do.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   But you can't-- it's hard to give up.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   You're hanging out with the band.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   You love it.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   It's fun.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   You know, it's a good life.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.440]   No, thank God I found podcasting and changing--
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   Yeah, yeah, I turned it over.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   Yeah, I turned it over.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   I know so many people in radio still Hawaii.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   They just laid off pretty much all of the best known
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   Hawaiian radio people just all got fired.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   Right.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   And it's like 30 years, you know, nothing.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   What do you got to show for it?
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   Nothing.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   That's why part of this component is if you can work for yourself
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   and do the thing that you love, that's better than, oh boy,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   if I get fired from this job, I'm totally screwed.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   It's like my--
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   I think all of us have like parts of the story, which is like,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   my God, oh no, this newspaper folder, oh no, they stop doing
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   this show.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   It's like, if I lose six more jobs, I could be in real trouble.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.440]   No, in fact, every one of us has a freelance career.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   I guess, Alex, you work for somebody, but you know, I think
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   you're still pretty much your own boss.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   Yeah, I'm kind of left to my own devices.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440]   One is like, keep generating revenue.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   Exactly.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   Exactly.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   And you've started many a business and we're all kind of--
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   Yeah, well, it's--
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   You know, there was some point where we were in Vegas and a bunch
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   of us were having dinner and all of us had started companies.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   And they were all about the same size.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   All had about 30 employees or so.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.440]   And we were talking about it.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   And we realized that none of us had gone to college and finished
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.440]   college.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   And we'd all started college and we'd finished it.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.440]   And we were wondering what the connection was.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   And someone brought up that it was like, well, when you don't have a
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.440]   college degree, there's a little voice in the back of your head
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   that always says, the next job after this is McDonald's.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   That's funny.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   Exactly.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   That voice in my head.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   Keep your movement.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.440]   Hey, it's not really an Apple story, but boy, what a big story.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   Broke this morning.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.440]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   We're all talking about it this morning.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.440]   Microsoft buying Blizzard, Activision Blizzard, for a massive
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.440]   amount of money.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   Of course, this is a company that's been very troubled by
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.440]   accusations of harassment, misogyny, mistreatment of women,
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   of frack culture.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   But they also make some of the biggest games in the world.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   And Microsoft--
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   Is that Microsoft?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   Is that Microsoft?
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   Was that the amount?
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   70 and 70 Instagrams, something like that.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   I'm worth every penny.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.440]   I mean, it was incredible.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.440]   68 Instagrams, I think, directly.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   68 billion dollars.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   Oh, look at what-- like, who decided it was 68 instead of 70?
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   That's the one-- like, how did they negotiate that down?
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   Someone said 75, someone said 63, and they were like, about 70.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   I'm a champion, I'm metal.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   Or is it New York Times says nearly 70 billion.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440]   It's funny.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   $0.7 billion is like, eh, that's a small--
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   Nearly 70 billion dollars, billion here, billion there.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   Pretty much it adds up.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   I do think it's an Apple story in the sense that Apple's going to have to get more serious
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   about how they view games.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.440]   I mean, they already pay a lot of attention to games, but Microsoft now has made a big move.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.440]   I mean, they already have Xbox.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   They have Minecraft.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.440]   They have-- you know, they have a lot of air at Halo, right, exactly.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   So there's a lot of things that they already have, and it really puts them in a really
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   interesting position, I think, in a better position than the folks that are ahead of them.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   You know, there's a-- you know, they have Sony and others that are a little ahead of them
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.440]   in the game area, but I think that-- but the rest of Microsoft's infrastructure, you know,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   from Azure and everything else really puts them in a really-- a pole position to do some
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   really interesting things, especially as it pertains to the metaverse.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   And remember that one of the companies that Steve Jobs absolutely admired and really kind of
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   wanted to emulate in the early days was Sony, because he loved their-- how they were telling
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   his story through their products, their products were really well designed.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   And of course, one of the pivoting-- the biggest pivoting moments of Sony was when they said,
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   "Hey, you know what, we're having problems with people with--
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   with brown-beating record companies and supporting our compact disc format and our
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   debt format and all those other formats.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   You know what, let's just open the checkbooks.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   Let's just buy CBS Records, have our-- have become our own music company, exactly, and
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   just keep buying these companies so to do-- not because not only will it be great for our
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   hardware line, it'll be great for just-- just for our bottom line.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   And so, Apple-- this is-- I know that Alex, you talked a little bit about, "Gee, maybe
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   Apple should try to buy Disney or something."
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.440]   It makes-- it makes a lot of sense on that basis where workers control the means of production,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.440]   but when big corporations also control the means of creative output, yeah, that's a good
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   place to be.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   As an employee of Epic Records when that happened, or as a-- you know, it was the best because
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   you got 60% off all the Sony gear and you could buy it for your friends.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   We said, "Can I buy it?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   How much can I buy it for my friends?"
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   And they were like, "Oh, yeah, you can buy it for your friends."
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   And I was like, "Why?
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440]   Why are we allowed to buy it for our friends?"
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   And they said, "They just don't sell it somewhere, but you can buy it for people and give it to them."
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   And they can pay you for it and everything else.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   And I was like, "Why?"
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   And they're like, "Influence?"
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   And everybody wants to be friends with a Sony employee because they can get them everything
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   off at 60% off.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   Or a hybrid control brain.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   Yeah, but that-- and it made a huge difference.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   Yeah, it worked a bit.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   It worked a bit.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   Sorry.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440]   I'm sorry, I'm 10 years old.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   I will shut up.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   Yeah, but it was-- you know, the Sony-- it broke all kinds of things for Sony, you know, to go
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   into that area to be specific.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.440]   But I think that, you know, there's a-- I mean, we talked about an office hours this morning,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   there are just a myriad of potential possibilities of what Microsoft can do with this.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   It's going to really give them some-- it's going to be really interesting.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   It's a great-- it's a great-- it's a great purchase of both of them.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.440]   It's really made-- it's really made-- it's a great purchase.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   It's a great purchase of both of them.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   It's a great-- it's a great purchase of both of them.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   It's turned them into the largest gaming company in the world.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   They bought-- as you mentioned, they bought MoJang Minecraft.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   They bought ZeniMax, which owns Bethesda.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   So that's id software.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   They own now some of the biggest franchises in gaming, Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   World of Warcraft.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.440]   And let's not forget Candy Crush.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   Because King is also part of that deal.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   So it really-- it's interesting.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   I think one of the things that makes this possible is the fact that all the antitrust
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   scrutiny right now is at Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   Nobody-- notice Microsoft's-- they haven't-- they haven't have to show up, right?
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   They didn't even go to Washington and testify.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.440]   So I think that there-- because obviously at this point, there's such a big dominant
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   aggregator of gaming companies.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   I think there should be regulatory over this.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.440]   I think it sounds like there might be--
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   There's like a two-year window, and it seems like the new legislation that they're
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   drafting is specifically targeted for these kinds of mergers and acquisitions.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440]   Get it done now.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   And we'll hear you at this right now.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   No, no, I think they didn't get it done soon enough.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   It sounds like they're going to fall right in this sweet spot of this stuff ramping up.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   And I think that what will be interesting is to see what happens to 2K games, to a lot
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   of other--
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   Tencent.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   I mean, all of the-- well, Tencent because it's Chinese probably won't go anywhere, but
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   the-- I mean, as far as-- it'll go somewhere as a huge company.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   Well, that's why there needs to be regulation, because it does make it hard for everybody
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   else now, especially since Microsoft not only has all these studios, they have the
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   Xbox.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   In fact, if I were Sony, I'd be complaining like crazy, because Microsoft says, "Oh,
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.440]   we're not going to make these exclusive."
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   Yeah, sure.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   So at some point--
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   Today, Leo.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   Yeah, not today.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   So at some point, PlayStation is going to really be challenged by this.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   Well, the question really is, as you look forward towards-- we spent all of yesterday
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   with an NFT expert, and once you start thinking about it, you're like, "Oh, okay.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   I'll start--" Like, after-- off his hours yesterday was all NFT.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   And when you think about it, there's a point where you start moving potentially from selling
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   the game to giving the game away so that you can man it, you can take a piece off of all
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   the commerce.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440]   Well, that's kind of happened--
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   It's not the game.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   I mean, that's--
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   Yeah, I mean, that's--
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   Right, but that's--
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   Maybe make that more of an even scamier situation, but I don't think--
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440]   It potentially could.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.440]   I'm just saying that-- but what I'm saying is the exclusivity may not be what they're
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   looking for.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   I mean, you know, at this point, the numbers could be so much bigger if they are-- if they
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   are--
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   I'm just--
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   I'm thinking the regular--
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   It was really good--
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   Regulatory problems are going to--
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   Absolutely.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   There was a really good tweet from Ashley Escheda, where she said Microsoft just wants to be
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   the Netflix-- the games before Netflix is in Netflix, the games.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   Yeah, well, Netflix is already hiring.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   It's a game pass.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.040]   Yeah, I would be surprised if Netflix doesn't buy one or two game companies in relatively
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.140]   short order-- I mean, the next year or so, because they're already hiring staff for it.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.440]   You know, they're hiring up-- I mean, that's public.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.640]   I mean, you can see it on LinkedIn or whatever.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.880]   So they're hiring people to manage games.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.280]   So Netflix is definitely coming down that path.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   So I think that exasperates me so much is that Apple-- like all this is going on, everyone
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   is looking at this.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.560]   And Apple is basically still treating games like discs on its shelves.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.000]   They're not even letting game pass onto the app store the way that they let Netflix and
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Disney+ onto the app store.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And it just--
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Where does Apple go?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Where does Apple go?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.760]   They-- I mean, honestly, none of these games-- these are AAA games are appearing even on
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.920]   the Mac, really.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.800]   It's PC and console gaming.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   No, maybe they'll--
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.520]   Apple, they're money off IAPs and casual games.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.560]   Yeah, Apple owns casual gaming.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   Does this maybe in a way--
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.560]   Big market.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.040]   It's maybe better for Apple because let those guys fight out.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.680]   If they let game pass on, it would be so good for Apple.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.920]   Like, they just became the platform where we take whatever 8 to 15% of every transaction--
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   Right.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.920]   This is Microsoft.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   All you can eat gaming--
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.920]   I'm not knowing them on the platform.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.920]   --gaming platform.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.560]   And in fact, one of the stories of this week is that Fortnite is back on the iPhone, but
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.680]   through the back door in the browser, thanks to Nvidia's GeForce Now.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.040]   So that's going to be a problem for Apple.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   You know?
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.000]   Can you imagine if they said Netflix and Disney+ have to put each individual title in the
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   iTunes store?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   They did say.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And actually, we have a Netflix.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   That's like they wanted, right?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   They wanted every move.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They wanted those games.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   But yeah.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Every book--
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Every book in hindsight as this is forward thinking.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.360]   I kind of want, actually, as a podcast network to have individual apps for each show.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   Like we should have a Mac--
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   Don't say it, Leo.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   They'll do it so fast.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   You make it so fast.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   It's pretty easy to do.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.080]   I'm actually kind of thinking about doing that one of her show.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   Because you know why?
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.760]   What you really want, if you're an app developer, you want to be an icon on the screen.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   Real estate.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   You want real estate.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.200]   The company that's really done that really well is Vimeo.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.960]   So Vimeo has an entire OTT.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.000]   They'll build the app for you.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.840]   So then you can put the content in, you can manage subscriptions, advertising, all that
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   stuff through it.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.520]   And they'll build it across-- you just tell it what platform you want, and you can build
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.720]   it across all of them.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.560]   And it's so much less expensive than building it.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   I used to think I was like--
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   All the players do that.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.680]   We are JDK player we used as that.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   Everybody.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.680]   So does Cash Flies player.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   That's the idea, right?
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.560]   You white label it and put it everywhere.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.200]   Then Apple occasionally bans those for being not useful apps because they're just web wrappers
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   around content.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.680]   And you go back to the big--
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.720]   Vimeo is a native app that is built for you that is using their infrastructure to do that.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.480]   It's not a web app or something like that.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:25.080]   Also, that's where Google is trying to go after their typical-- we have a master plan
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   for gaming.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   We're calling it Stadeaion.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.480]   It's got a plan that's next five years, 10 years, 20 years.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.120]   And then of course, three months later, they changed all their plans.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.000]   And now they're basically sold-- gotten rid of all their studios, and they're turning
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.880]   themselves into a white label gaming service for people who, again, if you want to do it
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.240]   if Domino's wants to do a new version of the Noid game, they'll be able to wrap it and
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.000]   surf-chipped as a mobile game.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.560]   But I think that a lot of people who are not young people ignore that games are not just,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.920]   hey, I'm going to put this floppy inside my Apple too.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.920]   I'm going to play Lemmings.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.160]   I'm going to play Carotica for a little while.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.040]   And then after my mom yells at me, I'm going to stop playing Carotica and I'm going to
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.120]   go back to my homework.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.520]   It really-- gaming is on the exact same level as music, exactly on the same level as TV,
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.480]   movies, maybe even a larger level.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.880]   That if you don't have-- if your device is-- if your logo is not associated with a good
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.160]   gaming experience, you may as well say, wow, it's a great iPad, but wow, movies really
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.320]   look crappy on it.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.320]   So--
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   Yeah, I mean, you think this is the step up.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.920]   Apple's making a lot of money on the casual games.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   So--
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, they're doing OK.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   They certainly are.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.960]   But they're missing a trick, this whole I think.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.760]   And I think that what all of them are missing right now is they don't really understand--
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.320]   I mean, the games right now are very popular, but they are still a small fraction compared
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.960]   to like sports.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.680]   And the reason for that is that they still build games for gamers as opposed to games
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.640]   for average spectators.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.920]   And that's where there's going to be a breakout title somewhere.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.560]   But if you look at all the sports, whether it's baseball or soccer or football or hockey
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.600]   or cricket, the entire field is visible almost the entire time.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:08.760]   And so someone's going to build much more arena-style systems that are much more visceral.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.160]   And when they do that, there's a lot of places that-- I mean, as someone who's worked in
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.720]   and out of the game industry for 20 years, there's a lot of open space that still could
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.040]   be taken, that doesn't look like anything that we're doing right now, that's really
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.680]   built for viewers.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.360]   The reason that American football does so well is because it's really great for TV.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.400]   And so that's-- and I think that we haven't seen any games like that yet.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.280]   I mean, I know Overwatch is supposed to be--
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.440]   e-sports is the next one.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.000]   I agree, e-sports is the next huge.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.200]   It's still too geeky.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.440]   You know, that's the problem with it.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   They'll figure it out.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   They'll figure it out.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.120]   If they figure it out, it's going to replace regular sports because you can do things with
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.520]   the cameras and put them in places and create adrenaline in a way that you really can't
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.840]   do in the real world.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   It's going to absolutely work.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.160]   Are we worried at all that Microsoft's not doing original IP, like Super Clippy World
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.600]   or Jeff-- or like Steve Bomber in a Smash Brothers clone?
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.320]   Are we worried about this?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.480]   Are we worried so fast?
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.120]   Are we first-person shooter with clips?
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.960]   We're supposed to imagine slippers with-- sorry, but Clippy with a machine gun.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.000]   I'm not going to get that out of my head.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Clippy runs around.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.960]   He's like the cops, but with Clippy's back and he's mad as hell.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.760]   Microsoft Office, the first-person shooter version.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.640]   I mean, there's just so much potentially--
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.520]   I wouldn't be interested in the games, but I would definitely be on YouTube looking for
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.680]   a compilation of all the cutscenes from that game.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.680]   Yes, exactly.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.800]   Hi, can I help you with anything?
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.200]   You could play a bill of games all the way along.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   Give yourself to die.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   Oh, no.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Remember the 50 hours.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   Oh, no.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   Post-nony.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.880]   See, you're trying to massacre an entire warehouse of illegal aliens.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   Would you like some help?
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   That was even darker than Bob-- Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.520]   Because he's watching the experience.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.920]   Let's take a little break before we go down that road, shall we?
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.600]   And when we come back, I want desperately.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.240]   I want you to reassure me about Apple's latest security issue.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.920]   But first, speaking of security, a word from ExpressVPN.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:20.680]   I know you've heard me talking about privacy, protecting it, security at the coffee shop.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.520]   I know you've heard me talk about watching Netflix from other countries because you've
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.280]   used up all the Netflix in the US.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.880]   That VPN can do so much for you.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.240]   But it's so important, so important.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.920]   I really want to emphasize this.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.760]   You choose the right VPN.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.440]   There are a lot of free VPN providers.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.960]   There are a lot of crappy VPN providers.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.000]   And if you choose the wrong one, you're really not improving your condition at all.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.320]   And I'll give you a couple of reasons why.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.440]   First of all, yeah, sure.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.240]   Good for privacy, your internet service provider or carrier can no longer see what you're doing
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   online.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.680]   Google doesn't know it's you because it's a different IP address.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.720]   But if that VPN provider sketch, they see it all.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.480]   So you want to make sure it's a VPN provider that respects your privacy.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.760]   ExpressVPN does, in fact, they go the extra mile to do so with their trusted server technology.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.000]   It lives in RAM.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.120]   It cannot write to drive.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.840]   It cannot log your presence.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   And it disappears when you disconnect.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.760]   There is no trace left.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.200]   A lot of cheap VPNs don't buy enough bandwidth.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.600]   You can't watch HD video.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   You could barely use them.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.360]   In fact, that's really given VPN is a bad name.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.520]   It's a VPN is fast.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.920]   It's fast.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   It keeps up.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.680]   In fact, they have now something called lightweight.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.440]   They use it's a new VPN protocol that makes speeds fast enough.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.160]   Yes, for HD video with zero buffering fast enough so that if you put ExpressVPN on your
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   router, which you can do, protect your whole house, but no one will even know they'll not
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.360]   complain.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.520]   They'll just they'll just say, well, it's, you know, somehow everything's better.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.340]   It is the other thing, of course, it says ExpressVPN a part size effect that they're
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.760]   here, affordable, less than seven bucks a month secure, private and fast.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.200]   Is there easy to use?
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.720]   Well, you know, when I first started using a VPN, I remember these days I was using it
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   to log on to the radio station.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   It was a nightmare.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.120]   You had to run a client and oh my gosh.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.520]   Now you just get the ExpressVPN app, push a button.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.520]   You connected.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   It's done.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.040]   Anybody can do it.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   Grandpa can do it.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.800]   And it's not just me saying this business inside of the verge.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.260]   Many tech journals write ExpressVPN, the number one VPN in the world.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.220]   I don't think there's any question about it.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:41.500]   Fast, they've got 160 locations in 94 countries, easy to watch video from any of those countries
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.500]   in high def.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.300]   They're because they're 160 locations.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.580]   They're close to where you are.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.260]   That also makes them faster.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.420]   And they and they do zero logging.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.260]   In fact, they have third party audits on a regular basis to prove that their privacy
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.280]   policy is what they say it is that their trusted server does what it says it does.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.420]   Protect yourself with the VPN.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.280]   The only VPN I use in trust.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.780]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.780]   Go there right now.
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.140]   You'll get three extra months free with a one year package.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.620]   That's the best deal.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.780]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.620]   We thank you so much for supporting Macbreak Weekly.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.260]   We thank you supporting Macbreak Weekly by using that address so they know you saw it here.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.980]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.060]   All right.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:35.820]   Talk me down off the cliff because it looks like according to fingerprintjs.com.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:43.300]   There is a leak in Safari that Apple knows about and says they have a patch for but haven't
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:52.220]   fixed a leak that could leak things like your Google account, places, websites you've recently
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.540]   visited, lots of information.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:00.420]   It's the index DB that leaks out and that has a lot of information in it.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.580]   Renee, is this overblown or is it a genuine issue?
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.580]   No, I mean, it's terrible.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.580]   It should be fixed.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.260]   Sounds like they have fixed that they just haven't rolled out to fix yet.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.500]   It's not like a hack, sort of like it's not like malware or anything like that.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.340]   It's a data privacy breach.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.340]   But those are terrible.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.060]   I think that a lot of ways Apple's measure eight times cut one strategy of only addressing
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.940]   these things when they're actually fixed hurts them because people assume that they're ignoring
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.940]   the problem, especially when you hear dates being thrown around like November and now
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.100]   it's January and you're like, well, where is it?
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.100]   You can go to Safari.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.100]   I'm not talking you down, Leo.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.100]   I'm just standing at the edge of the cliff.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.100]   You're not helping.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.100]   No.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.860]   We're holding on to each other at the edge of the cliff.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.700]   If you want to get scared, go to safarileaks.com.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.700]   It's been up and down.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.500]   I guess maybe there are a lot of people using it right now and probably will be down now
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   that I've mentioned it.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.860]   But safarileaks.com, yeah, Apple's blocking it, I guess.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.340]   Maybe it's the VP and I can go on my Linux box, but I can't go on my iPhone.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.340]   And of course, it means nothing.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.540]   You have to be using a WebKit browser.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.460]   It makes people angry, especially on iOS.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.620]   Because on the desktop, you can just switch to Chrome or you can switch to something else
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.540]   and not worry about it until Apple recovers.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.500]   But on iOS, Apple only allows WebKit as a rendering engine.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.460]   So even if you change to Chrome or you change to Firefox, you're still using WebKit under
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.460]   the cover.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.900]   But in other cases, that's helpful because it limits the amount of active exploit surface.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.620]   But when there's an actual active exploit, it's not helpful.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:30.100]   The reason this is kind of a big deal is because it was reported to the WebKit bug tracker
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.700]   on November 28th of last year.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.380]   And Apple still has not fixed it.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.340]   And Apple has had, unfortunately, there have been other cases where Apple has been slow
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.380]   to respond to bugs.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:48.700]   Apple did say this week yesterday that they have merged potential fixes into the WebKit
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700]   source code.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.700]   I don't know if they said.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.940]   I think people just saw that they did it.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.940]   That's right.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.940]   You can go look and see it.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.940]   That's right.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.900]   There's famous instances where fixing a bug destroys a ton of stuff.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.420]   And it's really hard to fix the bug.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.940]   Like there were Safari bugs that they had to go back four or five years to fix everything.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.300]   They take a while, but they don't communicate during that period.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.900]   So we don't know if they just didn't do it.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.900]   They ignored it.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.420]   If they did it, but it broke something else.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.820]   But they're still trying to feel like we have zero information to feel comforted or terrified
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.980]   by at this point.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:20.460]   Because WebKit is open source, you can actually go to WebKit on GitHub and see the patch.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.460]   So it has been merged in.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.940]   And download the nightlies, if you want.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.620]   I guess if you got the nightlies, you'd have that.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.780]   You would like a little bit more transparency.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:36.300]   I think that according to this fingerprint status article, a couple others I saw, I could
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.460]   be wrong, but there wasn't a whole lot of information about whether Apple was acknowledging
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.820]   this and moving on it.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:46.700]   That only until like earlier this week was there was there outside tangible evidence
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.060]   that yeah, they were they were working on this.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.260]   They were seeing this is something that they're going to have to fix.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.140]   And you just you'd like to you'd like to the person who reported to at least be able
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.580]   to say, okay, I see a red receipt on the receipt on this and a smile and a frowny face emoji.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.580]   They understand this.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.500]   They're going to be they're going to be working on this somehow.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.100]   So to be clear, it's not a hack.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.140]   It's just a leak of information from index DB.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.900]   And but it could be some, you know, for instance, your Google user ID.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.260]   So it could be stuff that could have problems.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.740]   I mean, just just being able to see what other what open window, what websites are you?
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.420]   Do you have another open windows and tabs?
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.220]   That's a big deal, even if it's just that for on multi-
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.580]   And not all websites interact with index DB, but many do.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:39.340]   A lot of the big ones do privacy mode, private mode in Safari 15 is not it does not protect
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.340]   you.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.340]   It's so.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.620]   I see most people get confused like with privacy and incognito.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.220]   And they think that it actually hides something.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.980]   All it does is it doesn't generate records.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.980]   It's not hiding anything.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.540]   It's just not generating a record of what you did.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.780]   So you're still doing all those things.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.500]   And in real time, people can still see what you're doing.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.940]   And when a site interacts with index DB database, that has nothing to do with the private
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.580]   browsing and the interaction still happens.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.020]   So you're not protected.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.580]   And yes, absolutely.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.900]   This could be a horrific bug to fix and Apple could have been working on this for three
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.900]   months.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.900]   We don't know.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.900]   Yeah, night and day, we just don't know.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.460]   And I understand why Apple doesn't like to talk about security issues because that just
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.420]   raises a, you know, awareness with the bad guys as well as with the good guys.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:30.020]   So you could, you could explain why Apple's not saying anything about this.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.020]   However, now's the time.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.020]   Step forward.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:38.780]   I mean, you need to, there's, there's nothing as disquieting as finding out that, oh, but
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.580]   a third party or the open press has mentioned that there is an open bug open exploitable
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.740]   zero day on this platform.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.300]   That was reported a year ago and nobody knows if the company responsible for fixing this
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.980]   has any clue or any care about fixing it.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.500]   Just when you're like, okay.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.500]   Thank you.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   That's it.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.100]   I've trust, I've placed my trust in the exactly the right laundry basket.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.580]   I'm, I'm very, very happy with this purchase that I made.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.660]   So there, and there are ways to communicate, at least with the security community that,
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.660]   okay, it's aware.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.660]   I'm aware of it.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.660]   We're working on it.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.860]   We're not just simply, it didn't just wind up behind someone's space heater is, and it's
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.540]   never going to be addressed.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.260]   Now it's time for the Alex Lindsey.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.940]   I told you so segment.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.900]   People is going to allow, allow dating apps in the Netherlands to use alternative payment
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.420]   systems, but there has to be in a separate app.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.620]   So now this data app, you'll download one that uses apple pay and you'll download another
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.460]   one that uses the whatever the dating app provided.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.100]   You can choose one of the other as the user.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.900]   Yeah, you'll have to choose one of the other.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.420]   So there'll be two apps competing apps.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.620]   Apple's going to allow third party has to allow third party payment systems in Korea.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.620]   They've accepted that.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.940]   I'm just curious, like why is it dating apps?
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   Like I haven't figured that out.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   I've read a bunch of articles.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.740]   I don't understand like what made dating apps separate.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.540]   They're serious about dating Alex.
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.540]   Wow, they are.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.540]   Those are.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.780]   Have you ever dated a country where you don't know?
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.300]   That's where you like you go Dutch.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.300]   Like the whole.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.580]   Oh yeah, they invented going Dutch.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.060]   That's right.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.060]   What am I thinking?
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.140]   I'm not going to go there.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:20.860]   So anyway, so yeah, it's, so anyway, I just thought I was, I just, I'm just amazed.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.740]   I was like, what, I still can't figure it out.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:28.700]   Like what is the dating app thing that makes it okay or makes it special?
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.420]   I guess it has to do with the ruling from the Netherlands.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.620]   The heart wants what the heart wants.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.620]   Exactly.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.620]   To deploy an apps to wrap with an external payment system, you have to apply for one of
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.740]   two new special entitlements.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.300]   The store kit external purchase entitlement or the store kit external link entitlement.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.740]   You have to declare what payment processor you're going to use.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.380]   Support URLs and some other information.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.060]   Apple will as of now only grant those entitlements, as you said, for dating apps in the Netherlands.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.740]   Because that's all that was required and we don't quite.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.380]   We don't understand why.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.140]   South Korea, I think it's the same everywhere.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.300]   Apple says we're going to bill you.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   Yep.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.500]   Dating apps will have to pay Apple a commission on the transactions just because you're not
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   using our store.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.700]   It doesn't let you off the hook, which I think by itself, Google's going to do that too.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.420]   By itself just means, well, then I'm not going to do it.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.140]   If I still have to pay 30 percent.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.540]   Well, they're giving, I think Google's giving 4 percent off or something like that for that
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.020]   processing.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.900]   The thing is that this is a really rich person's game.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.220]   This is not the average developer.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.100]   This is top point zero, zero one percent of developers.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   These are rich companies that want to make more money.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.940]   So they're the only ones that this is going to make sense to do these separate apps and
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.220]   everything else.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:54.020]   And so this is like baseball players striking for more money or actor striking for money.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:59.580]   It's not like the average person working at the warehouse striking for $10 more.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.460]   And I'm still being super careful with the 4 percent because they want to show that the
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.220]   transaction fee is a minimal part of what they provide.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.140]   They want to make sure that everybody, governments, regulars understand that it's the APIs, the
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.820]   platform access, the I, all of that is the value and the transaction fees are just really
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.820]   minimal.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.820]   So we'll give you a few percentage off.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.820]   Go home.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.820]   You're cute.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.820]   Right.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.740]   And it's really not a, this isn't out there to help the average developer because the average
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.340]   developer won't be affected by it at all.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:32.060]   It's not going to be, it's not there definitely, definitely not there to provide a better
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.620]   experience for the user.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.380]   Like this is rich companies putting money into politicians' pockets so that they can
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.780]   get more money.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.220]   Like this is not, you know, because the user is definitely going to have a poor experience
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.900]   for the user is going to go down.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.900]   It is empirical.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.700]   Like it is going to go down for the user for on, on at least the app app, the Mac platform
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   or Apple platform.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.620]   Well, and app and well, let's put it clear, make it clear.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.980]   Apple's doing everything they can to make it a crappy experience for users.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.980]   Yes.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.420]   Same things like you have to have two apps.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.220]   I mean, Apple's not going to facilitate this in a way.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.780]   Even if they don't, even if they don't have that face.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.780]   I mean, I know.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.780]   All you have to do is go to the app store.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.700]   All you have to do is go to the Apple TV and see what happens when an app asks you to
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.540]   go out of the Apple TV.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.780]   Now you have to go to this web page and sign up for this thing and then do this thing so
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.860]   that you can use your app that you paid for.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.540]   You know, and so the thing is that what the user wants is to be able to do it through
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.180]   the Apple store app store so that they can, I mean, the only users that benefit from opening
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.300]   all the sideloading and all the opening is porn.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.340]   So the thing is, after that, the user is better off.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.380]   Just sitting there with their little clicker and saying, "I would like to be charged for
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.380]   it.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.700]   I would like to use this to manage my subscriptions.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.940]   I can easily turn it off.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.260]   I can easily turn it on.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.620]   I can do all the things that that's the best user experience.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:54.220]   The best experience for rich companies is to have some kind of outer area that they will
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.180]   force the users eventually to use.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.380]   So you know, and that's the issue.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:07.300]   Well, a couple of quick points definitely benefits to the users because if Epic and other agencies
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:13.020]   had not been creating such a stink about mandatory percentages and only one transactioners,
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.660]   all these independent developers, they are making not a whole lot of money would be not
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.540]   would not simply said, "You know what?
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.500]   We've just spontaneously decided that it's kind of crap that we're trying to stick you
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.540]   for 30% on this low selling app.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.020]   We're going to cut those fees dramatically."
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.700]   So there was definitely a benefit to the users who are developing apps and running for
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.220]   the app store.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.580]   And secondly, of course, the big companies are doing things that are pursuing things to
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.060]   make things better for themselves.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.060]   But so is Apple.
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:46.580]   I mean, this is another one of those instances in which you can't make the case that it's
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:52.340]   a better user experience for people buying Kindle books to have to leave the Kindle app.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.340]   For do you buy comic books?
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.460]   You have to leave the comic solids you have.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:01.260]   And it's not because Amazon as the owners of both those entities are being mean stinkers
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.380]   who are trying to make an end run against Apple's completely true, completely fair fee structure.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.780]   It's that there is no there is very, very little trending towards no rational explanation
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.500]   for why Apple thinks that they should have a cut off of book sales inside these in app
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.100]   purchases because they had really nothing to do with with helping this person to buy
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.900]   a Kindle book or a comic book.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.140]   Other than making a platform that makes it viable?
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.900]   The platform that makes it viable is the Kindle app and the Kindle book reader.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.380]   The iPhone is negligible has a negligible influence on this.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.380]   Any phone, any device can sell a Kindle app.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.940]   Can sell a Kindle app, can sell a book that way.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.540]   But again, you've got a $50 Kindle fire tablet.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.020]   Yes, it's heavily subsidized.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.660]   Let's call it a $100 color tablet and they and they and that can still run read comic
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.860]   books very, very well.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:00.140]   This is the argument that I think is one of the weak parts of Apple's argument saying
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.340]   that, "Oh, we've created this infrastructure and this API and this blah, blah, blah."
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.020]   It's that's completely significant as luck would have it.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.220]   I'm wearing my vintage code warrior shirt.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   This is the-
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.220]   Oh, I remember it.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.220]   I remember it.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   Yeah, almost every-
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   Think, right?
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.220]   No.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.220]   Think?
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.220]   Think.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.220]   Think was Think Pascal.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.060]   See the children, there used to be a lot of different development platforms for the
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.100]   Mac before Apple decided that now we're not going to run a big thing like that.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:33.340]   We can't force our developers to do exactly what we want them to do unless we also force
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.220]   them to use the same platform.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.220]   But Metro works.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.220]   That's who it was.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.220]   Metro works.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.740]   But the basic point is that yes, that is true and that would be true when you're talking
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:51.300]   about a sophisticated app, like a really, really intense productivity app, a game, a to-do
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.780]   list, spreadsheets, things like that.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:59.300]   When really, you can create a Kindle app that is just take the website, put that in a wrapper,
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.140]   upload it, boom, you're done.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.940]   That is not something that Apple's APIs helped to bring into creation.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.900]   So this is why that argument just absolutely fails for it.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.020]   I'm going to truncate this conversation because we have it every freaking week.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020]   So-
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.540]   I'm just going to go, what I want to say is, except that they built the market, like,
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.540]   I don't want to buy a Kindle app.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.540]   I want it to run on my phone.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.540]   Okay.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.540]   We're moving on.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.540]   We're moving on.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.260]   It's quite a big debate, actually, on Thursday because this will go now before the Judiciary
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   Committee.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.300]   This is a bill introduced last year, the Open Apps.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   The Open App Markets Act by Dick Blumenthal and Marcia Blackburn, which would establish
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.060]   basically competitive rules for app stores.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:42.700]   They've announced that that's going to go in front of the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.500]   It does have bipartisan support, but I don't know how.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.820]   I hope it passes.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.820]   Be interesting to see.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.140]   Blumenthal says the bill aims to stop Apple and Google from crushing competitors and undercutting
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:59.380]   consumers, breaking the ironclad grip of these two behemoths on the multi-billion dollar
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.620]   app market is long overdue.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.620]   So it'll be very interesting to see what happens.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.220]   Does that mean I'll get WebOS back?
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.460]   Speaking of WebOS, MetroWorks came out of Hudson, Quebec.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.940]   Did you know that, really?
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.780]   Greg Galano, I just assumed that we had no more companies left.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:22.140]   In 1985, he created it.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.420]   I used MetroWorks.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.420]   It was an incredible Code Warriors, was incredible developer tool.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:32.740]   It came out May '94 at WWDC.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:39.700]   MetroWorks received credit for helping Apple succeed in its risky transition to a new processor.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   Which one was that?
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.340]   '94 must have been Intel, right?
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.580]   I can't remember.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.580]   Or was it PowerPC?
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.580]   PowerPC, wow.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.580]   From the Motorola's, you can see it,000.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   It's a tiger.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.580]   Family.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.980]   It was a PowerPC compiler, targeted PowerPC.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.100]   But now here's the sad story, Renee.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:05.060]   It was in 1999 acquired by Motorola 2005, spun off as part of Freescale.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.740]   Freescale semiconductor absorbed into NXP.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.540]   They currently- Okay.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.540]   Okay.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.540]   I'm following.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.860]   They currently own Code Warrior.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.020]   Andy owns a T-shirt, and that's what really counts.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.100]   See, a T-shirt like an NFT, does that give Andy a guess?
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.100]   Yes.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.100]   He has roots.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.420]   I will give you kids another history lesson.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.780]   There was a time when you got a T-shirt from like, whether it's a comic book or a creator
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.100]   that you like or a web comic or a mobile platform.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.340]   It was high quality stuff that you could wash and wear for like a decade or more.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.100]   It wasn't the sort of thing where you open it up, you feel the material left of this
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.820]   thing you paid $30 for and think, "Okay, I'm going to have to plot out the two.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.260]   Two times I'm going to be able to wear this before completely disintegrates."
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.860]   From Wikis Media.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.740]   Here is the MetroWorks logo circa 2001.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.740]   On it.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.740]   It's called.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.740]   On it.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.220]   You know, I like that image.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.220]   I'm using that somewhere.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.220]   I don't know where.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.220]   I love that.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.620]   No, they're, I don't know who they had who was a graphic designer on staff.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.620]   It's a wood cut.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:13.340]   I think that, I think that it's, it kind of predates Google's, recognizing the value
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.380]   of let's have graphic artists on staff who's the only job is to draw things for us.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.700]   I have, if I can find it during the next break, I will, I actually have a shirt, like not
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.460]   a T-shirt, but an actual button up shirt that is all the different like wood cut like
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.460]   development drawings that they ever made.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.460]   They love that.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:34.740]   And it'd be, you know, people handling gears and like women like, it's, it's, it was a
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.860]   trade dress that kind of made you happy every time you saw like a new ad or a new piece
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   of literature.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.380]   Mr. Cook is going to Washington, but not, not to lobby against the open apps.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.900]   Not to run for president.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:53.660]   And well, maybe later, he is going to go to the judiciary committee to lobby them because
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:58.540]   he wants to oppose the American innovation and choice online act.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:07.180]   Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley, Glassley's a cookie, I think, cookie bill to prevent another
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:13.540]   business's product or service from interoperating with a dominant platform or another business
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.740]   requiring a business to buy a dominant platform's goods or services for preferred placement
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.740]   on its platform.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.340]   Oh, it must, this must be banned.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.940]   This can't be banned, misusing a business's data to compete against it and biasing search
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.860]   results in favor of the dominant firm.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.820]   Who would that be?
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:37.820]   I don't think that's against DuckDuckGo.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   It could be.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.700]   They have a grind of attack for big tech.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.540]   It's the plan is to attack attacks.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.060]   Yeah, I'm threatening.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:49.260]   This was one of those four bills introduced last fall and that are still alive.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.260]   This boat.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.260]   This is Cook's job.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.260]   Like his job is like it's not good for his companies.
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.540]   His job is to go and try and get them to not do it.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.220]   To provide that certain discriminatory conduct by covered platforms shall be unlawful and
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:04.740]   for other purposes, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:11.420]   It's always very significant when a CEO decides to make, when a CEO gives politicians time
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.420]   out of his schedule without being forced to because that time is super, super valuable.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.140]   Not in the way that our time is valuable.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.300]   I mean that you could actually meter how much money is being lost by virtue of the fact
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.860]   that someone was stuck in traffic without access to internet at that level.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:30.180]   But you can see why when you look at this bill that point after point after point, there's
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.140]   like six or seven major bullet points and two or three of them are not vague.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:42.100]   They are like, you are not allowed to have an app store that sells content which demands
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:49.420]   that the store gets any discount that's offered anywhere to anybody else, Apple.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.420]   You're now.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.540]   So it's weird.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.260]   I keep coming back and forth on what I believe about this.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.980]   Now the action this week means that they move forward so now they're going to discuss
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.980]   it.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.820]   There's going to be a lot of changes to it.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:10.260]   I don't know whether I feel like, wow, this could be so disruptive and not in a positive
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.580]   way because a lot of the stuff that makes things work really well is because, are also
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.500]   things that allow technical companies to become a $3 trillion company.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.500]   It's good for the users, good for the shareholders, that's fine.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:27.900]   But also part of me really fundamentally and talk about fundamental beliefs.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.820]   The reason why these companies are worth $1 trillion to $3 trillion is because they have
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.100]   been able to act largely unregulated.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.420]   And is it time for countries across the world to say that, yes, I know that this law is
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:45.540]   absolutely going to suck for you, but oh well, you're going to have to deal with it because
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:51.060]   we decided that we decided that not enough, we decided that you have way too much power
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.940]   and not enough responsibilities rather than limiting your power per se.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.020]   We want to increase your responsibilities.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.660]   That's the sort of thing that I like, increase their responsibilities, not necessarily limit
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.660]   their power.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:07.940]   Bloomberg got a copy of the letter sent to the senators, the judiciary committee by Tim
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.580]   powderly, Apple senior director of government affairs.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.820]   He says, quote, "After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:21.500]   social media, whistle blower allegations of long ignored risks to children and ransomware
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:27.820]   attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:34.180]   making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans, personal devices.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.620]   Unfortunately, that's what these bills would do."
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:45.340]   >> Tim's still filibusters.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.340]   I guess the idea is, I'm not sure why I would threaten security.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.780]   Google, by the way, says it would do the same thing.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.660]   >> Apple believes control equals security.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.640]   So any loss of control means that they can't regulate and otherwise protect us from the
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.380]   vicious, vicious internet out there.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.380]   >> Maybe that's it.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.220]   >> And the bill also calls out, you can't be the exclusive app store, you have to allow
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.700]   it to be outside loading, that is going to be a problem.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:15.060]   >> Apple said the bill's erect, very steep obstacles for the company to instate new privacy
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.060]   controls.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:21.820]   The company also said the legislation would put the app tracking transparency feature
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.500]   in jeopardy.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   Meta doesn't like it, obviously.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.860]   So they're going to, it's in committee.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:37.020]   I don't have to remember my schoolhouse rock, but I think that that's a long way.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.020]   >> A lot.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.020]   >> A lot.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.020]   >> A lot.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.020]   >> A lot.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.380]   >> Some of these bills also will run up against, one of the things they're trying to do is
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.060]   sidestep the judiciary.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.620]   So they have different ways that you can't take it to court and that's unconstitutional.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.180]   So they're going to have a problem with the fact that it, they may put, that may be just
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.520]   an unforced error like the rest of it would go through, but saying you can't use the
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.760]   courts to manage that is actually usurping the judiciary.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.500]   And the judiciary has the choice to say you can't take our power away.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.700]   So what you're, that part of it is very problematic.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.920]   And the reason that they're doing that is because they can't win in a court of law.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:21.140]   So they're going to make this and it's going to get, it's not going to turn over without
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.140]   them taking the judiciary out of it because it's unconstitutional.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:32.200]   And so the thing is you can't take the judiciary out of the system and not expect to be taken
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.000]   straight to the Supreme Court.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.880]   And the Supreme Court at this point is probably not going to take that well.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.040]   So it's going to be one of those things that, so the thing is that they're going to have
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.320]   a hard time cutting the judiciary.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:50.160]   The legislative branch cannot cut the judicial branch out of the system very often.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.520]   And so that's going to be very problematic for them.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:58.240]   If we just saw what just happened last week, the judiciary is clipping the wings of the
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.240]   legislative branch.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.620]   So problems on the Eastern front for Apple.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.980]   Some European carriers are blocking Apple's private relay feature on the iPhone.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.460]   Of course they don't like that.
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   That's not surprising.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.740]   Yeah, I didn't talk about that last week.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   Oh, did we?
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   All right.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.140]   Oh, yeah, that was the T-Mobile thing.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.140]   Right, right, right.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.140]   You're right.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.140]   We did it.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.680]   You know, the entire country on their dime.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.240]   So conflicting interest.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.060]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.200]   I have to say, I am so impressed.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.540]   I've been watching a little bit of football over the last couple of days.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.540]   Can you clarify, please?
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.660]   American Gameplay in America has an egg shaped ball.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.060]   I was just curious.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:47.520]   It involves giant players who are padded to look even more gigantic, beating each other
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.320]   up on the what we call a gridiron.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.160]   Not Ted Lasso with lots of great replays.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.160]   And not like slow.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.920]   Like we play Tony.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   Tony Romo.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.440]   You got Tony Romo's game.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.040]   Oh, man, we enjoyed Tony Romo's game.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.240]   He does not, however.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.160]   He wanted that game, but he did not.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.880]   Yes, we will be watching now the Steelers.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.080]   I'm sorry to apologize for.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.800]   I was looking for Big Ben.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.960]   We were the only thing I wanted was 10 more seconds so that he could get one last touch.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   The last one.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.760]   He was watching a little bit of touchdown.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.800]   It was the Steelers got, you know, they were going to lose.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.120]   And I just wish he had one more play as all he needed was to score one touchdown.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.040]   His last game at three rivers or whatever they call it these days.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040]   That was good.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   Yeah, it was beautiful.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040]   It was moving.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   And I really have always liked Ben Roslisberger.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   He's a quarterback.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:43.200]   That's the guy who throws the egg shaped ball at other players hoping one of them will catch
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   it.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.400]   In any event, I saw quite a few Apple commercials during these games.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   These are expensive commercials.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.240]   Are you talking about the Apple Watch commercials?
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Yeah, hold on.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   We're going to talk about it a bit.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.240]   The Apple Watch and the cinema mode, both of which I thought were really apples clearly
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.920]   got a great new age as well.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   Yeah, hold on.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.720]   We'll talk about it in a second.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.440]   And Apple, you might want to start saving the pennies because the Super Bowl commercials
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.000]   are going to be I think six and a half million dollars for 30 seconds.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.640]   According to Andy, they can just sponsor Mr. Beast at the same view.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.200]   Yeah, maybe more.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   If you just put an ad on baby shark, you would have had 10 billion views.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.840]   Do you know how mad baby beluga must be Leo?
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.240]   Like how salty that they lost.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.040]   Yeah, you know, baby beluga, that was brave.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.080]   But going to how salty they were, that was heroically brave.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.560]   I like people who just I've got this idea for a joke and damn it, I'm just going to run
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   with it.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   Go with it, man.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   Dig a deep, deep.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   It's Heinzfield now.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   It's Heinzfield.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.040]   It's a deep blue sea named after it was 57.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   I still think of Heinzfield as the new, the new, the new field, but it's yeah.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.880]   It's been there for like, I think 30 years now.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   Did the Steelers play in three rivers or just the pirates?
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.280]   I think maybe it was just they both played.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   They both know.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.880]   So they both played there until I don't know the nine somewhere in the 90s.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:10.760]   They built up Heinzfield and then PNC Park, both of, I mean, PNC Park is the best, is the
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.880]   best baseball field in the country.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.120]   But it was the same architect that did a bunch of them.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   They just got better.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.360]   Heinzfield's kind of cool.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:23.640]   Lisa and I and Michael are seriously after the game considering buying tickets to Green
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.040]   Bay for Saturday night's game.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.640]   It's Tampa Bay, right?
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   Wow.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.640]   No, it's us.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.640]   49ers Green Bay Packers.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   Oh, you got to go to Green Bay.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   I have to go with it.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   I've worked.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:38.120]   I've worked in the Green Bay game and I can tell you three three day like it's really
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   cool.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:46.520]   11 PM on a January night is got to be it's snow is in the forecast.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520]   You're headlight free.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:55.320]   I've sat through a whole game in a in the window is open where we were working.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.360]   They have they have inside, you know, booths, but we had to have it open.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   I wanted to.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.360]   I felt films about that.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.800]   I think because he's a root roots for Green Bay.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.960]   So if you go roof for Green Bay, you got to pay yourself green and gold and sit there
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.560]   shirtless for at least half an hour.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   But he would die.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.720]   You're like literally we killed it.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.360]   I know it wouldn't be good.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   It's so cool.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   I grew up in Pittsburgh.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   I grew up in Pittsburgh.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.600]   I'm used to cold, but Green Bay is a different kind of cold.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   It's a cold that hurts.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   It's yeah, we decided.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.960]   Okay, we'll stay home and watch it.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.920]   And coke come fines, come feet, come fines.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   I've always just 50.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.200]   I wanted to go to Lambo Field and you know, for Christmas, you can buy, I didn't know
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.160]   this, but you can buy into the Green Bay Packers.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.520]   They're owned by the community as is Lambo Field.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.000]   I bought Michael a share and he's got to like a stock share.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.760]   Yeah, he's got a vote and share and then Green Bay Packers.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.920]   Now, if you're a fan, how much does it cost?
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.240]   How much does it cost to have a share of the three hundred bucks?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   Okay, there you go.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   And you get a nice certificate.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   Is it a DOA?
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   D-A-L, sorry?
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.880]   No, it's an NFT.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   No, it's neither.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.960]   It's something we, in the old days, we used to call them stock certificates.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   It's called, yes.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.800]   You also get the tallest and grandest cheese head in all the land.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.000]   Oh, he already has that, man.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.720]   I don't know how, he's a child.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.440]   Lisa is like a seasoned ticket holder of the 49ers.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.280]   I don't know how this happened except that I think he's basically a Canada, right?
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   Yeah, basically.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.480]   You're in our, it's like the place in the north of Montreal, I think.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.760]   I mean, it's really, anyway.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   On we go with the show.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.000]   Let me take a break and then we'll talk about ads.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.680]   But I want to talk about Zachtok right now.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.920]   Zachtok, Z or Z for you, Renee?
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.080]   O-C-D-O-C.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.560]   I love this idea.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.600]   There are some amazing doctors out there, but really the only ones that matter, the ones
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.200]   that take your insurance, obviously, right?
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.120]   You want to pay out a pocket for this.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.000]   With Zachtok, you could focus on doctors who are in network, putting you on the path
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.880]   to see doctors who are right for you.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:02.280]   No more time wasted hunting down Ants, Shirley's cash only chiropractor or the dentist, your
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.920]   coworker recommended only to find out he's out of network.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.640]   That'll be $3,000, please.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.360]   No one knows what you're looking for in a doctor better than you, right?
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.720]   And no one's given you better tools to find the perfect doctor than Zachtok.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.600]   The people who created Zachtok, you know, and this is what I love about Silicon Valley.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.840]   They were really looking at the pain points, the biggest pain points in healthcare, all
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.000]   the things that weren't working.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.760]   And they said, "Hey, enough.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.400]   We can do a better job."
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:34.120]   So they've made booking a great doctor surprisingly pain-free.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:41.600]   Primary care, dentist, OBGYN, dermatologist, psychiatrist, eye doctors, chiropractor, Zachtok
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.960]   is a free app that shows you doctors who are patient-reviewed, take your insurance, and
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.200]   are available when you need them.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.560]   You can read up on local doctors.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.200]   You can get there's actually verified patient reviews right there.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.840]   I think that's super important.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:54:00.280]   I wish people were talking about these kinds of things like, "You shouldn't go to this
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   one.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   You should go to this one.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:07.880]   See what I can go on and on about trials and tribulations we've had."
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.760]   But now you can see what other humans have to say about their visits.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.400]   So when you walk into that doctor's office, you're set up to see someone in your network
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.240]   who gets you.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.840]   DoC, doC.com.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.080]   Choose a time slot.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   Whether you want to see the doctor in person or do a video visit, yes, you have a choice,
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.160]   and just like that, you're booked.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.320]   Find the doctor that's right for you.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.760]   Book an appointment that works for your schedule.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.360]   Millions of people use Zachtok every month.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.720]   It's got a very broad network, very broad reach.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.760]   It can be your go-to whenever you need to find someone in a book a doctor.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.480]   And nowadays, when you need a doctor, you kind of need a doctor fast, don't you?

[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   All right.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.760]   We just did an ad, but I want to see Apple's ads.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:29.360]   So I've been watching on the football games, the Apple Watch ads.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.720]   I'll tell you how effective they were.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.240]   We were sitting there.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:37.200]   Lisa's ex, who's also an honors fan, comes over to watch the games.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:44.760]   He's watching the ad, the one where the guy fell down a cliff or something.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.640]   Wait, wait, let me see if I can find these.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.760]   Because if you haven't seen them, they're really effective.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.080]   There's a bunch of them there.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.840]   Yeah, here you go.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.200]   This is-- and listen to the audio.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.440]   I'm going to have to turn it up because that's really what works.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   What's your emergency?
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   I just hit in the car.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.440]   I hit my car.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.440]   It's flipped.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.440]   There's water getting the car.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.440]   And I can't get out.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.440]   That's all I want.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.440]   What is your emergency?
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.440]   I came out tired of boarding and a hard wind.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.440]   It's pushing me out to sea.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.440]   OK, do not hang up.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.440]   9-1-1, what's your emergency?
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.440]   I'm here as a farm.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   I drove my legs.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.440]   They say it's out of 21 feet.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   I sure.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.440]   I sure need help, please.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   Are you by yourself?
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   Yes.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   Have you tried to get out?
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   You tried to bust the window or something?
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.440]   I'm pretty far out in the ocean.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.440]   In my case, you get to myself, or I'm talking about Apple Watch.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.440]   Try to keep talking to me.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   OK.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   I can't wipe the wind anymore.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.440]   It's getting deeper.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   Can you come in next?
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.440]   Please hurry.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   I'm working real bad.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.440]   You're going to see help, OK?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   I see them.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   I'm sitting just a...
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   Hold on.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   Are you in here, Bob?
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   I'm just in the darkness.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   OK, so you're headed above water?
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   Here, sir.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   All three of those.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.440]   These are real 9-1-1 calls.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   All three of them were saved thanks to their Apple Watch.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   Mike bought a watch within 60 seconds to see in that ad.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   I think he's not alone.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   I get teary.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   Just watching that.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   Have you seen that before Renee?
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   Is that new to you?
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   I don't know if they're showing it in camera.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   Yeah, no, I saw it.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   And there was a bunch of outrage on the Internet too because people couldn't decide if it was
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   good to promote that Apple saves lives or if Apple was trying to frighten people into buying Apple watches.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.440]   No, that's the game a lot.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.440]   That is, I think, the closest thing to a perfect ad I've ever seen.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   Yeah, it's terrifying.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   And I know, you know, somebody in the chatroom said, "I get very...
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.440]   It's very stressful to hear that."
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   But boy, they all got hope and they all...
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.440]   She says, "I'm on my Apple Watch.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   I can't reach my phone."
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.440]   It makes you want an Apple Watch.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   Apple Watch.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   Like, what else would you do?
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   Did you see the other one where I think was a...
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   A bicyclist.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.440]   A biker, exactly.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.440]   Who basically...
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.440]   The watch called...
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.440]   I guess I should play this too, yeah.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.440]   Because that was even more impressive.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:05.440]   Yeah, the watch called for him because he was not unconscious.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   It's sense to crash and then it tried to, as the UI is supposed to do, it said, "Hey,
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.440]   if you're okay, tap this button to let me know you're okay."
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   And then when it didn't, it automatically dialed 911 and a voice basically walked...
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.440]   Yeah, let me play the audio.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.440]   Why?
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   Why?
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   Why can't I find that one?
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   I'll say in advance, I'm surprised that the voice was that bad.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.440]   It was okay.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.440]   It's coming from a freaking watch.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   No, I know, but...
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   Okay, let me see.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   Apple Watch had 911...
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   Cyclist, maybe that'll...
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   Maybe that's Searchal Dude.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.440]   It's not on their YouTube page for some reason.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.440]   Oh, yeah, here it is.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.440]   It's called 911 Bob.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   Here you go.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   The owner of this Apple Watch has taken a hard fall and is not responding to their watch.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:12.440]   The emergency location is Latitude 47.7, Longitude minus 117.5 with an estimated Search radius of 41 meters.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   This message will repeat in five seconds.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   Bob fell off his bicycle.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   He was knocked unconscious.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   His watch automatically called 911 and he was rescued.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.440]   I presume, although Apple doesn't say that on this one.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   I hope it ended well for Bob.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   Hope they found Bob.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   You know what?
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   If you're going to knock it, that is...
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   The music is...
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.440]   Very...
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   Like, oh my God, music.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.440]   I think these days, though, to break above, especially when you're watching NFL football
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   where all the ads are very expensive, to break above the crowd, you've got to do something.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   And boy, those ads...
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   Yeah, really work.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.440]   And the other bonus is that we assume that everybody who owns a device knows about all the features on that device.
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   And I can imagine that there's not a few Apple Watch owners who don't understand that it will call emergency services for you.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   And there's a way you can have it...
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.440]   I'm sure they wouldn't pay the extra for the GSM connection if they hadn't...
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.440]   You have to have LTE for all of that stuff that we just saw to work.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440]   I guess you do.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440]   I have to have the watch with LTE.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440]   I think so, yeah.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   But you don't have to have a plan, as long as you have the watch that has that capabilities anywhere in the world, it'll do emergency calling for you, even if you don't have a plan.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440]   Oh, that's good to know.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440]   Emergency alert.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   Because actually, Mike said, "Should I get the LTE?" and I said, "No."
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.440]   Because I figure he's always going to have his phone with him.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   But maybe yes, if he didn't have to spend the $10 a month extra to this...
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.440]   If you plan on going out without your phone, like if your phone is damaged, it's like an insurance policy.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   If you always have your phone with you, maybe it's fine.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.440]   But if your phone is damaged, or like people who go paddleboarding and don't have their phone with them, then the LTE is really handy.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   Or maybe you're not going to be able...
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   When the car is turned over three times, maybe you're not going to be able to find the phone in the car, but your wrist is probably still accessible.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   It is great.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   I think it's reasonable to ask how scary is this for reasonable people.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.440]   But the thing is, it is talking about scary situations.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   And what sells fire extinguishers is, and hey, now we've got the rainbow colors.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   It's that, "Hey, here's a person... I'm dead on his truth.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:24.440]   There's that famous... It's a famous like viral video of a Japanese man who's streaming, and he's showing off his new lighter.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   And it's almost... If enough for the fact that if turning to a whole disaster that tore down the entire building,
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   his attempts to put out the fire, he did everything wrong.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   And that's what... And part of it was because he did not have a fire extinguisher handy.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.440]   He kept trying to do all these different weird things to try to put out the flames and just made it higher and higher.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.440]   And that was one of the things that made me... At the time, I didn't have a current fire extinguisher,
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.440]   and that's when I just went out to Amazon, clicked on a new window and ordered three right there,
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440]   and made sure that there's always a fire.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.440]   So yeah, it's not the happy Teletubbies message that gets people to buy the thing,
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   the emergency equipment they need to have on hand before the emergency happens.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   Your response also that... And I'm sure this is Apple's intent.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.440]   These ads not only sell the product, but they teach people who have the product about capabilities.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   This is cinematic mode, and Alex, I think you probably... I don't have you seen this one, the detectives.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.440]   I don't... It's really good.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.440]   This is really good. Two detectives. It looks like a traditional gritty cop show.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.440]   They're sitting in a beat up Ford Taurus in a beat up location.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.440]   Can I ask you a question?
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.440]   And I had a focus.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   They're fine.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   That's the cop in the back.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.440]   Yeah, but look at me, I'm all blurry.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.440]   Mom? You're supporting cast.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.440]   What?
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   The camera focus on the most important character, Rich, is me.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:04.440]   What if my character had a big reveal?
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440]   Like what?
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.440]   Like maybe I'm the killer?
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.440]   Are you?
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.440]   Now he's in focus, all of a sudden.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   Right, focus.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.440]   No.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.440]   Back to the background.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:34.440]   A couple of things I know it on this ad. First of all, the lead cop, greatest actor ever.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.440]   Very good, subtle gestures.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.440]   I mean, just beautifully act. Both of them actually did a great job.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:47.440]   But also just a really perfect example of cinema mode.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.440]   And the most cinematic mode of racked focus, it's perfect.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   The phone has come along.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440]   I'm not saying you shoot a feature phone with it.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.440]   I mean, I know that's the sound.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   No, and in fact, I think a lot of people will never use cinematic mode, but it's just cool.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.440]   But if you want to do, you know, if you want to, there are a lot of places you could use that.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.440]   And especially fun places to use it that I think are great in the fact that you just do it with your phone.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440]   Yeah, it's just really cool.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.440]   Yeah, as that feature really been really been working out the one thing that I was curious about.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.440]   I still don't have the new iPhone. I still don't have it.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:37.440]   But the one thing that I was curious about seeing the demos and seeing the release was that how if you've got three kids who are all acting like a bunch of squirrels jumping in and out, how is it possible to make sure that like they doesn't just keep like switching focus and giving you a heading trying to watch the thing.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.440]   Is it capable of it?
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   Yeah, it'll go to the first person and it'll lock on their eye line. And then if that eye line moves, it'll go to the next closest person.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   You can manually override it. I think the issues a lot of people had those that Apple deliberately chose to put it on all iPhone. So they didn't include any of the LiDAR in it.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.440]   And that would have improved low light performance, but they wanted to make it ubiquitous for everybody.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.440]   So the first version doesn't include any LiDAR. So if you go to low light, you have the same problem that you had with the traditional portrait mode.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   And that is, there's just not enough for it to actually understand the scene.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   So it works really well right now in daylight and it's going to get better every year, obviously.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:24.440]   That is the limitation. And the cool thing is that it goes beyond the main sensor. Like you use this ultra wide angle sort of preload what gazes are coming into the frame so that if it sees someone else coming in closer, it's already on them by the time they enter into the frame.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.440]   And that makes it very, very smooth.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   And if you look at like what DGI is doing with their, some of their new cameras, that's probably a preview of where Apple could go, which is the idea that using the LiDAR,
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:47.440]   the way DGI is using it, they're using LiDAR to literally show you as a focus puller, you can be looking on an iPad and on the touchscreen there and making, you know, controlling it,
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.440]   but you see the outline of the person inside of the focus of what you're doing.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   And I think that Filmic Pro, you know, once they get, they could probably build that into it to make sure that the remote control actually had a lot of control over what it's doing.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   And I think that that's probably not too far away. I'm guessing, you know, within the next year, we'll start seeing it.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   And that starts to be where, yeah, you could get an expensive camera, but if you're not going to get an expensive camera, you could do an enormous amount of damage.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:28.440]   That's always my, one of my hottest buttons on technology is when I find myself, like something screwing up and I find myself saying, wow, this would be a great piece of software or a great feature or a great piece of hardware.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:38.440]   If it didn't keep trying to make, trying to work better on its own regard without asking me, hey, do you, do you really, do you want the background to be completely washed out?
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   Because I could do that. And I imagine the cinematic mode saying, you are never, I know that there's a dude walking behind like my friend who's singing the song, but the fact that he looked into the camera and her eyes were closed doesn't mean please change the focus to the dude walking behind her in the camera.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   I just, I just want to.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   Which is my favorite thing.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.440]   Right.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:07.440]   That's going to be truly revolutionary is that you can just go in afterwards, not only change the focal point, but also change the amount of depth effect.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.440]   You can change it from like F two point something to F four point five.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.440]   And focus, focus was doing that.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.440]   Focus was doing that with, you know, with the photos for a long time.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   And yeah, I just wanted to work.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:24.440]   Whatever it does automatically, I just need to do better than my air club pro.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   Yeah, deciding which, which Apple device I would like to attach to.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.440]   That's the, that's the low bar.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.440]   Oh, God.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440]   That's it.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.440]   That's been coming up in my life too.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:50.440]   Now that I'm doing a little bit more things in public, I don't, I don't have air pods, but it's like, I was, last time I was on Amtrak, I was like, I really wish that my iPad wouldn't keep informing me that somebody on this train has just opened up an iPod, a pair of an AirPods because that's not relevant to me.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440]   It really isn't.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   Speaking of rumors, where we, I didn't think we are, but I will now say let's speak of rumors.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   Analysts, Ross Young on Twitter and others now are saying that the next iPhone 14 will have a whole plus pill.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.440]   Punch out.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   Next, the mission mark, whole and pill.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:27.440]   Smaller hole will not be visible, will not be invisible, the two whole concept will be unique to Apple like the notch, not similar to all the pill models from Huawei. Is Ross reliable?
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440]   Yes.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   He's very reliable because he just sits there and looks at the supply chain.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:39.440]   And it really looks like, honestly, it looks like, you know, it's got a little stamp on it, little Chinese on the stamp. Definitely looks like something might have leaked out of.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   And that's backwards.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   So you flipped that around and that's what it's going to look like on the phone.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.440]   Ah.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440]   Okay.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   Okay.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   I'm just glad that Apple's finally addressing this because as we all know, there were so many people, I think it's actually double digit percentage of iPhone users that just as they said on social media when the first renders of the of the eyebrow were first, were first, the notch first appeared.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.440]   They were, they can't look at it without vomiting.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   So every time they're using their phone, they're just vomiting right onto the screen.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   And now I can't imagine what after two or three years that's done to the RPG I system.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.440]   So this is a very, very humanist sort of approach from Apple.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.440]   Actually, you know, then not, I thought I would really hate the notch on the Mac book.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.440]   And I've gotten used to that even, although it does occasionally.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   I think fantastical because I have so much stuff in my menu.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   I don't, I think fantastical is actually, I can't see it.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.440]   I think it must be under the notch.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   So I'm sure Flexi bits will figure that out and move it.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   But other than that, there's a lot of stuff like that where it's not that, it's not that you are, you know, you're not going to see it.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   But you ever think it's a good idea?
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.440]   It's not that you necessarily don't wish that you could have the old way back.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   But okay, you'll get over it.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   It'll, it won't ruin the experience experience.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   You really have to break it hard, compound fracture in order to say, okay, guess what?
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   I'm going to look at Windows or Linux right now because I just can't deal with this anymore.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440]   No, it's really the other direction.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   That's what Microsoft is pretty much done with Windows.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440]   And it was flowing in the opposite direction.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.440]   Actually, PC sales were up big time last year.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:17.440]   And Apple, the biggest growth, they're old, still only 8.5% of overall PC sales, according to analysts.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.440]   But the fan firing on all cylinders over the last two years.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440]   A lot of people buying those Macs.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.440]   So good.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   And I have to say, you know, I mean, we are starting to hear rumors about, well, one rumor I just read, and I think it's kind of what you've already said Renee, not so much as a rumor is just, you know, likely is that the Mac Pro will actually be able to see it.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:43.440]   The Mac Pro will actually be just a beefed up M1 and that the LBM2 is coming out this year for probably for Mac Books, that air.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   Well, that'll be the low end one.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.440]   Like Apple previously had that.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   This is the MacBook Pro for people who like the MacBook Air, but want the Pro brand.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   And that was the one that didn't have the touch bar at first.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.440]   And now ironically, it's the only one with the touch bar.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   And that's going to be replaced by an M2 version.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.440]   So you'll have the M2 MacBook Air and then the M2 MacBook Pro.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440]   The difference being the air is going to have no fan.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   So it's going to have like a limit of 15, 20 minutes of like full out heavy workload.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:17.440]   And then if you do want to sustain longer than that, you can get the MacBook Pro M2 and that'll just have a, what Apple calls an active cooling system, but it's a fan.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440]   So you can do a lot of harder workloads.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.440]   Should I get silly to ask.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.440]   But I didn't buy it.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   Well, no, I was thinking, should I get a beefed up Mac mini, which I could likely get in the next six months or wait till the fall for a little mini Mac Pro, which sounds so cute on my desk.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   I, you're going to fall anywhere.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440]   You'll use them all.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:47.440]   I mean, the great thing about the Mac mini is you have, I mean, I have a five inch, Alex is sitting on four of them right now.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   I have a 55.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   I have a OLED gaming monitor from Alienware.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   Right now it's running Linux, you know, in Valheim.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   But I would really like to attach a Mac to it.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   I don't know if a 55 inch Mac experience would be very good or not, but I'd like to try.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   And so the mini be fine for that, right?
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   I have three, I have three Mac minis in my space right now.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   Like literally in my system is three, you know, and the thing is, is at that price point, it is, you know, you don't feel bad about putting it and using something else.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   And it's so powerful.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   The M1 is.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.440]   I think it's really, yeah.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.440]   I'm very.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   I'm very, the coolest, the M1 mini Mac mini is the coolest Mac I bought.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.440]   I'm super happy with the M1 Pro laptop.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   It's incredible.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:38.440]   I'm running a very, very, very slow brute force search online right now.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.440]   And it's using 11 cores, 97% of 11 cores.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   And it has the fans not on.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]   It's not hot.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440]   It's a hundred percent.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   The CPUs cannot, cannot saturate that machine.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440]   If you're just running CPUs, you will never saturate.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440]   You will never deflauce something like that.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.440]   Really?
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.440]   Wow.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   The envelope is big enough.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   You have to hit the GPUs if you want to start hurting that machine.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   This is all CPU.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.440]   Wow.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   That's really interesting.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:12.440]   Because remember those i7 machines, even the i9 Macbook Pro you had to put in the freezer, it would, it would throttle.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:18.440]   It got to 100 degrees Celsius and it would throttle and it would do that in seconds.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.440]   Intel changed the definition of turbo to accommodate what, because they could no longer keep a heat envelope.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:29.440]   They would say that it was opportunistic and it would just go like this every millisecond trying to get as much frequency as they could.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440]   It was crazy.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440]   The downs are going.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.440]   Crazy.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.440]   And the fans are going and the whole thing.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   This thing is just, you know, it's, it's, it doesn't keep me warm though.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.440]   And like the Macbook doesn't do my coffee high anymore.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   It's like the biggest downgrade of these machines.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.440]   I lose my free space heater.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:52.440]   The European as we always, the, the, the European FCC database, what do they call it?
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:14:00.440]   It's the gift that keeps on giving cons so Mac.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   The new iPhone model numbers, the Eurasian Economic Commission has, has been a good source in past
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   and apparently has some new model numbers.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   Looks like iPhones and iPads.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:21.440]   According to nine to five Mac likely representing the upcoming iPhone SE plus and the iPad Air.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   The new iPhone models, a 25 95 20 73 27 84.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   Quite a few on the iPad.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:35.440]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight iPad models.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   Do they, do they give a different model number for a different color?
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   Sometimes.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.440]   Sometimes.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.440]   Okay.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440]   So, but a lot of SKUs that's 11 new.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   It could just be also radios, but they, their radios are so simple these days.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   If now I don't know what the timelines are, but it's now that what I think that bodes well for a spring release.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.440]   Yes.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.440]   It doesn't.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   It doesn't because like this is the iPhone SE, which is basically the old iPhone SE with a 5G radio
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.440]   and a faster processor, which is fine.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:11.440]   And also the iPad Air is basically the same iPad Air, but with a 5G radio, you know, and a faster processor in it.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   So it's a, it's a very SE upgrade, but I think people who had their hopes set on M2 Max are going to be sad.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.440]   Well, there will be other things.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.440]   What you think the M2 Max will be June, WWDC.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:36.440]   I hope for sure. Like I think the unveiling, like, you know, they often show the Mac Pro, Mac Pro, sorry, June and then ship it December 31st at 11.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440]   59 p.m.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.440]   Well, June is coming quicker than we think.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.440]   I hope.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440]   Is it?
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   You think 2022 is going to be fast like 2021 or slow like 2020.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   I'm not sure yet feels like.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   So.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.440]   2021 hardly happened.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.440]   It was just like it's been 2022 for a year already.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   So maybe iPad Air 5 also rumored with 5G center stage camera also spring, according to 95 Mac and Mako Takara.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   That's exciting reliable sources in China.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.440]   Does that seem credible? iPad Air 5.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   I mean, it'll be like the 2016 event where we got the iPhone SE and the small iPad Pro.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.440]   It's basically what the iPad is becoming.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440]   And this would be the debut.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.440]   No, not the.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.440]   I guess the debut of the A15 on the iPad, right?
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.440]   I don't think they put that on there.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.440]   The mini has A15.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440]   The mini does.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440]   The mini does.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   I love that mini.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   And do I love that?
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   It's so fast.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   So great.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440]   Okay.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   Okay.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:52.440]   And then the SE plus this year will be replaced next year, according to some rumors, by a bigger SE.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.440]   Next year or the year after with an iPhone XR, iPhone 11 chassis.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.440]   So it'll go to the modern people who are going to stick it.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.440]   Like people who just want their home button will be really sad at that point.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   Oh, that's right.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.440]   People want it to modern.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440]   That's right.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.440]   I forgot about that.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.440]   When are we going to see type C on an iPhone?
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.440]   Does it have to be USB C?
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440]   I think it has to come.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.440]   I think it has to be sometime soon.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440]   I mean, I don't know about type C, but I think Thunderbolt.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   I mean, we need faster.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   I mean, now that you're doing ProRes, you really need a faster connector.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   So maybe I don't think they're going to do it.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   I think they're going to look at it and say that six year old technology and we're going to be Apple and we're going to make like I was joking in my video today. I did a 20 minute video today on what Apple could do post lightning.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:33.440]   And you could see like a lightning type C, which is half because type C just a plug.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   You use type C for a lot of things.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:41.440]   There's a whole bunch of different protocols behind type C or they could just go MagSafe and then you slap MagSafe on the back and it charges and does data exchange.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   That seems like more of my own than a six year old plug.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.440]   I agree with you.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.440]   Actually, I think having USB three or four over type C is very, very viable.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   I think it's maybe the most convenient solution for people who are using actual humans or using phones.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   But I don't I think that Apple is going to make that kind of a big change where they're going to suddenly get rid of you as lightning on the most popular platform.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:10.440]   I do think that the Apple that I know and love is going to say, why don't we just have no no ports whatsoever.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   And that's where as that might have been said in just a couple of years ago.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   Now it's like, yeah, you know what, they've got MagSafe.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:22.440]   They could even put a Poga plug on the surface on the surface of it for to do stuff that they wouldn't that couldn't do wirelessly.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440]   I don't I let me be really clear.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:39.440]   I don't that wouldn't be my favorite way to do to access data on a phone because something like like Alex said, sometimes I just don't I just can't use iCloud as a way of moving data from one place or another.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.440]   Sometimes a drop is not going to work for for this huge file.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   But I that is that feels like the sort of thing that Apple would do rather than simply say this rather simply use the standard that they're going to probably want to get rid of in three years anyway.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:06.440]   Yeah, I saw this great conversation between John Gruber and Steve Aquino who does all the great accessibility stuff and they were just talking about how they can barely see the lightning port now like for them it's it's not an advantage like they can barely get it in and it's really tough and you got to fiddle with it a lot.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:25.440]   And if it just had something like MagSafe and MagSafe could be like it is on the Mac could just be, you know, and I just want to point out the irony the irony that I saw where everybody who's been lobbying for USB on the iPhone to get rid of lightning go standardized USB a lot of them were also lobbying to get rid of USB on the Mac book and go to MagSafe because it's just so convenient.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   And it turns out that like convenience versus compatibility is like a big internal battle inside nerd hearts, but to have something that would be like as easy and accessible just a magnetic version of USB C, you bring it close enough to go slack and you're connected.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.440]   That's a huge win for anybody in accessibility community.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   I think you could put you could build a MagSafe ahead of USB C in the center of it so that if you're in Europe you can use the USB C and the MagSafe is the cool one whatever one will use but yeah we got the other one just in case you want to.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   Well the European Union doesn't care about like they only care about the plug so if they can show it's MagSafe then they're exempt from all that regulation.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:20.440]   Yeah, which is also interesting. Well the solution is to support right to repair and user upgradability 100% there's a I flagged a story that came across a couple of days ago where someone because you know the framework laptop which is all modular you can fix everything yourself and also the ports are like modules you can slide in and out.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:35.440]   So I don't think that's really that but the schematics are the schematics are open source the CAD files are open source so someone said I want MagSafe on my framework laptop so they made a MagSafe compatible or MagSafe like power connector for the framework and I'm like
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:44.440]   I don't want to switch to Windows but I kind of really want that laptop now.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:53.440]   I'm going to give credit to Michael Sargent because I think he put this in the rundown of course our producer and the host of iOS today and I just set this up and it's the coolest thing ever.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:15.440]   So it comes from a guy who was a developer, a summer developer, former Apple Worldwide Developer Conference Student Scholarship winner, recent UC Santa Barbara grad named Matt Moss and it was a side project which he built for his girlfriend and it's now one of the hottest apps on the iPhone.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   So I'm talking about Locket. Have you seen this? You can have up to five friends be your Locket contacts and then it becomes a widget.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   It could be a pretty big widget too on your home screen and they can automatically send photos to your home screen into the widget.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   It's perfect for the one person you care a lot about to have a Locket. I love the name. I've just asked Lisa to...
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.440]   No, no, you don't send those. You send nice pictures.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.440]   Like the guys in the shower and just a whole bunch of photos are just being jammed into your home screen.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440]   Please stop. Please stop.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   I'm thinking more like you found out that your partner cheated on you but you're playing dumb because you know that in two weeks time they're going to be getting a little bit more on your phone.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   In two weeks time they're going to be giving a keynote in front of 500 people and they're doing it from their iPad.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.440]   Well, honey, I just found this really great. I just wanted to...
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:30.440]   Back in the iMore days we actually got a really angry letter about when Apple started doing the photo stream because someone sent her husband a bunch of photos while she was away traveling and they had just set up to show their parents how the Apple TV world and they had photo stream as a screensaver.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.440]   So, like, I'll be in laws or just like Apple needs to stop this technology immediately.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.440]   Of course, the insight into that one.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   The insight into that one.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   It was did by three to be fair.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   I was excited about it except for that I've really gotten against this whole like, give me your contacts.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.440]   I know it says it doesn't save them but it was like, it said, "Okay, now I want, you know, please give me access.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.440]   I won't work with an app now that asks for my contact list."
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.440]   Like it's just, you know, like it's like, "Whoop, I'm not going to do that."
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440]   It's one that does but you can't do it.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   You can't do it.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.440]   You can't use it.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440]   You can't use it without it says it stays on your phone.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   It says they're not sending it to themselves.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.440]   I know it does.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   I just don't want, I don't have any reason for that.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   I want to be able to invite people.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.440]   I just want to be able to invite people to do it and connect through them and not.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   I get the stickiness of doing that.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440]   That's, I don't appreciate that.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.440]   You know, like, and so, how are you super excited about it?
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   How else you can invite someone?
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.440]   You could just invite someone and create a connection.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.440]   Oh, but it makes you, you have to get.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.440]   You can't use it without it.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.440]   Matthew, knock it off.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440]   It's a great idea.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:39.320]   But I have to admit, I've started to take kind of a, I think, clubhouse got me super sensitive
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   to it.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   And I just felt like it was gooey.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.560]   And so it's been something I've been kind of pushing back on.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.560]   I am with you.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.960]   In fact, I've been starting to say this.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:53.080]   It's doxing your friends because you're sending everything you know about your entire contact
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.520]   list to a third party.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:00.640]   That's, that's, that is, I mean, one thing to send your information to a third party,
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.000]   you're sending all your friends information to the third party.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   Yes.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   Wrong.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   I agree with you.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   And it's too bad that they require that.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.960]   That's, but it's a great, it's a, it's an incredible idea.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.640]   Like I was, I was, as soon as I saw it, I was like, oh, I got to download it.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.240]   I'll put, you know, put my family on it.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.240]   It will have fun with it.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240]   I know it'd be great for sure.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240]   I could see how it'd be tons of fun.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.520]   And I was just like, and if all I had to do was invite them, invite their dot, even if
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.720]   it was just their dot Mac, I invite each one of them and they have to accept it.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.200]   And then I heard it, because I don't want the app to touch my contacts unless the contact
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.520]   on the other end has a set of it was okay.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520]   100%.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.160]   But like I have a lot of contacts and I'm not, and all of them would not appreciate me connected
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   to an app.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   Exactly.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   Okay.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.200]   Matthew, just take a little word of advice.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.040]   Sorry for pouring all the gold water on your face.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040]   No, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.040]   You're absolutely right.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.280]   I'm glad it's not necessary.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.600]   My pick of the week or anything.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.240]   I'm just reporting a story.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.040]   It's Micah Sargent's fault.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:25:02.200]   No, I think this is something people don't even think about.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.960]   And they're doing it all the time.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.800]   And it really is problematic.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.880]   It really is problematic.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:14.520]   Apple has updated the firmware for AirPods three, four C one seven zero came out today.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.600]   That's, that is all.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   That is all.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.600]   Don't know.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.080]   There's an easy way to do this, by the way.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.760]   You connect your iPad AirPods pro to the iOS device.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:34.400]   You open the settings app, you type the general tab, type the about tab, type AirPods.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.720]   Look at the number next to the firmware version.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:37.720]   And then what?
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.720]   I don't know.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.800]   You wait until they're charging and they update.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.360]   And then half the people will say these sound better.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.600]   Half people will sound worse and I'll want to hide for a week.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.320]   I will say that the one thing that that did get Apple fixed, Apple fixed sometime recently.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.640]   I didn't know exactly when, but someone suggested it is that there was a problem with ICal
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.720]   and exchange that would mean that every time you went to a new page in ICal, it would take
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.720]   like 20 seconds.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.080]   And it was there and Apple fixed it in the last Mac.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.080]   Okay.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   Updates and now it's all.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.480]   It was kind of like having me go.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.720]   I need to go back to something else.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.120]   I mean, it was like really a problem.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.120]   What do you mean?
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.120]   Get rid of exchange.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   I can't.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120]   It's not my company.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.760]   So the, yeah, it's not something I picked on.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.040]   Here's a good news for anybody who uses Microsoft products.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:30.040]   Excel is now fully M1 native.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.760]   Microsoft has released Office for Mac update.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.480]   Just Excel, although Excel is the one that does all the calculations.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.480]   So I guess it's probably the-
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.960]   That's the one Tim Cook does pivot tables in.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   That's right.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   That was pressure.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   So you can actually use a Rosetta emulator to run Excel.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.080]   You may disable it and run Excel natively on your device.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.720]   I don't know if you need to disable it.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:54.560]   I think it would automatically work, but users can get the new version using the auto
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.280]   updater that comes with Office.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:02.880]   Another incredibly annoying background task that's running on people's Macs.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.520]   Oh, I can say is if you have a Mac and you're not doing heavy calculations, like real spread
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.960]   sheets, if you're using the spreadsheet to organize things, numbers is a hundred times
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   better.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.960]   Like a hundred times better.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.120]   And it looks so nice.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.720]   You can take a numbers file and I submit those as bids.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.600]   And they're pretty and I've got pictures in them and I've got all this other stuff.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.560]   And I open up Excel and I'm like, oh, this would be horrible.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.440]   And if you're doing one page like simple like bids and everything else, there's just
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.600]   a, there's another life out there.
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.600]   I'm just letting you know.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.480]   Like definitely numbers slow, slows down when you start doing heavy tables.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.240]   Like I've done heavy tables and it takes a long time to, and I wouldn't, I would use
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.840]   Excel for that.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.600]   But, but that's not, that's only like 1% of the users of a number of Excel are doing
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.600]   that.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.600]   Everyone else is always in a bigger life.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.440]   I actually don't think that's the case because a lot of people use it in finance.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.040]   I'm at least has got a lot of people that have Excel.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.600]   But there's a lot of people that have Excel.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.720]   There's definitely a lot of people in finance, but there's a lot of like, I get these Excel
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.440]   files from clients all the time that are just like a list of the things.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.440]   It's just a list.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.440]   It's just a list.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.840]   I think that's, that's the vast majority.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.160]   I mean, there's definitely lots of finance people that are doing it, but all the people
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.360]   that have 365 that open up an Excel dog, not very many of them are doing things that
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   wouldn't be better.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   People who care about that will be very happy.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.280]   Lisa will be very happy to learn this.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.120]   She bought a 49 inch monitor because she runs some of these spreadsheets and she wants
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.280]   to be able to see them.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.280]   I mean, talk about big tables.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.760]   She wants to be able to see them spread out.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.160]   She lives in Excel.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.320]   So she'll be, she'll be glad to hear.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.880]   I think we use Google Sheets a lot, but we use it just as you said, Alex is kind of a
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.880]   list.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.040]   Like if you need to interact with other people, Google Sheets is the way to do it.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.120]   Like that's, we, yeah, what I do is actually build them in numbers because it's so much
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.280]   faster than I save it out as an Excel file, then I open it in numbers.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.720]   I'm sorry, open it in Google Sheets.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.920]   And then I share it with everybody because the sharing in numbers is horrible.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:04.320]   One of the reasons that I traded in my Tesla for a Mustang Mach-E is that Tesla uses its
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.880]   own multimedia software.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.280]   And I wanted CarPlay, damn it.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.800]   In fact, I was very happy.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:14.360]   The Mach-E just got an update that lets CarPlay use almost the entire screen.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360]   That's nice.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.400]   That's a big ass CarPlay.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   I love it.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.760]   Is that a new feature of CarPlay or did Ford just enable it?
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.000]   I don't think CarPlay has ever, it's always been up to the manufacturer to enable this
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   cause how they display it.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   How they display it.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   Are the controls?
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Cause suddenly the side bars move to the bottom, which is of course a good place for it.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.960]   Cause it's got a lot of real estate top to bottom.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.560]   The icons are big, but I see more of them.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.560]   The maps are great.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.560]   I mean, it's really nice.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:47.200]   Unfortunately, Tesla refuses to adopt CarPlay or Android Auto.
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.440]   But there is a workaround.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.360]   That is a strange thing to see in a Model 3.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:30:01.600]   Apparently a Polish developer, Mikhail Gopinski, has figured out how to do it.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.240]   Tesla doesn't even support Apple music.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.240]   I didn't realize that.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.240]   That's ridiculous.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.240]   You play everything through TuneIn.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.680]   Give me a break.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:16.720]   The video shows him running CarPlay on his Model 3 screen.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:21.800]   He says the steering wheel scroll button is working, which is good.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.120]   But here's the downside.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:32.160]   You have to run a separate Raspberry Pi with a custom build of Android.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:39.480]   And then basically it's a server which you load into the Tesla and Car browser.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.440]   And the mouse has to be connected to your Raspberry Pi to navigate CarPlay.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440]   Okay.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.440]   So it's a lot of work.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.440]   It's not.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.440]   It's not.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440]   It's a part.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440]   You win the bar bet.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.800]   You win the $20, but then it probably won't do it again.
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:56.120]   It's easier to get doom running on this to get CarPlay.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.680]   It's an in-car in-app purchase.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:03.440]   I have to say, CarPlay is going less than 30 miles an hour before the driver plays.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.960]   I, oh, no.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.240]   That's one of the problems with Tesla.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.800]   You could play video games at any speed.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:13.680]   They get a little heat for that, by the way.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.360]   I do have to admit, I love CarPlay.
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.440]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.080]   I've got wireless CarPlay on my car.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.520]   It works very well.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520]   Nice.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.760]   Very good job on that.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.960]   Do you use the aerial screensaver and your Apple TV?
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.960]   I love it.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:33.480]   In fact, Lisa and I will have a game to identify what it is we're seeing, you know, what city
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.160]   or whatever.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.680]   There is an app for Mac, which I've used for a long time.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:43.920]   It is now updated with the latest TVOS 15 screensavers.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.080]   So if you've been using it.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.240]   They're 95% Dubai now, anyway.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.840]   There's a lot of Dubai.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.240]   There's a lot of Dubai.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.840]   It's pretty from the air.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840]   Yeah, it is.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.200]   It's very pretty.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:58.440]   We do have some more nature stuff in the new aerial screensavers.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:02.760]   There's, I don't know, canyons and mountains and lakes and so forth.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:08.360]   So that's Patagonia, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon in the early ones with helicopters
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.320]   and drones and stuff.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.160]   I really, I run the aerial screensaver.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.160]   I love it.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:16.320]   I just think it's beautiful everywhere I can.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320]   I just love it.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:20.160]   That's super slow-mo.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.280]   And so this is, it's a free app.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:27.640]   I think it's on GitHub, as I remember by John Coates.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:33.080]   I think it's Guillaume Luel, who has updated it to version 2.0.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:36.440]   He is a self-proclaimed sea whiz.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:41.040]   That probably helps.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.680]   Where can we, here it is.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:51.840]   Go to the website, codefi.com aerial 3.0.
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.000]   A couple of picks for you.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.600]   I think this is also probably a Micah Sergeant.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:03.320]   Let us take a little teeny-weeny break and then if you will, gentlemen, prepare your
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.080]   picks of the week for me.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:10.600]   Meanwhile, I'd like to talk about the place I go whenever I get a good idea to get that
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.040]   domain name.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:17.640]   If you're a blogger, if you're an artist, if you're a photographer, if you're a business,
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:22.440]   if you don't have your own custom site, you got to get one.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:27.520]   Having an email at AOL.com just doesn't reflect a professional demeanor.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.820]   Wouldn't you like to have a custom domain to link to your LinkedIn resume or your GitHub
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:35.000]   page or your online store?
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.120]   I think Hover is the best way to do this.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.440]   It's the best domain register I've ever used.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.960]   Email at your domain name, man, that is absolutely a must.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:50.440]   Customers, trust it if your brand is in your email address.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.800]   You have a very affordable, easy to set up choice with Hover.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.680]   They have domain-based emails for all your needs, small or large.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.960]   You can set it up when you register the domain name at Hover.com.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.640]   When your domain renews, your mailboxes renew, you can add as many mailboxes as you
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.120]   want.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.440]   Very affordable price.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.840]   You get web mail if you want it, but you can also use your Apple mail or whatever client
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.360]   you want to download the email.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.520]   Hover is not just a great place to do email.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.880]   It's the best place to register and manage your domain.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.960]   I like to do my own DNS manipulations.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:31.440]   Hover has pro-level tools, both for email and domain management that are intuitive, easy
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.120]   to use, but give me all the capabilities I want.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.600]   They also have a very simple way to connect your Hover domain, your new Hover domain to
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.400]   a website, a blog called Hover Connect.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.880]   Just look for those Hover Connect buttons.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.480]   You pick the service you want to use.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.480]   You press the button.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.480]   Your domain is connected.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.920]   It's as easy as can be.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.600]   I think it's so important.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.560]   Hover doesn't give you all of those pop-ups saying, "Sign up for this, sign up for this,
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560]   sign up for this."
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.560]   When you get a Hover domain name, it's all kind of there.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.800]   The Who Is Privacy Protection is built in.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.640]   It's part of the purchase.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.000]   Your domain information, your registration information is private.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.120]   Reduce spam, protect yourself.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.600]   It's absolutely the way to do it.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.600]   They have all manner.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:22.120]   They have all the domains.com.net.info.co, even.pizza.republican.democrat.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.960]   I have so many crazy domains at Hover.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:26.960]   I use them.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.960]   I use them.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:28.960]   Some of them.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:29.960]   I use them.
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.920]   If you're a customer, you're not a source of data.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:38.320]   Take back control of your data with reliable tracker-free email at a domain name that reflects
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.320]   your brand.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.880]   Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers who use their domain names and
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.640]   email to turn their ideas into a reality.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:51.880]   Developers, photographers, small businesses, Hover has something for you to expand your
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.160]   projects and get the visibility you want.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.160]   Where do you go?
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.160]   Hover hover.com/twit.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:06.280]   You'll get 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension for the entire first year.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.560]   H-O-V-E-R Hover.com/twit.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:13.880]   10% off of any domain extension for a whole year.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.240]   We thank Hover so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.400]   We thank you for supporting it.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.520]   Take advantage of that 10% off your first purchase and let them know you saw it here by
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.760]   going to Hover.com/twit.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.600]   Let's get some picks of the week.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.520]   I will start with Alex Lindsey.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.600]   I'm coming back to something that we talked about earlier.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.400]   We spent a keynote.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.000]   I just want to show something in keynote.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.320]   We spent last Saturday talking about video and keynote and I put together this little
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.320]   demo.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:57.320]   You see it.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:02.320]   You can see that I'm in a little embedded circle in the end.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320]   You're in keynote.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.320]   This is live.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.320]   These are all live.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:12.320]   These are four live sources in keynote.
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.640]   You still have all the things that you have in keynote which is, oh, I'd like to transition.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.640]   This is still in keynote.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.640]   Teachers should be using this.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.640]   Professors.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.160]   We did it in our education hours.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.800]   These are live views.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.320]   I want this to pop out and pop up here.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:36.160]   Then I can still interact with all the things that I have.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:43.200]   All the other things you have in keynote as far as a presentation goes are all still there.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.400]   I didn't think it was that big of a deal when we were like, oh, it's a really cool feature.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.280]   As we started to play with it, it's a game changer.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.920]   It's a game changer.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920]   That's mind-poggling.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920]   Wow.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920]   It is.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:02.160]   So far, in our group, the highest number someone said that they've gotten is eight cameras
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.840]   working inside of the video.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:07.720]   So you're going through an ATEM to get into it?
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:11.360]   No, no, those are here to come back to this.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.480]   I'm going through the ATEM here in the bottom.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.280]   I'm actually splitting my video to the ATEM.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.960]   The other three are web cameras.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.160]   Those are three different web cameras just hooked up to my Mac mini.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.160]   Up to USB.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.160]   Okay.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.800]   So they're just on USB into the thing.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:30.160]   So there's nothing exciting about those.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.760]   I could be on a webcam as well.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:37.280]   So you could have three webcams or four webcams all plugged into a Mac mini.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:46.560]   And literally, if you start using the different keystrokes, I can start jumping to different,
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.920]   I can jump to different cameras.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.920]   You can literally do a switch.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.200]   You can actually switch.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.280]   And you go full screen on anything.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.760]   So you can, I was thinking it'd be great for screen captures or screen shares.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.120]   Yeah, you can totally do it.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.280]   So if I hit, let me go over to the.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.280]   Like if I were going to, like this is OBS Studio, but better in a way.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.040]   Well, I don't know if it's better than OBS Studio.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.160]   It's just different, but it gives you a lot of tools.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.080]   The main thing is, is that you have all the tools that you have as keynotes.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.080]   So you're in here.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.120]   It's like, you know, you're just moving your video around.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.560]   But that's a video frame, you know, and it's, and it's just powerful.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.320]   Is your latency is it pretty quick?
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   The latency is almost zero.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.320]   Wow.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   I mean, you can see me in the corner.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320]   I'm up here.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.320]   So if I go, no, it's really good.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.800]   You know, and so the latency is very low.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.800]   It's in it.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:33.920]   And, and so you have, you know, you can definitely go full screen.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:39.560]   I mean, this is so if I just built another, like if I, you know, copy this, just copy
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.560]   this.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.560]   How do you get the camera?
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.600]   Is there just an embed camera?
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.560]   You basically, if you want to add a new one, you just go to media.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.280]   You go down to live video.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]   Oh my God.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   There's as easy as be.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:53.040]   And then you say, and if you want.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.720]   So that's really nice.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.720]   That's really nice.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.720]   Oh, teachers should be.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:57.720]   I just turned the camera off.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.440]   Teachers should totally be using this.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:05.080]   But even like I'm thinking of, you know, screencasts online and stuff like that, you could make,
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.960]   you could record it and make a screencast very nicely, I think.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.720]   That's the, that's what, one of the folks, if you look at our Saturday office hours that,
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:18.240]   we did with educators, that's exactly what was done is they put together an entire video.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:26.200]   And that's the, that's the secret to this is that, is it really keynote is the, is the
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.400]   easiest, like I want to build a video for my class, for my company, for whatever.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.720]   I don't know how to use motion or final cut or eye movie or any of these other apps.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.640]   I just want to throw together videos and you can, you can totally just throw it in.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.200]   Can you do screen capture too?
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.600]   Could I have a live screen?
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.600]   So you can, oh, yes.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.720]   You can, you'd have to, to do a live screen, you would need it to go to, that's the, you'd
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:51.720]   have to go out.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:55.400]   So this is the one thing that isn't working right now is that there's no way to take
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:02.280]   virtual cameras and put them in, but you could, you can share your Apple TV as a source.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.040]   You can also, you know, so you can share an Apple TV.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.040]   No, I see.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.400]   And then you'd live live.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.400]   Live.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.400]   Airplay.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   Airplay it.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.640]   And then you have it.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.680]   You'd need to consider so because the keynote would be, oh, I guess you got to be on the
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.680]   second screen.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.680]   I mean, what I'm using is to, I mean, like to do screens.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.720]   I'm doing three or Mac minis.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.920]   And this, well, this one, so this one's the presentation Mac mini.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:30.000]   The other one is the, this is the one that does a telestrator is my other Mac mini.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   And then I just have a work one.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.800]   What software to use for the telestrator?
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   I made it.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.320]   So anyway, so anyway, yeah.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.600]   So this is, this is my, my telestrator software.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.160]   So that's really good.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:44.240]   Anyway, would you make that Xcode?
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.080]   So I didn't, I didn't write it.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:49.080]   I designed it.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:52.400]   I, I, a friend of mine is really smart.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.920]   So really smart.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.400]   Mark Granger put it together for me.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:56.400]   Nice.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.000]   Are you ever going to let any of anybody have that?
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.880]   I am trying to, I, you know, here's the problem is that the person who wrote it for me, you
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:09.840]   know, wrote it over like a weekend and then, and then got a job and then that's it's complicated
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:10.840]   if he finishes it.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.200]   I'm trying to find, if you're out there, you can contact me.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.360]   I'm trying to find a good program, or the one still like, please.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]   It's not in Swift.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.200]   I want to, I want to update it and make sure the, my, my big thing is I don't want to put
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.760]   out an app that people, you know, like it works for me, but it crashes.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.760]   It needs to be Swift too.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.760]   It does it.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.640]   Well, but it crashes every once in a while and does a bunch of weird things.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.720]   And, and so I, it works for me all the, you know, for me, but I, I would want to sit down
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.880]   and develop the app before I put it.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:39.080]   I don't want a bunch of one stars of like, it crashed, you know, like I was like, you know,
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:45.080]   it's, it's, you know, so anyway, so I, um, uh, I do plan, I have a whole line of apps
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.080]   that I'm working on right now.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.080]   I'm so ADD.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.400]   I think I, oh, I should really learn Swift.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.400]   I should really learn.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.400]   I mean, it's just, it's hopeless.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.040]   It's one of those years is what I need.
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.360]   I keep on thinking that I'm going to take like a couple months off and do, you know,
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.400]   coding with Chris and, and do, you know, kind of walk through the videos and I get through
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:06.480]   a couple of them and I, I start to get my head around it and, and then I just get busy
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.480]   again.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.480]   I get paid to do.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.480]   That's me too.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480]   Very nice.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.480]   Very cool.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480]   I'm going to have to start playing with that.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.480]   That's pretty cool.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:21.280]   It's super, like if you're, if you're a, if you're presenting, it's, it is, it, I mean,
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.000]   all of keynote is really good, but the live video now means that you can do, you can finally
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.160]   do those presentations that, you know, you don't want to be having someone watch the slide
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   the whole time.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.360]   It can be your webcam or if you're a teacher, you can have your webcam and you can have an
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.840]   overhead webcam, you know, that's looking down at something that you're, that you're
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.720]   talking about, you know, that type of thing.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.000]   So, and then you can keep on cutting to, you know, videos and everything else.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.600]   So you have all the access to all the different media that you have.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.680]   And, and I think that it's just a really, you know, overlooked.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.160]   I mean, I, I've had this discussion before, but it's someone asked like, what app has
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.800]   made you the most money in the last 20 years?
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.200]   I was like keynote, keynote has made the most money by far, like millions, you know, like
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.040]   not me millions, but companies that I work for, you know, it's made the millions because
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.200]   it's, you know, it's the, it's how you pitch and it's how you talk about things and how
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.440]   you even just illustrate how we're going to do this project, you know.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.360]   So it's, it's really powerful in the live video.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.240]   It just really takes it to a whole other level.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:12.240]   Nice.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.240]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.640]   So this is an oldie, but a goodie.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.560]   It's Neil Seibart's above Avalon.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:22.080]   Oh, Neil Seibart is not familiar with him.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.280]   He was a former sell side analyst.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.680]   I think he used to post his Sammy the Walrus back in the day.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:31.680]   But since going independent, he's full in on being Neil Seibart.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:39.400]   And above Avalon, it's very different than like Stretecherie from Ben Thompson, where
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.960]   he just focuses on Apple.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.360]   But he really digs deep.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:48.640]   He's one of the most accurate Apple analysts out there in terms of like if you're interested
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.400]   in the stock or where he thinks it's moving and how the businesses are doing, very accurate
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.400]   in terms of predictions.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.040]   You often poo poo is the outrageous outlandish numbers.
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:01.320]   You hear for sales and gives you much, much more down to earth, much more accurate numbers.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:06.280]   But he also, I love that he per he prosecutes a lot of the sensational articles that we
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.240]   see like something will come out and he'll dig into it and he'll say, wait, there's actually
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.240]   no source for this.
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:13.120]   They're quoting this person is quoting them.
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:17.720]   You know, it's like a circle quoting at a certain point.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.200]   And he does this daily newsletter.
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.200]   You subscribe to it.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.480]   He also does it in podcast form.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:29.680]   And he just he really gives very deep analysis around everything that involves Apple as
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.760]   a like, you know, a for profit company.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.960]   It's not going to be for everyone.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.760]   But if that kind of stuff is really interesting to you, especially if you're, if you look
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.160]   at Apple from like a financial point of view, it's just the best thing out there.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:44.400]   I read it every day and it's it's tremendously valuable to me.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.920]   Add it to your RSS feeds.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.240]   Put it in your Google reader.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.840]   Yeah, I completely agree with you.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:59.720]   You'll sidebar it above Avalon.com. Thank you, Renee, Annie and I co-pick of the week.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:02.560]   One quick one and that's really important and one.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560]   Wow.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.560]   Why my so blurry?
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.320]   Well, probably should switch to section.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.320]   It's actually good.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.380]   Your skin has never looked finer.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.380]   It's the Streisand.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.400]   It was original wonder for the Internet.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:19.700]   So the United States government opened up its free COVID test kits for everybody program
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:20.700]   a day early.
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:25.740]   So if you go to covatest.gov, they will give them your name and address and they will mail
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.820]   you a four pack of rapid tests.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.660]   You don't even have to pay for postage.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:35.900]   And I you would expect that the news would be, wow, like went online like three or four
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.900]   hours ago.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.220]   And now of course, instead, no, I went online just before the show and it worked just fine.
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:45.060]   And then I just even just tested it like five minutes ago and the site is still responsive.
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:46.860]   So for some reason, we go.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:51.020]   The government websites actually working indeed.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:56.620]   So again, every, every, I don't know if four test kits is going to be as useful as possible
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:02.420]   for a household with like two like my hover email, unfortunately, because it's a dot email
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:03.420]   address.
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:06.180]   But other than that, thank you, US government.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.860]   Get the US digital services on that one.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:10.860]   But thank you.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:11.860]   Wow.
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:12.860]   Excellent.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:13.860]   Yep.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:18.180]   I'm sure you want the COVID test kit like there when you need it like again, when you want
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:20.180]   to go to store to get one.
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:25.540]   I mean, it's like I mentioned this before, like a few months ago, I lost one of my elderly
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:28.980]   aunts and it was a real struggle to decide that is it?
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.980]   Oh, is it?
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:31.980]   I mean, she was she was wonderful.
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:32.980]   I really did.
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:36.260]   I really did want to attend the wake, but it was like all of her friends are also going to
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:39.180]   be in their like 70s, 80s, 90s.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:42.500]   Should I should I go even with a mask on?
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:48.260]   And will I introduce if I am asymptomatic had I had this was before like these at home
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:53.060]   test kits were available, I might have taken the risk with some other mitigations if I
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.900]   been able to take a rapid test like three or four hours before considering leaving and
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.260]   if that turned out negative, I think I wouldn't have I would have also done other medications,
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:05.460]   but this is these reasons why it's good to have this just standing by for that moment
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:09.820]   when before you go to a party before you go to an event, we think it's okay, but maybe
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.140]   I should just test anyway.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:15.140]   But again, as you said, it's people most of the message traffic about this online is
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.740]   like, Oh my God, the site is actually working on it.
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.740]   It gave me confirmation.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.740]   It was very easy.
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:21.860]   I didn't have to ask me to authentic value.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:22.860]   It was great.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.860]   It was instant.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:25.860]   Very nice.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:28.700]   But that's one free thing.
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:34.780]   The other one is also free, although I did a buy a coffee thing for the developer.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:41.540]   It's a plugin for every popular browser except for Safari that adds multi select functions
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:43.220]   to the YouTube interface.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:47.660]   So my problem was that I've been a YouTube user since like, you know, shortly after it
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:51.660]   launched and you know how it happens where you have the watch later button where you're
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.700]   scrolling, you're on Reddit or whatever you see.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:56.140]   Oh, I think I'd like to see that later, but not right now.
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:49:02.220]   So easy peasy is click on the watch later button and after like 10, 15 years of this,
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:07.580]   you always add stuff faster than you watch it and you watch stuff faster than you delete
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.060]   stuff from watch later.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:15.100]   So I quickly hit my 5000 video limit and was like for like the past like eight, nine months,
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:18.860]   I couldn't add more stuff until I go on my phone or something and just like manually
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:24.420]   delete like a hundred, a hundred videos from watch later because it doesn't, the interface
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.420]   doesn't have a select all or multi select.
[01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:31.980]   This one just installed the plugin and suddenly just anytime you access YouTube, now there's
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:36.940]   a checkbox and another little like three dot menu, like next to each item and just click
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:37.940]   on this.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:41.820]   So yes, please select all the select all will affect all of the videos that are inside
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:43.980]   the window at this time.
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:47.940]   So if you have a scrolling list, like the user interface will have like preloaded like
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:52.420]   a hundred videos, so it'll only select a hundred, but that meant that I could get from 5000,
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:58.020]   5000 videos copied into a backup playlist and like five or 10 minutes and suddenly after
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.260]   a year or so this big problem have been solved.
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:04.860]   I don't know why YouTube does not support multiple selection or even a select all.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:08.060]   Oh, well, but this is it's it's really updated.
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.500]   It has a lot of a lot of reviews.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.340]   So it's not just stealing your data, but not just stealing your data.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.540]   Well, maybe if it's stealing your data, it's also doing something valuable.
[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:19.900]   But I quickly as soon as I solve this problem, like, Oh my God, I yes, sir, I will buy you
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:20.900]   a coffee.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:21.900]   I will buy you multiple coffees.
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.820]   Thank you for solving this problem for me.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.340]   I just went to thanks to scooter X to analytics.
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:31.420]   USA got gov that shows the traffic to US government websites.
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:35.140]   There are 1.6 million people on government websites now.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:39.380]   1.3 million of them are on the free COVID home test.
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:44.140]   So well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well done.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:50.140]   I know Matt cuts isn't at the USDS anymore, but boy, that's a hell of a hell of a job.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.540]   You compare that to the Obamacare site when it launched a few years ago.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.620]   By the way, that's why US digital services exists.
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:01.900]   USDS exists because they wanted to help with the ACA website.
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.220]   And now they've done such a great job.
[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.420]   And I have to think they might have a little bit to do with this.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:11.980]   Postal services like the top four websites out of this.
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:13.820]   And it's like six out of the top 10.
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.820]   It's really big.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:19.420]   Yeah, I actually kind of liked how integrated it was.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:23.140]   You place your order that gives you a nice, nice postal service confirmation.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.980]   It wasn't as though they have to, oh, well, here's something that if you want to plug this
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.100]   into another site, it's almost as though the postal service and this website were being
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:33.020]   operated by the same bureaucracy.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.020]   Incredible.
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.820]   This is actually a great page, too.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.460]   Thank you for this page.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:43.700]   Almost half of the browsers are Chrome, but 35% Safari.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.140]   It's analytics.usa.gov.
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.140]   And it's real time.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.460]   It gets updated.
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.260]   It's amazing.
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:57.020]   Firefox is a small and Samsung internet, but Safari is 35% of the visitors.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.780]   More than half on mobile.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:05.380]   iOS, 34% of all visits are iOS, 31% Windows.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:11.020]   Well, also, you know what this is giving us another insight that what is that what kind
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:15.580]   of computers and operating systems and devices are used by people who actually believe that
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:20.140]   COVID is a thing and that self testing would be a useful thing for their lives and other
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:21.140]   people's lives.
[01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:27.180]   It's possible this is not just a look at the disparity between different operating systems.
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:35.100]   What percentage of the internet that accesses is like espn.com?
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   Does this reflect the same thing or is this data going to give us insights into what kind
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.820]   of devices are owned by people who deny COVID?
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:44.980]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:47.540]   That's a lot of business.
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:48.940]   It's really well designed.
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:49.940]   Is this a good site?
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.540]   I bet you USDS on this one as well.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.540]   Wow.
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:57.220]   No, it's the GSA.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:01.940]   Analytics.usa.gov is a product of the GSA's digital analytics program.
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.380]   It's hosted on cloud.gov.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.380]   Wow.
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:12.180]   This was a big and this is a expression of a big initiative during I think the digital.gov
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.180]   initiative.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:15.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:18.860]   Meaning specifically, we want to make government data and government resources more available
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:23.940]   and it wasn't just, oh, well, we'll have a place we can download tax forms more easily.
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:28.300]   It was no, it's also useful to create an analytics page like this so people can have
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:30.500]   access to the same data the government has seen.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:34.060]   Well, and this is a really good example of why you need something like this, this COVID
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:35.060]   home tests.
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.500]   I mean, talk, I mean, right away, really good, very nice.
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.740]   Thank you for that tip of the week I've ordered for.
[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:45.540]   Hoping I never have to use them.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:47.620]   I don't, John wants to know what the expiration date is.
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:48.620]   I don't know.
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:49.700]   We'll find out when we get them, I guess.
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:52.980]   I got well, I actually I did a having electrician come over tomorrow.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:54.660]   So I actually took a rapid test today.
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:58.060]   I probably should have done it like three hours beforehand, but whatever.
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:01.420]   And they're good for about till the end of the year, I think.
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:06.140]   I think the fresh, the freshness date on the kit that I opened was like at the very end
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:07.140]   of 2020.
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.140]   Okay.
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:09.140]   Okay.
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.700]   By then we won't need them anymore.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.700]   Of course.
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:13.700]   Thank you, Annie.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.220]   What are you going to be on GBH next?
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:20.060]   The usual time, 12, 13, the afternoon on Friday.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:24.620]   Just go to WGBHNews.org to listen to it, stream it live or later.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:25.620]   Thank you.
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:27.260]   Always a pleasure.
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.820]   Rum's legs master Alex Lindsey.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:30.820]   We got a bike.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:32.500]   We saw that you have a rum's leg cam.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.500]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.500]   I do.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.500]   I do, yeah.
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:37.500]   Almost hours.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.500]   Doc Global.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.740]   What is the mic you're using?
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:42.340]   This is a Neumann TLM 102.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:43.340]   Do you like it?
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:44.340]   Because it works.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.340]   Really?
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:46.340]   Yeah, it sounds great.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:49.260]   But it's really, really, really expensive.
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:50.780]   It's not, I mean, it's expensive.
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:51.780]   It's not really, really expensive.
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:54.820]   I mean, in the mic world, it's not really, really expensive.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:59.620]   The 103 is really, anything over a thousand dollars ago, that's really expensive.
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:01.380]   This is about $600 I think.
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:02.380]   So that's not awful.
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.380]   650.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.380]   Yeah, it's not awful.
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:07.180]   It's a, and I think it's not a USB mic.
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.780]   I mean, obviously you have a mixer.
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.340]   No, no, this is going through, yeah.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:14.180]   This is going through sound devices and then it's got noise assist because otherwise you
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.700]   would hear all the fans and everything.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:20.200]   Because it's, the problem really with it is that I've had to rebuild everything around
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:24.740]   me to use it because it, it's off at, you know, the off axis rejection on the PR 40 is
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:25.740]   great.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:27.180]   You know, this is sounds better.
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:29.940]   I feel like I got more high end, but it is.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:30.940]   Yeah, it's a condenser.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:33.900]   So it's got, you know, but it picks up, yeah, it picks up many things.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.900]   That's the problem.
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:39.700]   So it, so you, so I'm constantly, I had to get a mute and then I have a lot of time to
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:42.580]   move away from the mouse and use my a trackpad.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:45.940]   And then I just have to be conscious of what I'm, you know, what's making noise.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:46.940]   Right.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.940]   It's not.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.940]   So it's, it's, I, you know, it's one of those things that I.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.900]   It's for a sound, a soundproof studio.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:51.900]   It's for a real.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:52.900]   It is.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.340]   And so I'm, but I've been using it for the last couple of weeks and I'm pretty happy
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:56:00.580]   with the, with the, I'm even using an office hours and I got so many positive things.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:02.580]   I think so.
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:07.980]   So yeah, but, yeah, I might, I should play with one of these, but I have a feeling.
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:08.980]   They're really nice.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:11.500]   You have a hard time using it in the studio because you're doing a lot of moving parts,
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:14.380]   but at home, it's, this is my, I've had this for years.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.380]   So I didn't buy it.
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.300]   I mean, I bought it, but I didn't buy it recently.
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:20.540]   I have, I've had it for maybe almost a decade of, as my voice over Mike.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.100]   Some people asked me to do a voiceover for us.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.100]   Perfect.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:24.300]   I used, I used this mic.
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:30.780]   And then I, and so, but, but it's very unforgiving when it comes to everything around you.
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:35.820]   So it's, someone, my cat jumped up on, on me on during the show and you could hear it.
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.820]   People were like, I can hear it purring.
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:38.820]   You know, so it's, so it's.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.820]   So it's, it's, it's.
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:43.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:44.820]   No, absolutely.
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:46.820]   Beautiful NPR sound.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:48.820]   Oh, natural.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:51.020]   Oh, natural.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.020]   Thank you, Alex.

[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:55.420]   What are you working on?
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:59.740]   Oh, I just did like that incredibly long video going through the history of lightning
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:05.340]   and USB-C and A, the aging out of various connectors and where we could go from here.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.420]   So if you want to see why I didn't sleep much in the last two days.

[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:36.100]   Oh, I didn't think of that.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:38.100]   I'm going to get you.

[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:19.620]   I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.620]   Bye bye.
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:24.860]   Have you ever read a tech news story and thought to yourself man I would love to talk to the
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.180]   person who wrote this to find out more information.
