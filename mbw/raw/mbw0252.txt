[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.240]   it isn't usual because you travel so much.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.160]   We've missed you.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.760]   Sorry.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   Alex Lindsey in studio.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.200]   That's the kid.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.640]   From thepixelcourt.com.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.880]   And pixacore.tv for the miss.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.800]   I was with Andy last week.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.400]   It was very fun.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.960]   I know that was kind of cute.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.560]   It was really cute.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.640]   Andy Nacos also here with winged virtue,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520]   or winged somebody.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.640]   That is the bread upon the water's statue
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.800]   from the public garden made by the same dude who
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.040]   did the Lincoln Memorial and so many other really cool sculptures.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.960]   Andy is giving us a tour of Baston in his rear view mirror.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.440]   Exactly.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.280]   A lifetime experience live from your armchair.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   Stay tuned for the URL and purchasing.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   And joining us right now in studio--
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.040]   I'm so thrilled to have the editor-in-chief of Macworld
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.680]   magazine, Jason Snell here.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.880]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.000]   And it's great to be here when there
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.640]   are other people in the building, which--
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.440]   Lots.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.160]   It's great.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.440]   I was the only man in the studio the last two times I was here.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.000]   You notice this is a little sweaty now with all these people
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.440]   in here.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   Yeah, it's warm.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.320]   Little muggy.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.800]   I got in--
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.960]   You're going to see the room over here.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.400]   --to a larger studio.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.680]   Yeah, right over here.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.280]   This is the last few-- the waning weeks of Hitler's bunker.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.920]   As I lovingly know the cottage.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.440]   Don't mention the war.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   And all of you will be coming with me down the road
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240]   to the new place, which is getting very close to being
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.760]   a fish.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.680]   I've been gone for a week.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.640]   I'm very excited to see the--
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520]   Yeah, we put the furniture in.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.960]   You can see it a little bit on the drop cam, which is
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   bit.ly/twitdrop if you want to see it.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   But the furniture is in.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.160]   The lighting is starting to go in.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   The cameras are here.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.200]   We're waiting for the lighting that Brent's using for that.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.360]   He's great.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.080]   Bread by.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.800]   He's got some skills.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.680]   OceanMedia.com is doing our lighting and doing a great job.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.080]   And then I think we're going to move in three or four weeks.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440]   Depends on how long it takes us to get the audio and video
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.240]   working.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.520]   You saw how long it took us to get the audio working in this room.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.840]   And this is simple.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.360]   So we have a ways to go.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.560]   But it'll be exciting.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.200]   It'll be exciting.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400]   So the big news this morning, I gets up.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.480]   And look, lo and behold, it's Final Cut Studio X10.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.040]   It's out.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.560]   It's out.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.600]   Did you know it would be today?
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.280]   Or is that a shock to everybody?
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   I knew.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.960]   How did you know, Jesus, now?
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   We have our ways.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.680]   We had a writer who actually has it.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.200]   And he's got a first look up on knackell.com.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.720]   Oh, already?
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   We flew him to New York for a briefing.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.240]   And he's a professional editor.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.040]   And the review is coming too.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.640]   But yeah, it's scary.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.240]   Gary, Gary, I can't get it.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.520]   It's really different, though.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.080]   I mean, it is Final Cut Pro X10 version 1.0.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.600]   It's not Final Cut Pro 10.0.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.520]   It's a new Final Cut.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.760]   I hesitate to do this, but it's a little bit
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   like what they did with iMovie in the sense--
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   That's the nearest people in the sense.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.600]   I know.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.280]   In the sense that it's the same name,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.120]   but it really is a rethink of the product.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.620]   Right.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.360]   And I think there'll be a lot of people who are--
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.760]   So I downloaded it this morning twice.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.960]   So I downloaded it in all three machines at home.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.460]   I know.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.160]   Is there a limit to how many times you could download it?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.960]   I think it's five.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.280]   I think it's a standard Mac app.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.480]   It's a standard Mac application.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.680]   Mac App Store app.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760]   Yeah, I think you can put it anywhere,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.680]   but there's a license.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.080]   The Pro app license on the Mac App Store is a one-to-one,
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.840]   I believe.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.440]   Consumer app is not.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.040]   It's weird.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.600]   It's very hidden in the user-frame.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.840]   So I might only be able to install it on one machine.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.400]   Well, no, I think you can install it on many machines.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.560]   I think the license is for one.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.240]   So I'd be violating my--
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.740]   Right.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.200]   But with most of this Apple stuff,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.840]   it's largely on our system.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.640]   Right.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.680]   But I downloaded it on my laptop and on my home computer
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.280]   and started to noodle with it.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.920]   I did not have a preview copy.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.280]   And it is a very, very different.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.320]   It's very fast.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.560]   You could tell that they really focused on interactivity
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.000]   and being able to do this.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.360]   When you say fast, what machine are you running Final Cut Pro
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.000]   X?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.640]   I was running it on the 17-inch laptop.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.520]   I have a Mac Pro with i7s and i5s.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.000]   I think it's i5s.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.280]   It's like the 16-core with--
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.520]   OK, so it's fast.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.360]   What a surprise.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.680]   No, but it's faster than the old one.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.720]   It's faster than the old one.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.280]   It's a very different interface.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.000]   It is a complete rethink.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480]   So you have Final Cut and then you have Motion.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   Motion is separate.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.720]   OK, so not only is it separate.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.360]   It's $50.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   It's $50.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.120]   I mean, that's one quarter of the price
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.720]   that they were charging before.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.320]   And 200 bucks was considered an amazing deal.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.960]   Well, so it's $300 for Final Cut.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   And then it's $50 for Motion.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.400]   And I think is it $50 for Compressor?
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   $50 for Compressor.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.760]   Compressor, yeah.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   Which hasn't really changed.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.320]   I mean, Compressor, the new--
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.760]   when you're monitoring your compressions,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.720]   that looks different.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.440]   I don't think anything about Compressor has changed.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640]   I think they just kind of published it.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.480]   But one of the interesting things, though,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   is that the way they're managing-- and I think this
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.800]   is going to be something that we're
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.600]   going to be excited about playing with--
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.960]   is that the way they manage plugins has changed completely.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.880]   So what you're doing now is that you--
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.600]   the plugins-- 95% of the plugins that are in Final Cut--
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.800]   are actually motion projects.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.240]   So these are actually--
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.960]   so that you actually source the plugin architecture in Motion.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.240]   And then you actually use it in Final Cut.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.160]   Now, that may seem like a little roundabout.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.520]   But what it means now is that a user can actually develop
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.240]   kind of their own plugins.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.480]   And then basically publish those.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.240]   And it kind of in the way that we set up motion projects
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.840]   before as templates for Final Cut,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.800]   but in a much more clean way from one to the other.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.680]   And I think that that's going to be a really interesting
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.120]   process.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.800]   I mean, if you're buying the new Final Cut,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.600]   I think you're going to end up buying--
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.960]   you can buy all three.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.240]   And just motion by itself.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.000]   $50.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.320]   If you want to do motion graphics--
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.760]   So you don't need Final Cut X to do--
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.040]   you could just run-- you could buy motion for $50
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.400]   and be just producing great little commercials,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.720]   great training products, great--
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.880]   I mean, it hasn't changed much at all.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.520]   Other than it looking like a dark gray interface,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.120]   I think motion is almost--
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.640]   So the field's very, very small.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.640]   Final Cut Pro X is now 64-bit throughout.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   Yes.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.760]   64-bit.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.080]   Yep.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.640]   It is Coco 100% Coco.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.560]   Yes.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.040]   Yes.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.680]   Far as we can tell.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.400]   Far as we can.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.720]   Uses the GPU.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.320]   That's good news, heavily.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.360]   But it's new.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.680]   And let's be clear.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.120]   If you're UI.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.920]   Well, and I believe it doesn't import Final Cut 7 project.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.360]   You can't project.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.920]   You're not.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.420]   What?
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.440]   Hold on there.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.320]   So we're going to have a--
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   It's a schism.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.320]   It is a product schism.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.560]   So you're going to have people using Final Cut Pro 7
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.640]   for years now saying, I can't go to 10.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.280]   And I think--
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.600]   Well, I think you're also going to have a lot of people
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   who are going to premiere an app.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.560]   Absolutely.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.120]   I think Apple was going to--
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.040]   I think that they're going to double their installed base
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.960]   with this product.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.320]   But I think it's also going to lose the high end.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.760]   I think they're going to--
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.240]   they're jettisoning the very high end.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.160]   So you're saying Walter Murch from now on
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.360]   is going to use premiere?
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.280]   The movie studios use premiere?
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.680]   Or they'll stay with Final Cut 7?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.160]   What I really want to see is what Walter Murch actually does.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.720]   You know, because he may want to prove something with this.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.800]   But I think that in the current version,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.720]   you don't have the level of control and interaction
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.640]   with other applications.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.800]   The XML, a lot of the publishing stuff that's out there.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   That's interesting.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.680]   You're not going to have the things
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   that you're going to want in a large pipeline.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.840]   I think this is a big opportunity for Adobe and Avid.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.320]   Although I do think that this will be a very, very successful
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   product for Apple.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   I think they're massively successful.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   But I think it opens up new market.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   You're going to have disaffected existing customers.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   But you're going to have new customers.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.320]   I mean, when you see what the outrage was when iMovie was
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   rethought, right?
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   A lot of those people were people who were pushing iMovie
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   to the limits.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   Right.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   And those people are going to start looking at this new Final Cut
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.320]   and say, oh, you know, this is what we're going for.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   All those people are like, oh, iMovie isn't advanced enough.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   But I don't want to use Final Cut Express.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   You know, this is sort of that product for them, which means
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   they're going to say goodbye to a lot of people on the high end.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   And I think that from a business perspective, I think it totally
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   makes sense for Apple.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   I think that it is a very seamless conversion.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   All these people that get iMovie for free.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   This is a very seamless upgrade.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   I think the one that the little hiccup wrote.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   I'm excited because I'm a Final Cut Express user/iMovie user.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   So for me, this is exactly right.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   Right.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   Now, the one thing I will talk to you--
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   And it imports from iMovie, right?
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   It does.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   It does.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   It does.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   It does.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   It does.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   It does.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   Ironically, it imports from iMovie.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   Yeah, both the same infrastructure.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   I mean, it's clear that this is--
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   So this is really iMovie on steroids.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   They really don't want you to think of it that way.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   That's very interesting.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   That's what it is.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   I mean, it's pretty close.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   And it's got a lot more tools than iMovie.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   I mean, you know, the--
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   Now, one thing is that when you look at the prices, someone might be tempted to say,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   I'm going from iMovie and then I'll buy the next expensive one, which is Motion,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   and then I'll go to Final Cut.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   Motion is still way more complicated than Final Cut for a lot of people.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320]   So that's a--
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   It's a heavier thing.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.720]   It is extremely powerful, and it's probably at $50 the most powerful app you can get for
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   Motion Graphics.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   I mean, if you want to be adding stuff and creating stuff, you definitely want to learn
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   that.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   So, um--
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   It's just a--
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.360]   It's not what's needed by After Effects for him.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.320]   Should I just say, screw it, use Motion?
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   It's the same thing?
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.800]   It really depends on what you want to do.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   I think that--
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.160]   You want us to create 3D graphics with Motion's 2D, right?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   No, it does.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   It does 2D cards.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   It does 2D cards.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   It's 2 and 1/2D.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   It'll do 2D cards.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   It doesn't--
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.160]   You can't bring in 3D models necessarily into it, but you can do 3D moves.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   I--
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.760]   In the chatroom, BurnZ TV is saying, "Wow, better than iMovie."
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.760]   Quite the tagline.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.920]   Apple-- that's why Apple doesn't want to have the word "iMovie" come up.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.440]   But it's the first word that comes up when you launch Final Cut Pro X studio Xtreme.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.960]   It says, "Would you like to import an iMovie?"
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   That's the first thing you see.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.040]   Well, and I think that it's-- again, I always-- I mean, I've said this before on the show
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.080]   is that Apple is a 90-90 company.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   What will 90% of people need 90% of the time?
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.880]   And they solve that really, really well.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.080]   And I think this solves that problem really well.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   Yes, I know.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.520]   If you are a teacher, if you are in corporate communication, if you are in news broadcasting,
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   I mean, I think the speed that you're going to be able to work at this--
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   We'll use it for sure.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   I'll work at it.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   It's exactly what we need.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.520]   And so--
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.520]   And Apple is willing--
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.520]   And Apple's willing--
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   And you want to slice and dice that.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Right.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.760]   If you're at the super high end, we just don't-- we don't have the time and the effort to
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   do that.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   And we don't want to be in that business anymore.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.280]   It's funny because they have the hardware in some ways.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.960]   I mean, you know, I would imagine people like Walter Merch would like to use Mac Pros.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   We'd like to use the--
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   Wow.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   I guess you get a PC.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   Well, I think--
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.440]   But even there, you look at the evolution of the iMac and the Mac Pro.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.560]   I mean, the Mac Pro is narrower and narrower and narrower as it goes to.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   That's true.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   Right.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560]   That's true.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   1.43 gigabytes.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.360]   I'm downloading it right now onto my fourth--
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   Install.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   We'll see.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.920]   Is it-- it's some quick going to say, no, you've installed it too many times?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.440]   You know, I've only had five machines on my-- on my--
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   I'm not installing--
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.520]   I just have this thing like-- I don't know.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   I don't always work.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.840]   I don't believe any of the Mac App Store stuff actually does checking.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   Right.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   There are the two different licenses.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.800]   And I think it's all of the Macs in your household for consumer apps or all the Macs
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   that you have.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.040]   And it's very broad.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.600]   And then for Pro apps, I think the license specifies it's one to one.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.680]   But again, it's an honor system thing.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   An Apple doesn't.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   And there is that iTunes limit as Locke is pointing out in the chat room that you can
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   only activate--
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   Yeah, but that's not-- that's from the App Store.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   That's not for the App Store.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.760]   Yeah, it does not check for the App Store.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.760]   OK.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   So that's not going to--
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.000]   And this is something-- and this is the kind of thing that only Apple can do because
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.480]   you're-- because essentially, you know, they're a hardware company.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.400]   You know, they can say, you know, we're going to make it really easy to move this stuff
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.880]   around and people will do it.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.920]   You know, so I think that it-- but you do have to have the same credential on all the
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   same machines, of course.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   You know, that's the--
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   Right, right.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.240]   You have to have your username and password, which is the kind of soft copy protection
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.720]   that's basically you need to trust whoever's using that system to have your iTunes account,
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.960]   which is linked to your credit card.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   Right.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   So it's not going to be something you're going to see in ABC.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.040]   Do you have anything to add to this-- Andy and Akos, you're sitting there quietly contemplating
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   his naval?
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   No, well, because I realized that we have Alex Lindsay in front of us.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.320]   When-- what I-- I have a couple of questions really there for him that my-- I was already
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   asking him a couple questions this morning.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   Go ahead.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:37.400]   No, no, it's just that there's such a split between the pro user apps and even the semi-pro,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.200]   even the like the amateurs with incredible talent and ambition and time market, where
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.920]   you have folks who are willing to spend $1,000, $2,000 per seat on a solution because they're
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.160]   transacting like a $40,000 or $50,000 contract to do it.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.760]   So it's always interesting to me to find out from folks like Alex how much loyalty is there
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.520]   going to be to Final Cut?
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.960]   If there-- if you've got an-- if you've got a house that's cutting like all their internal
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.480]   videos with Final Cut and they're-- they do a lot of churn on those videos.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   It's like it's not just, oh, every three months they decide to do a birthday party.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.360]   It's, no, they need to do all the training for 500 people in a company all through this
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   suite.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   Is it going to be to simply get this person to switch from Final Cut to anything else?
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.600]   But this itself is switch, right?
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.280]   There's a fundamental switch from Final Cut to Final Cut.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.280]   Sorry, Alex, tell us.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.520]   But no, I just-- I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.760]   It's got the same name, that's it.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.800]   This is-- and I think we're going to see a lot of PR from Abbott and Adobe and everyone
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.560]   else because this is their moment where everyone goes, I don't know how to use the
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   next version.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.880]   And now it's an even playing field and we're going to look at all these things.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:50.680]   Now I think that if you're looking at Fast and Furious, if you're building possibly independent
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.920]   short films, corporate, education, you're doing a lot of these things that need to be
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.560]   cut quickly, cut at a budget, you're never going to-- I mean, the quality and speed you're
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.200]   going to get with Final Cut, in my opinion.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.320]   And I think that you're going to want us to look very, very seriously at this.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   I've never really considered Final Cut to be.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.520]   I've always been kind of surprised when someone does a whole feature film in Final Cut.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   Really?
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.720]   I've never felt like it really manages large--
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.680]   What would you do it in?
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.280]   If I was going to do a full feature film, I would do it in a media composer.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.200]   I'd still do it in Abbott.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   So because it can handle the libraries, the multiple clips?
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.040]   Hundreds of thousands of our-- the thing is when we're doing web stuff or when we're
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.280]   doing this stuff, we're thinking about, oh, I've got two or three hundred objects or
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.880]   I've got a thousand objects.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.880]   And I think that Final Cut--
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   In our case three.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   But OK.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.800]   When you're working on an Abbott, you're thinking about tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.440]   of-- I've worked in projects where we had over half a million objects in the project.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   Right.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   And this was 10 years ago.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.640]   So the thing is, Abbott manages that much more effectively.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.560]   I think that Premiere, if you're looking for integrated solutions with-- I think the
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.240]   red integration is really, really good.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.080]   I think the integration between-- if you're using After Effects heavily, then Premiere
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.240]   is the answer to do a lot of that stuff.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.800]   Because the integration between those two applications, between all the Adobe applications,
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.480]   is pretty astounding.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.040]   So I think that those are all solutions to look at.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.800]   I think that Final Cut, though-- and I still-- I think Final Cut's going to be the massive
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   gorilla.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.000]   It is going to be what everyone's using.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   And the one thing I will say is that editors who got away with just knowing how to edit
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.440]   or just knowing how to do some cute graphics for-- especially, like, look at your cable
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.520]   TV ads.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.120]   If those don't transform over the next two years, whoever's doing them isn't paying attention,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.880]   because doing those-- you will be able to do those at budget.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.720]   You'll have thousands of people that know how to use Final Cut in motion.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.880]   And you can make all of those graphics, all of those pieces, all of those edits, much
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.960]   better in Final Cut quickly and inexpensively.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:53.120]   But I think that the very high end, that top 2%, 5%, maybe 10% at the most, is going to
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.160]   go, we need something with-- either they'll stick with Final Cut if they're already using
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.760]   it, or they'll move to Premiere and have it.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.000]   Because we're at Mac break weekly, I should say, Premiere's got a really bad name on the
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.200]   Mac, because for a long time, Premiere was a disaster.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.960]   We had one point where we tried to benchmark Premiere 5, I think.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.720]   And we couldn't finish the test.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.160]   It would just never finish.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.840]   It was so slow and awful.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.440]   And the new Premiere Pro is-- I mean, it is a completely different product.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.240]   So Adobe's a real player, even on the Mac, when it comes to video.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   Now, which it wasn't.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   Absolutely.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   Just to-- we'll continue in a second.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.040]   Just to flatten this question of license, exactly as you said, Jason, I'm looking at
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.440]   the license agreement for Mac App Store product usage.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.560]   You may download and use an application for personal non-commercial use on any Apple
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.480]   branded products that on any OS 10 computer that you own or control.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.720]   So it doesn't seem to have a limit on apps.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.800]   For commercial-- in other words, somewhere like Twit, we have to buy a copy for each
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   individual user.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   Which makes sense.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   Which makes sense.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.160]   Or a single individual on--
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.640]   If you're a commercial enterprise or educational institution, you may download a Mac App Store
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.680]   product for use by either a single individual on each of the Mac computers used by that
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.120]   individual that you own or control, or multiple individuals on a single shared Mac.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.880]   So I could put it on one Mac and have all my editors use that Mac.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.640]   Or I could have copies on all my Macs, but the same guy has to use it every time.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.320]   So if I have four editors, four Macs, I need four licenses is essentially what it is.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   By the way, these are--
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   That's 300 bucks a pop.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:27.160]   It's not a big-- it's cheaper to buy four copies of Final Cut Studio 10 than one copy.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   Right.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.200]   If I have four editors, I'll buy it.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   It's easy.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   It's a no-brainer.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   Now, here's the question we asked when it first came out.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.880]   We weren't sure what components will be included that are in Final Cut 7.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.720]   Now we know that they've now taken compressor out and they've taken motion out, but they
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.320]   don't have any other additional biases.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   And I don't expect to see them.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.240]   So the color, all that stuff, that's still in there.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.000]   Well, still in there is a big word.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.400]   So they've basically-- you know, soundtrack looks like it's gone.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.680]   It was never as stable as people would like it.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   And I found it to be a little clunky.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   The color has been to some degree merged in, but the level of control that you have is
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.480]   pretty-- it's pretty crude.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   Now the thing we have to remember is that 99.9% of everyone using Final Cut never opened
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   color.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   Like they got excited.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.480]   Well, I got a color correction app, and then they opened it as like--
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.000]   It says there's a color sync managed color pipeline to produce accurate, consistent color
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   across that one.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   In app.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Color management.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.320]   And it's different from shading the video.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.600]   Well, I mean, you can do a lot of the fine shading.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.720]   And one thing I have to say is the scopes are gorgeous.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   You know, the scopes are the new Final Cut.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Good looking scopes.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.880]   No, no, but I mean, it looks gorgeous, and you can actually see what's going on.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.200]   And those do make a difference.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.560]   And then there are some primary controls and some--
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.200]   It says there's a single click balance color feature.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.320]   Now, again, there's going to match color feature to match the looks of two clips.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.960]   Now that's nice for us because we are using different cameras.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.000]   So we would, in theory, have a one click match.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Yes.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.280]   And there are many things in Final Cut that are in the new Final Cut that are going to
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.320]   massively speed up people's operations.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.600]   So the way it handles audio correction, the way it handles color correction.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.120]   Is soundtrack in here or no?
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.360]   No, there's a couple tools.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.160]   Now, all the logic plugins are in there.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160]   So all of the logic plugins--
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.160]   Oh!
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.160]   They just kind of put all the logic plugins in.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.840]   But what you don't see is you don't see a full waveform.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   You don't really--
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.840]   So you might still buy logic if you wanted to.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.480]   If you really wanted to go hardcore.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.280]   And you're really going to want a dedicated audio editor.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.600]   You're going to want to use something like Pro Tools.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.920]   Now, I think that the automatic duck is now--
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.640]   they announced today that they're doing a exporter that'll export out of the new Final
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.200]   Cut into Pro Tools.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   So if you want to--
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.960]   You can still use Pro Tools.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   You're someone who really wants to do that.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.520]   Now, again, I think for the kind of people that I think are going to be jumping into this,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   I think that--
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   There's not manual ducks.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   It's automatic ducking?
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   No, no, no.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   Very funny.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.520]   You said jump one again.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.000]   No, I'm not making a joke.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   This is automatic duck manual.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.640]   It's a company that does import, export, in and out of--
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.480]   I thought you were talking about audio ducking.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.680]   Automatic duck is a--
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.640]   Are you as confused as I am right now?
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.640]   It's a company.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.920]   And they export data.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.520]   You can export stuff out of Final Cut into Avid, After Effects, Premiere.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.080]   And they--
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:09.400]   That's separate.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   That's something else.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:17.480]   And so anyway, but I think that, again, for a lot of the stuff, when you're looking
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.320]   at, for instance, something online, online videos, like what we do, what you might see
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.760]   on the daily or wired or the project on the iPad.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   Much easier, much quicker.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.720]   Being able to slap this stuff together on a day-to-day basis, Final Cut is going to
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   be the thing.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.520]   For news organizations, cutting stuff in the field, Final Cut is going to be the thing
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.200]   that everyone's using because it's fast.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.680]   It'll do all that syncing multi-camera.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:44.240]   I haven't tested this yet, but according to the documentation, you bring in four sets
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.440]   of 5D footage that were all shot by different cameras and it'll automatically do what
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.400]   pluralize used to do, which is just sync them all up automatically as they come in.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.120]   It'll clean up your audio, clean up your video.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.960]   For people who are doing fast and furious publishing to the web, publishing for corporate,
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.600]   those types of things, I think this is going to be a godsend.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.960]   That's another thing I really want to know about.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.760]   It seems like there are a lot of features that were distinctly pro apps for Final Cut
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.520]   Pro and Final Cut Express that it looks like it's time for that stuff to start to trickle
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:21.360]   down into iMovie, including the ability to sync video and have multiple video streams
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.960]   in addition to multiple audio streams.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.360]   Do you think that we're going to see anything like that happening with iMovie?
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:33.000]   It's not just that if you're at a kid's birthday party, you know how many camera phones there
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.320]   are out there in addition to the dad or the mom actually shooting with the real camcorder.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.760]   There's grandma with one phone, there's a niece and nephew with another phone.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.720]   The ability to basically say, "Look, email me all these MP4s if you had a utility that
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.040]   could simply sync them all."
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.880]   Now you can actually be doing it like you're doing the live director of the Oscars, "Okay,
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.840]   camera one, give me camera two.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.800]   Now go to the Y-shot before a little trial fast starts to puking, seems to start to go
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.280]   and now cut away to grandma's reaction shot."
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.840]   It seems like a lot of basic features that need to go into iMovie now.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.000]   One of the things, well, yeah, that's multi-clipping and it's not clear that multi-clipping even
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.680]   works in the new final cut.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.960]   I couldn't find it on my first pass, so I don't think that you can actually do what
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.640]   you used to be able to do with final cut, which is a multi-clip where you put in eight
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.720]   of them and you're just hitting the screens and doing the edit.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.160]   I think that stuff was taken out at least for now.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.680]   It definitely, it definitely Apple will add whatever they can do to iMovie that isn't
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.560]   complicated because the idea is to make it keep it straightforward.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.240]   But that's, and I think Andy's point is really interesting, that there's an opportunity,
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.720]   if it's not an iMovie or final cut for somebody else, whether it's an app or a website, to
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.680]   merge a bunch of clips of an event and do something really intelligent with them because
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.400]   that should be easier than it is now.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   There's web apps.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   One singular software that has paralyzed.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   Well, there you go.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   You're going to be able to stand alone, application there.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.600]   Yeah, for regular consumers to dump in, you know, ten different video clips of a birthday
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   party.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   That's a web app, isn't it?
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   Really?
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600]   Shouldn't it be?
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   It could be a web app.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   I mean, that...
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   Just gonna upload all your video.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   Andy, get on it.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   Am I gonna...
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:12.080]   I just don't know if I'm gonna upload like 900 megabytes per user of video just to get
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.520]   that three minute clip.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.200]   But yeah, it seems as though if someone put together a $50 app in the app store that would
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:25.640]   simply say, "Dump in up to five MP4 files," it will sync them automatically and it will
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.360]   spit out simply a quick time file of that same event with all that multi-camera stuff
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.800]   that I could then import into iMovie and use as a scene, that's $50 that would spend.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.000]   And, you know, pluralized does almost all of that just inside of Final Cut and Premiere
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.760]   and Vegas and whatever else.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.920]   So, they already figured it out because it's just looking at the audio waveform and matching
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   that.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.920]   That works incredibly well.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   I want to.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.560]   We're gonna move on in a minute because we could go on and on in Alex.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.120]   I'm sure you're gonna do this on...
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.560]   So we're doing a live stream on Thursday from our studio.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.840]   So we're bringing in Steve Martin from Ripple Training and Mark Spencer.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.160]   And we're flying Steven from Phoenix.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   Mark Spencer's coming up.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.600]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a live stream from the new studio at 6PM Pacific
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   standard and 9PM.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.960]   So people can tune in and it'll be interactive.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.000]   You can watch, you can ask questions all of that.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.840]   And so it's gonna be at...
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.080]   If you follow Pixelcore on Twitter or you follow me, if you follow me, you get my crazy
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   Twittering.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.400]   If you just want business stuff and you just want to know what Pixelcore is doing, then
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.080]   follow Pixelcore on Twitter because that's all business.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:34.960]   With me, I'll post it too, but I also complain about the weather and whatever I'm doing.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.640]   So it depends on what you want.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   But anyway...
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   And what's that?
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   So you're A.B. Lindsay?
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.920]   No, I'm Alex Lindsay, all one word on Twitter.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.280]   And then @Pixelcore is the other one and Carolyn manages that one.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   So she'll...
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   We'll definitely be posting.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.320]   We're gonna be doing a lot of live streaming, but the big live stream...
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.560]   That's Thursday.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.720]   We were already scheduled to do a...
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.760]   On Friday, we're doing the first new...
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.120]   We're doing another round of Macbreak Studio, and we're going to be...
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.800]   It'll be all introducing people to the new Final Cut 10.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.920]   So we'll be recording those to come out in the next month or two.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.720]   But since the guys are already in town, we're gonna go ahead and...
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   Take advantage of that.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.880]   Yeah, so now I gotta figure out how to get it all set up by Thursday.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:21.040]   You know, as soon as the full studio's done, anytime you want to use that studio for these
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.600]   kinds of things, we can work that out.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.280]   In the evenings, it's often empty, and there's no reason not to use it.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.240]   No, that'll be great, because it's the kind of thing about space.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   You can do a round table or whatever.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   Yeah, so we're gonna...
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.440]   And we're gonna get the guys up, they're gonna walk through stuff, and then they're
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.840]   gonna open it to questions.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.760]   And these guys are the...
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.440]   If you go to RippleTraining.com, you can see what they do.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.400]   They actually put out a new training product already for Final Cut 10.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.600]   And they are the trainers who trained our trainers.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.000]   And so they are the... really the top guys in the business, in my opinion, to show you
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   how to do this stuff.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.440]   And we're gonna be doing a four-day training in Final Cut in July, so we're excited.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   Let me...
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.760]   So, but I would like to wrap up with a couple of questions from the chatroom, because there's
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.360]   actually some good questions.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.800]   And I think the fundamental question, let me see if I can find who asked this, is why
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.680]   should I upgrade or should I upgrade, who should upgrade from Final Cut Studio to Final Cut
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   Pro 10?
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   Who's this for?
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.400]   Who's it not for?
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.800]   I think we can kind of...
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.080]   I think if you're covered that, but...
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.520]   I think what you have to do is you have to look at the kind of features that you're using
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.520]   every day and look at whether Final Cut 10 has it.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.800]   If I'm in the middle of production, we're gonna be pretty aggressive about it, because we're
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.360]   covering it.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.560]   But I will say that if I was in the middle of production, I would let it sort itself
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.320]   out for a month or two, to be honest.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.360]   You know, I wouldn't just dive into it.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.880]   And remember, you can't upgrade your...
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.000]   You can't go from 7 to...
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.800]   I would install it and start playing with it.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.080]   I think that if you are doing...
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.000]   Again, if you are doing anything other than really high-end film and TV...
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   It's fine.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.520]   I would definitely look at it very seriously.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.680]   That was Bob Kazi's question.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.280]   I think everybody in there, everybody should play with motion.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.360]   If 50 bucks, you would not to have it.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   I'd like to learn motion.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.360]   This would be fun.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   Yeah, I mean, that's a smart thing to do.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   It's such a cool application.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.680]   And it kind of is a gateway drug for...
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.680]   For 10, right?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:18.000]   Well, and again, it's a plugin development environment for Final Cut.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.200]   So you can do all kinds of crazy setups.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.960]   So for instance, if you're building a pipeline, just...
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.760]   Okay, save that for Thursday.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.000]   I'll save it for Thursday.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.800]   I'm about to give you that.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   I know.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.600]   It's just it's only an hour, two hour, maybe three hour show.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.680]   So we could do more.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.680]   We could do more.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   You will do a lot more on Thursday.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   Thursday at 6.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.200]   And you're in Conduit and DV, Matt, those will continue to work.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.240]   So I don't know what we're going to do with DV, Matt, because the new plugin, the new
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.600]   key here in Final Cut is so good that we have to look at it.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   Well, you may not need it.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   We don't know if it's needed.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   It's our bread and butter.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.520]   So we're kind of like, "Wow."
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520]   We're going to have to...
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   Wow.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   So we have to...
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   They did a great job on the plugin.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.600]   So we're looking at it today, this morning, and figuring out what we're going to do.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.800]   I think Conduit, we're still going to do it because it solves a problem.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   Nothing there solves.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.760]   But yeah, DV, Matt, we're not sure what's going to happen.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   We may keep it...
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   Obviously it'll be still available for older Final Cut, but I'm not sure what we're going
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   to do with the new one.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.200]   Jason, what are your thoughts before we take a break and come back with other...
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.760]   Other news on this hot new Final Cut Pro stand?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.320]   I think that the people who are going to be most excited about it, to Echo Alex because
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.920]   he's the man, he knows about this, are a lot of the people like, "There's a guy Rob Griffiths
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.320]   who used to work for us."
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   Oh, yeah, I know, Rob.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.960]   He was so mad when iMovie got upgraded and because he was trying to do more complicated
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.240]   stuff and he switched to Final Cut Express, but he was frustrated with the way it behaved
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.880]   because it was a light version of Final Cut Pro.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.560]   I look at Final Cut Pro X and think this is probably the product for Rob because it does
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.920]   all of these Pro things that iMovie just can't do anymore but is friendlier for somebody
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.160]   like him who's not a professional editor than Final Cut or even Final Cut Express was.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.440]   So it's that kind of person I think is going to really embrace this.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.160]   And a whole new generation of editor and director.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   And students.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160]   It's going to be huge.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   It really is going to be...
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.440]   I think it's definitely the move that Apple had to make.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.640]   I mean, Andy, final thoughts on Final Cut Pro X before we move on?
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   Pretty much echoing what the people have said.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.760]   I think most of the people who are cutting video, or people who are...
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   Excuse me.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.920]   A great many of the people who are cutting video these days are people who weren't trained
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.960]   for it, didn't grow up thinking they're going to be doing that but wound up being the guy
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.920]   in the office who can cut video together.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.080]   And this is from what I've seen of it so far.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.600]   I haven't downloaded myself but I've seen already people give us walkthroughs of it.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.240]   It already seems like it's more instinctive for people who don't know the language of
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   film editing.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.040]   They just kind of...
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.960]   They can watch enough Scrids AZ movies to figure out, "Okay, I guess I want to cut from
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   here to here.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.240]   I want to make sure we get a shot of this."
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   That's me.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   I'm excited about it.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.520]   And for people like us who want to get good at video or want to get better at video, this
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   is a real opportunity.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.040]   I think this is very exciting.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.080]   And again, I just want to reiterate because I know there's so much more to talk about.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.320]   We haven't really talked about compression and motion that much.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.480]   You're going to do this all on Thursday.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   You're going to go in...
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Three hour...
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Deep, deep, deep.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   Two to three hour geek fest.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   Which I would have loved to do but we just...
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   Right on, we can't do.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.320]   We have other stuff to talk about here.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.040]   Thursday, find out about it by following @Pixelsacore on Twitter.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.520]   They'll give you time and location and all that.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.520]   Yup.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.520]   Pixelcore.com.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   We'll also have a link, I'm sure, to do it.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   Absolutely on the front page.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   Wow.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   It's exciting.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.240]   I mean, I was really surprised when I got up and I saw that.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.720]   I said, "Wow.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   Maybe because I wasn't..."
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.040]   You know, like Lion, I'm waiting.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.400]   There's a clock ticking in the back of my head.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   I know Lion's going to come.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   It's going to be in July.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   It's going to be...
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   But that's...
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   I didn't have a clock ticking in the back of my head.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   Yeah, we've been...
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   Yeah, it's like every week.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   Every Tuesday, like when is it?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   Is it going to come out?
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   You have.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   Okay.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   Is it Tuesdays or Tuesdays when they release the new stuff?
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   Tuesdays are good.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.840]   In the publishing world, Tuesday is generally a good day to send out releases because Monday
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   no one wants to...
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   Everyone wants Monday to prep.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   Right.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.840]   And Tuesday, then you have as much of the week to run as possible.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   That's good to remember.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.240]   Everything in the publishing world, we only work on Tuesday.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.080]   That's funny because that's when we do this show.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.400]   We don't really call it work exactly.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.960]   I will say one last thing though.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.240]   Isn't this emblematic of Apple that they're willing to simply say, "We know the people
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.320]   are going to be upset that we're making a huge change to something, that we're sort
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.040]   of forcing you to throw away a lot of your old knowledge."
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.360]   But we honestly think this is the right thing to do for the product.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   That's really the...
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   It's their strengths.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.080]   And they can afford to do this because they're hardware manufacturer because they have a
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.720]   lot of other income streams.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   You couldn't...
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   I can't do it.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   Well, Adobe...
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.560]   This would be terrifying for Adobe or Avid, just Jettison, all of your, you know, what
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.400]   people know you as and start over again.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.760]   But think of all the times Apple's done something like this.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.160]   It's gone from PowerPC to Intel.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.000]   It's gone from OS 9 to OS 10.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.160]   I mean, this is exactly as you say, Andy.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.920]   This is kind of prototypical Apple.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   And that's...
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   I guess the strength...
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.240]   It could be conceived as a weakness by some.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.440]   I think so.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   I think it keeps the movement fast.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   And it's hard to keep...
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.600]   It means really relevant five years from now instead of just stuck with, well, we've got
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.680]   90% of the industry, but 90% of the user base, but we're really...
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.560]   We've lost our ability to influence the board direction.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.720]   And the thing is, is no matter how smart you are, when you set up a code structure, when
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.880]   you set up a library and you set up how you're going to put together an application, it's
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.640]   based on what you know today.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.480]   And 10 years later, you've learned a lot of things and the structures have changed and
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.720]   you want to take full advantage of those.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.520]   And I think that that's hard when you're just slowly trying to move that code, you know,
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.360]   when you're trying to be backwards compatible.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.160]   All right.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   It's here.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.520]   Go download it, but not while you're watching if you're watching live, because it'll screw
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   up your bandwidth.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   And not while you're driving.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.160]   Not while you do not drive.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.560]   Do not do not download while driving.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.880]   We've got more rumors to talk about, including a black air.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:49.080]   And I want to see if Jason knows anything about Lion and release times, but before we do that,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.040]   we were talking about the new studio.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   We have got...
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.440]   We are getting right close to 1000 brick orders.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.840]   We don't know if we're going to go to 2000.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.800]   I think we will, but we at some point have to cut this off because we've got to lay our
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.280]   bricks.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.120]   How many times have I said that before?
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.480]   And so if you have yet not ordered a brick, you've seen the bricks.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.840]   These are the little 8 by 4s here.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.520]   And then we have the larger 8 by 8s.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.880]   You can even get your company logo on it.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.480]   Go to bricks.twit.tv.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.000]   Time is running out.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.320]   I'll give you like 48 hours when we get right down to it.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.760]   But at some point, we've got to put these bricks in.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.160]   We can't be doing it when we're...
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.000]   And I think we're going to be in the studio in the next month.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.680]   So hurry, hurry.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   If you want to get your brick laid, now's the time.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.880]   Let me throw down the gauntlet too.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.240]   If when I visit the cottage when it's all finished, if I am not forced to spend at least
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.480]   20 minutes reading wise-ass comments.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.480]   They're great.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   But left on bricks.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.960]   I'm going to be very...
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.160]   I appreciate the immemorium, Nana.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   You are the lad of my life.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.160]   I appreciate that.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.480]   But I really want to see comments that are like, "Oh, well, that's unkind.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.080]   Not to me or to anybody at Twit."
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   But I'd like to really this be 100 years from now when our next generations are now turning
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.800]   this into something else, they realize that, "Wow, somebody really hated..."
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.360]   I don't know what Skype is, but somebody really hated it.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.360]   Exactly.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   And I have to...
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.360]   Andy, you're going to be gratified.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   It is...
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   You're going to...
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   When you come to the wall, you're going to want to look...
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   You're going to be a skyscart.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.040]   There's some really good stuff in there.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.120]   There's a lot of gems.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.360]   You're going to end up...
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.200]   If you come to the brick house, come an hour early so you have time to peruse the brick
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.120]   garden because it's right there.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.760]   It'll be right behind the reception desk and then curving around and it's already some
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   hysterical.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   I've reviewed them all and there's some very...
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.400]   I won't spoil, but there's some really good stuff in there.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.040]   I also want to mention our great sponsor Citrix.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.760]   As always, they make it possible to do these shows with their advertising support and mention
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.440]   go to meeting a great product for people who are in business and have business meetings,
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.840]   whether you're in sales and training.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.200]   If you collaborate with people who are not next door, this is such a great solution.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.160]   We use it almost every day, partly because you get a built-in conference bridge.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.600]   So it's part of the deal.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.400]   So with our GoToMeeting account, anytime we want to have even just a teleconference,
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.240]   we'll click that button, automatically sends out the invites.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.000]   It's all set up and the beauty of it is you can be on the teleconference and still show
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.840]   screens, engage people.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.120]   You can do a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.920]   It's Mac or PC.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.840]   It's easy for your customers or prospects even to install.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   They don't mind.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.720]   They get the invitation that goes right into their calendar, which is really nice.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.600]   Then they know that meeting's coming up.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.760]   They click the link that's in their calendar, automatically populated by GoToMeeting and
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.120]   the GoToMeeting software installs.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   It's refreshed every time, so it's always up to date.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.720]   It's always secure.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   And there you are.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.680]   30 seconds later, you're seeing my screen so I can present to you.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.680]   It is absolutely a must-have for business and I want you to get it now.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.400]   The best way to do this is try it free for 30 days.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:58.800]   If you visit GoToMeeting.com, and then use the offer code MacBreak, I should really change
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.320]   our lower third because it says slash MacBreak.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:06.480]   The way we want you to do it now is just visit GoToMeeting.com and then use the offer code
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.720]   MacBreak when it asks you.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.360]   That way we get credit, we appreciate you doing that instead of those other shows that
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   Leo hosts.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   I hate those other shows.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.120]   You want to support MacBreak weekly.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.800]   GoToMeeting.com, click the try it free button and use MacBreak.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   We thank you.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.080]   Citrix for your support and you are viewers and listeners.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.600]   We haven't yet received a blue brick of death, but there is one brick.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.400]   There's, well, I don't want to support, okay, there's some funny bricks.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.120]   There's a 404, brick not found.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.960]   I like that.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.800]   There's one push here to open wall.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   I like that.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.240]   We're going to put a camera on that brick, see how many people will push it.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.040]   It's going to get worn out.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.640]   It's going to be worn out.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   I just love it.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   I just love it.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:54.240]   I've always thought that if you really want the greatest tattoo in the world, you should
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.160]   actually get a QR code.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.120]   That way people can just check the QR code and they can keep changing your tattoo in
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.400]   case you ever be embarrassed about it.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.200]   If you're concerned about this, you can get great value for money by just paying for the
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.240]   top wack brick where you get the actual artwork to supply.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   We do.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   If you get the AIA, you could put a QR code on it.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.360]   And then you could basically keep updating this brick with whatever thing you want to
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   say.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.520]   Things you think you can only get away with for one day before someone forces you to put
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   to take it down.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   You could do that.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.480]   Actually, I had a logo brick right behind me, but I got another one.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   This is the commemorative one.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.440]   If you order the commemorative one, you get a full-size brick.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.440]   See, you could put a logo.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   I think there's enough resolution.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   I don't know how to check.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.120]   Just have a brick with a QR code.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.840]   It could have a joke.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.880]   There's, I mean, you could have thought.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   And you're right, Andy.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   You change it every week.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   It's by reference, right?
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   So you could change it.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.080]   So you just put it to a URL.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.600]   Just keep changing what's at that URL for the rest of your life or for the rest of the
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   building.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   That's awesome.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   You should pay attention to this.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   Yes, you do.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   No off-brick.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.520]   That brick has shifted the gravity in this room, I think.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   It's so heavy.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.080]   So this is not the one we...
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   I'll show you the ones that we're going to...
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.680]   Oh, he's off on the bricks now.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.280]   Hit the bricks, Leo.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   Hit the bricks.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   One more.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   See, this is a thin one.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   That's the one that we put on the wall.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   But then if you order, you can...
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.040]   It's heavy.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.440]   You can order a murder somebody with this.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.040]   They put felt on it so you could use it to brain people and not leave marks.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.640]   Moving right along.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   It's rumor time.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   We should have a...
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   You know what?
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   I'm going to ask somebody to make us a little rumor jingle.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   Yes.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   It's time for rumors, rumors for Mac, Break, Weekly, and the man...
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   Right, but say responsible.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.520]   Almost have a valuable rumor.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   Are they true?
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.240]   Oh, we just did it.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   We just wrote it for you.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   Now just put it to music.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.240]   And we're safe.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.120]   And since Jason Stiles here, he's certainly the guy to ask.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   Noted rumor monkerer.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   Ruder me.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.400]   What is Mac world's policy about those?
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.920]   We try not to cover them because so many of them were not true.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   And yet?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   Some of them are true.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.160]   It's hard not to, isn't it?
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   Right.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.000]   At some point you have to because they're out there in the water and you have to.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.520]   But we try not to report on every single rumor that's flow.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.800]   Well, you certainly don't want to do it in the paper magazine because certainly you
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   could be embarrassed.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.080]   Right, but on the web, it's one of those things that we have to walk along because some of
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.840]   them have the ring of truth about them.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   Right.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.640]   You have to report them as a rumor unless you've got confirmation from some source.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   It's tricky because people want to know.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.680]   So, rumor one, we're going to see new Macs.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.280]   New Mac minis are due.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.520]   We haven't had a mini update for a while.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.520]   Mac book fairs.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   And air.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   Next month?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.520]   Do you think that's true?
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.520]   Yeah, it makes sense to me.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.520]   There was a rumor they were coming out this month and then the latest update.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   They should come with Lion.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:50.440]   And Lion is so oriented toward small screens and trackpads and multi-touch devices that
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.520]   it doesn't really make sense for you not to ship laptops with Lion if you've got new
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.520]   laptops coming.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.720]   And I know people are really excited about the prospect of the new Mac book fairs and
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.080]   the Mac minis being on the Sandy Bridge set of chips which are much more powerful than
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   the current and local.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.360]   Every single, the hallmark of what Apple needs to do is, and what they are doing is to go
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.040]   through the entire line to give it the Thunderbolt and Sandy Bridge.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.360]   So anything you see in the product line that does not have that right now is pretty much
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.360]   imminent after Lion.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.720]   It's coming, yeah.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:27.680]   And I got to say, before I told you about how tempted I was to get an 11-inch air just
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.360]   to travel with and how really pitifully I cried when I had to send it back to Apple
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.080]   after my loan period was due.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.920]   Now you're happy, aren't you?
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:41.840]   Well, not only that, but you take the 11, I'm talking about the $1,000 the cheapest one,
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.240]   64 gigs of storage, 11-inch screen.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   Perfect machine.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.080]   You start off with that.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.240]   You add Thunderbolts, so now you don't have to worry about multiple displays.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.440]   You don't have to worry about being able to attach a high-speed drive to it.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   Okay.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.280]   You're also now talking about Lion where it's no longer going to be terribly important
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.800]   to have lots of storage.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   Because I'm not.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.880]   Assuming that this is just your out of the office for a day or for a week sort of a
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:11.640]   machine, I can just so I can, that's perfectly enough storage for simply, for I can simply
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.960]   grab it, grind to the airport and realize that the 11 or 20 different documents and
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.720]   projects I've got going on have automatically been synced to it automatically.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.400]   And I don't have to worry about version control on the way back.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.160]   It suddenly becomes really, really extra tempting now.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.400]   And you can always buy a brick if you want something that weighs more for your lats.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   Right.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.680]   If you want to feel like you've got an old-school laptop in your bag, add a brick.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.960]   Alio, is that why you're looking so ripped these days?
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.880]   Have you been exercising with those as well?
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.480]   I've been lifting bricks.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.040]   But I, you know, to Andy's point, as somebody who's used the MacBook Air since it came
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:53.600]   out, it was a big step when the day after the second USB port and they did the 11-inch
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.120]   model, if they can add Thunderbolts plus those sandy bridge chips, it really opens things
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   up.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.040]   And the big problems with the Air was that it was so constrained in terms of what it could
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.000]   do talking to the outside world because it had one USB 2 port.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.200]   So you bring in Thunderbolts and teach.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.360]   I think really all you need is power in Thunderbolts.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   I mean, you know, I think that-
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.720]   Well, you'll have USB, right?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   Right.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.680]   But the Thunderbolts is going to be key if you want fast storage or I mean, it's going
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   to be big.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.000]   And I do think Thunderbolts is going to go everywhere.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   It's going to replace the mini-display port because it doubles as the mini-display port.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.880]   And, you know, so I think it will be on the mini, too.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   Everywhere.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   JP Morgan estimated that Apple's air business is actually the biggest part of their business.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.480]   He says that Apple is a three- that the air alone is a $3 billion business.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:47.120]   He says air sales rose 2.9% in the first quarter outpacing desktops, which I think
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   is kind of interesting.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.160]   Well, but I think part of that is that all of us, as soon as that we saw Thunderbolt,
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.520]   all of a lot of us who buy desktops knew that eventually we're going to get Thunderbolt
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.200]   and no one's buying them.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.280]   Like everyone's, I mean, I don't know.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.080]   No one's buying air's?
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   No one's buying desktops?
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.080]   No one's buying desktops.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   No one's buying desktops.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.080]   I know.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.080]   I bought a desktop, but I'm an idiot.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.080]   I don't.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   What do I know?
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   I'm just like, all of us are on on.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   Like we're dying to buy more more.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   I wish I hadn't bought an air.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.120]   I wish I'd listened to you, Andy, because I'm going to want this new one.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.320]   But we're all waiting for Thunderbolt because the storage opportunities there just.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.920]   And I think we are going to see, I think Thunderbolt's also going to bring us so much
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.320]   smaller, much thinner.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.440]   So maybe that's why JP Morgan said this, but that Mac Pro.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:30.320]   There were 432,000 MacBook Air sold in the quarter.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.400]   They say that number is going to go to 700,000 quarterly units.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   I mean, that's huge.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.640]   Well, let's not forget.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.360]   I think it's very clear that the MacBook Air is becoming the mainstream laptop for Apple.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.160]   I think that it will be in the next couple of years.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.080]   It will be what we're looking at is Apple's vision of what they want all laptops to be,
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.560]   which is thin and light and with solid state storage.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.400]   It's inevitable that that's where we're going to go.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.240]   And we're getting its success.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.240]   Remember that first error?
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.880]   I used it, but nobody else did.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.080]   But when the 999 11 inch and the and the 13 inch model came out last year, it became
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   a hit.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.120]   It became a hit and I think that it's only going to increase.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.400]   I was able to hold off on the original air.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   Got one for my daughter.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   It was slow.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   It was over heated.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:16.080]   That SSD slightly faster processor and just better design overall really made the difference.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.580]   Intel has added.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:24.940]   This is from today's Apple Insider, three new high efficiency Sandy Bridge CPUs to the product
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.380]   catalog.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:31.220]   Apple Insider says this is likely the chips Apple will use in the next MacBook Air, their
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:38.020]   ULV parts, 17 watt parts, which is very ultra low, ultra low voltage is what that is.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:42.060]   And what's interesting is there's two i7s as well as an i5.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   Imagine a 1.8 gigahertz i7 peaking to 2.9 gigahertz in that sucker.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.060]   Wow.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.900]   And you wonder like, you know, I still do some heavy lifting on the 17 inch.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.260]   I would love to see a 17 inch air like get rid of all those parts and all this other
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.260]   stuff.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.260]   Like I would just get rid of that.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.260]   It's not an air dude.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.580]   No, it's a thin 17 inch.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:05.980]   Yeah, but with all SSD, all SSD, no, no CD ROM, you know, take out some of the give
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.540]   me just a wonderful kind of call it the Alex.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.540]   It would basically.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.300]   I'm holding you to that.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.300]   I'm holding you to that.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   I want.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.980]   The 17 is where they put every port that they've gotten rid of on every other device.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:22.980]   But as someone who's looking at the next 17 inch, all I all I need from them is a is
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.980]   a thunderbolt connection.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.060]   You know, like to me, if you give me power and a thunderbolt connection, I can figure
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.780]   out everything else on the other end of that.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.660]   You know, I don't need them to do anything more than that at this point.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.940]   I could have a little breakout box that does that has two thunderbolt connections and
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.300]   then all of my connections.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.020]   See, all of our talk about thunderbolt, we should make it clear that thunderbolt is
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.220]   something I actually wrote a piece about this last month on mackerel.com.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.220]   It doesn't exist yet.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   I asked everybody.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   Anybody got a thunderbolt cable?
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.260]   Anybody got a thunderbolt hard drive?
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.820]   Well, they're coming out this summer.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.100]   You know, there's a new feature where you can do thunderbolt video in so you can take
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.940]   a MacBook Pro with thunderbolt and plug it into an iMac with thunderbolt and use it
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.180]   as an external monitor.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.660]   But you need a thunderbolt cable to do that and nobody has a thunderbolt cable right
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.660]   now.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.740]   So this is all theoretical until later this summer.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.460]   It's definitely a cutting edge technology.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.180]   But in the long term, it's going to be huge.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.180]   It's just in the short term, we're still waiting.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.180]   I've seen some dead eye units.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.820]   Oh, much rather than in a thunderbolt is an illuminated keyboard on the air.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.260]   I didn't think I'd miss that as much as I did.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.260]   I really miss that.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.660]   Do you think they'll do that?
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.260]   If they can fit it in, sure.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.620]   I mean, I think it's just a question of power drain.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.420]   I think you have to stick it in the space and have the little things lighting underneath.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.980]   I think I just have to say, I just think a thunderbolt works extremely well in my head.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.580]   Oh, it's been, it has never been defeated right now.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.380]   It is a love technology.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.180]   But doesn't mean it doesn't mean it does.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:50.420]   It was a great regret that I have not reviewed the new MacBook or the new iMac yet because
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:56.020]   I've decided that I really can't review these things until I see something working on thunderbolt.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:01.700]   The first, because the first time that I get my hands on a cable, a shipping working cable,
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.220]   plug it into two different thunderbolt devices and one of them explodes, I'm going to be very,
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.980]   very happy that I held off on my review.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:12.700]   What about the three, the rumor that we three you Mac, Mac pros.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.700]   Wow.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.700]   I think it makes sense.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.580]   I mean, the Mac Pro is going to a different place, right?
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.940]   They have a place where computers go to die.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:20.940]   It's a better place.
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.540]   You're taking it to a farm where it could be had a truck.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   Why?
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.260]   I definitely, I would love to get rid of that big keep in whatever and move to a rack mountable.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.660]   I mean, to me, rack a rack mountable Mac Pro would be.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.300]   But how many, how many users have rack?
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.780]   This is sort of what Apple did with Final Cut that they're doing with Mac Pro where they're
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.300]   saying, look, most people, except the super high end, you don't want this.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.300]   You want an iMac.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.300]   Core i7 iMac with a Thunderbolt.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   That's 27 inches.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   Amazing.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.700]   It'll, it does almost anything anyone wants.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:51.540]   And if you really need more than that, you know, there's the Mac Pro, what, what does
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.940]   that product turn into then?
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.380]   Maybe what it's currently like isn't, you know, doesn't make sense anymore because it used
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:01.340]   to be power users bought Power Macs or Mac Pros and put them on their desktop or under
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.340]   their desk.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:06.300]   And you know, most of us speaking for myself, I never used to buy iMacs and I bought an
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.220]   iMac because it's powerful enough.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.100]   So what, how does it transform people like you?
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.840]   And the thing for me is that, and again, once we see Thunderbolt working, the big thing
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.620]   for me is expandability, expandability, which I theoretically can be handled with Thunderbolt.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:21.820]   Externally as opposed to internal.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.820]   Well, it's a full PCI.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.820]   Exactly.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.940]   So the black magic cards, for instance, we buy Mac Pros because we need to put those black
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.140]   magic capture cards in our world.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.740]   They're coming out with Thunderbolt connections to, you know, to black magic and I mean theoretically
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   you're going to.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.500]   Didn't we just buy, we just got a new Mac Pro.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   So that means that there'd be due to be phased out.
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.500]   Exactly.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.580]   Mm hmm.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.380]   Just bought one.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.180]   There is something new that has come out today.
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:54.940]   Brand new three terabyte, what do they call those time capsules and also a brand new airport
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.140]   is it the extreme or the express extremes?
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.620]   What is new Jason in the extremes?
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:05.700]   Have they confirmed that I thought that they confirmed that the that there was a rumor that
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.700]   they were going to be updated.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.900]   And I think all we know is that they've taken the time capsule up to three terabytes now.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.900]   Oh, we don't know about the extreme.
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.820]   I don't think they announced an extreme update or if they did, it's one of those stealth updates
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.220]   that happen in place and that they'll turn.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:22.140]   Oh, you know why it's quote confirmed because the FC there was an SEC filing.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.740]   Yeah, but it looks like the big news on that is just that they added some larger time capsule
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:32.100]   skews and time capsules, basically the airport extreme based station, a Wi-Fi router that's
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.740]   got a hard giant hard drive in it.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.660]   So you can run time machine and backup wirelessly and just plug it in.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.620]   It's like a backup appliance firm.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.620]   Do you recommend those?
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.620]   Do you like those?
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.660]   You paying a lot of money for a hard drive.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.940]   I mean, I think you I think you're 99 for three terabytes.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:52.100]   If you're never ever wired at home, maybe it's a maybe it's a good deal.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.060]   But otherwise, you know, you could just buy a terabyte drive and plug it in every now
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.780]   and then to do your backup.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.980]   You know, I've got a server in the closet in my house.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.260]   I bet you all of us use that.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.260]   I used that as something.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.780]   Yeah, I've got a Mac mini that lives in my closet and I back up to that.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:11.620]   Most people I understand probably don't have Mac mini in their closet.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.020]   I was like, I have Mac mini.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.780]   They have it in their coffee table and stuff.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.460]   Actually, you know, we're going to I think we're placing in the new studio stream of
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.340]   source, which is our streaming box.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.660]   That has six Mac minis in it.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.100]   And then there's another one over there.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   These are older Mac minis.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.940]   I don't have no idea what I mean, I mean, Intel, but I don't know.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.940]   Well, if you don't know what you want to do with them, what would you suggest?
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:29.940]   I will take them off.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.100]   No, no, no, no, that means there's something I could do with them.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.100]   Little servers.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.100]   I mean, they're great for little media servers.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.100]   Yeah, just just grab.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.180]   No, but moving media around where you don't need a lot of processor speed.
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.780]   I mean, I'm using an older one right now.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.780]   And that's like, that's basically.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.340]   But you attach an external big external drive to it.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.460]   Yeah, I've got I've got like three Drobo's connected to.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.540]   So I have a terabyte drive attached to mine.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:52.700]   I take the DVDs that I've got that are older than my kids want to watch on the iPad.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.740]   I use it as my handbrake machine.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.740]   It's my iTunes server.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.740]   It's running iTunes.
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.540]   I've got some I've got some Logitech squeeze, squeeze box music players.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.100]   It runs the squeeze box server.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.180]   It's it's running back up.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.180]   So it'll back I can back up time machine to it.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.700]   And my printers attached to it via USB printer sharing.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.780]   So it is the print server to point out that if you have an old time capsule, it's easy
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.980]   enough to open it up and put a bigger drive in there too.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:15.980]   I believe so.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:21.060]   So you're not that is that is a really interesting use model though, because it you don't have
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:26.420]   to be that much of a power user to have that desire to have one machine that is on and
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.620]   on the network 24/7, right?
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.460]   Because you wouldn't do it just for VNC.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.580]   You wouldn't do it just to some VPN.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.540]   You wouldn't do it just for squeeze box.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.780]   But when you go through your house and you realize that, wow, I've got like 11 things
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:42.700]   that work so much better if I had a dedicated machine that was kind of walled off a little
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.100]   bit from all the other machines in the house that I think that is not going to burn up
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.980]   as much power as a toaster oven if I keep it running.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.740]   So that's one of the things I keep revisiting the idea.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.980]   If you ever decide to get rid of any of those old Mac minis, I would probably I like Alex
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.220]   would probably take one off your hands.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.260]   Because I keep waiting for Apple to drop the price down to $249.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.900]   At which point it makes a complete sense for me to have a dedicated headless machine.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:11.700]   And we're looking at them for like for instance in an office environment, we're looking at
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.700]   keeping our schedules and stuff like that, taking the old Mac minis and just having them
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.460]   use quartz composer and just looking at an RSS feed of what the schedules are and just
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.980]   you know putting them up on cheap little monitors and it's just great way to just kind of there's
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.900]   lots of little things you can do with these with these older Mac minis.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.900]   They're just great machines.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.460]   Good because I got a lot of them.
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:32.100]   And if you're looking for if you're looking in the market for a home server, the newest
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.460]   generation of Mac minis and especially these new ones when they come out if they've got
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.260]   the sandy bridge stuff and thunderbolt.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.060]   Apple last year when they revised them they're super low power.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.500]   I mean they were fairly low power before they're real low power now.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.980]   So it will use even less of that toaster ovens worth of power that Andy talked about than
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:49.980]   before.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.820]   So they're pretty they're pretty green as things go.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.300]   You know they're trying.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.300]   I have to work on that.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.860]   My whole house is always warm.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.620]   I suddenly realized it was because I got all these servers and everything else running
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.260]   in this little house and I'm like and now and now that it's summer.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.380]   You saw these guys who are running Bitcoin generators.
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.860]   Because if you're doing Bitcoin which is this internet currency, you can run machines
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.100]   against it to try to generate bitcoins.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:16.580]   It's kind of a random process.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.860]   But for a while not anymore the markets crashed for bitcoins.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.300]   But for a while the market was quite inflated.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.940]   And there were guys who were running because if you have an ATI 5870 or really high end
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:32.220]   GPU, you can run the GPU to generate bitcoins and have a better shot at making some money
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.220]   on it.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.820]   They were running so many of these that they got busted for being a grow house.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.620]   The cops said the only people who could possibly be using that much power must be grown marijuana.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:46.820]   I read a piece by somebody who did the math on his cooling costs, his air conditioning
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.460]   costs and discovered he was spending way more to cool off all those computers than he was.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.060]   So we're going to make a Bitcoin and then the market crashed.
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.540]   Which made it even less likely.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.540]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:57.540]   Turns out you don't get something for nothing.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.780]   Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.780]   We're going to take a break.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   Come back with more.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:06.540]   It's great to have Jason Snell in studio with us on this nice hot first day of summer.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.460]   It feels like a happy summer solstice to you the longest day of the year.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.700]   And Jason is dressed for it.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.620]   Jason is editor in chief of math world magazine.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.380]   Jason J Snell on Twitter.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.620]   Alex Lindsey is also with us from the Pixel Core.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.340]   Thursday is the big day for their full Final Cut Pro 10 roundup.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.340]   We're very excited.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.900]   Yeah, I will be watching that.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.900]   Maybe I'll even hang out.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.260]   And if you're in the UK, I think that the super group, they're actually having a super
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.260]   group meeting in the UK.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.260]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.620]   That's going to happen in the evening there.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.340]   So if you're there, check out supermeat.com.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.340]   They're doing their own event.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.900]   And I think they're going to be showing it.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.460]   And then we'll be doing our live stream at 6 p.m.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.460]   Cool.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.460]   Very exciting.
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.700]   And of course, Andy Inako is also here.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:49.580]   His lulsec handle is winged victory, just in case you're trying to figure out what that
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   is behind him.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.580]   We will--
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.580]   Right upon the walkers.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.580]   I know.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.580]   I know.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.460]   And just your French, if you're heard of him.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.940]   Let's tell you a little bit about squarespace.com.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:05.380]   Before we continue on, I want to talk about the powder coat airbook, MacBook Air.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.380]   That's the one I want.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.140]   The one that absorbs finger grease so well.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:12.420]   But before we talk about that, let's talk a little bit about the greatest place, the
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:16.980]   secret behind exceptional websites, squarespace.com.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.420]   Alex is a squarespace user.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   I'm a squarespace user.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.260]   Inside.twit.tv, our company blog is on squarespace.
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.820]   And we do it in so many different ways.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:24.820]   You use it in pixacore.com.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:25.820]   You're crazy.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.820]   You're crazy.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.820]   You're just the one squarespace.com.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:28.820]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.820]   And they're all very different.
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   They're all have different requirements.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.820]   That's cool about that.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.820]   Everything else.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:33.820]   And it's great.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.300]   You could try it right now if you go to squarespace.com.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.940]   Click the try it free button.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.340]   And you can try it out.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.340]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.660]   All really you need is the name of your site, a password for the site and an email address
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:48.820]   so they can tell you when your two week trial is over and say, "Hey, you want to buy it?"
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.660]   And by the way, if you do decide to buy, let me send you to the pricing section because
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.540]   I've got a little update for you.
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.580]   Normally, 12 bucks a month for the standard account.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.500]   Of course, the longer you subscribe, the less expensive it is.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.620]   But I can get you 30% off the first three months.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.860]   How about that?
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.700]   If you use the offer code MACBreak6 when you buy.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.700]   MACBreak6 as in the sixth month of the year.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.860]   When you look at that subscription, remember that if you were publishing a website with
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.580]   something else, you might not pay that, but you wouldn't.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.580]   You'd still be paying for a server.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:17.580]   This is hosting plus.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.580]   This is hosting plus.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.580]   I think that sometimes people don't understand the deal that this is the best hosting, by
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.780]   the way, really great hosting for websites out there.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   They use a very sophisticated virtual server technology that is always on, always up.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.620]   You just land it.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.820]   Yeah, you can't run out of bandwidth.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.980]   They've got blog importing.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:38.460]   Actually, they say blog, but really many websites run on these APIs.
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.660]   The Blogger Type-Ed, WordPress, or Mobile Type API.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:46.660]   If you have that API on your server, you can import and export.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.380]   When they say import, I mean it gets everything.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.380]   It gets images.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.380]   It gets the links.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.540]   All the Permalinks are all working everything.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:57.580]   They've got all sorts of templates, including photo galleries, forums, form building and
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.620]   data collection, and the greatest little widgets for your social integration.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.980]   Like all the Squarespace design tools, these widgets are slider-based.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.220]   It's all point and click.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:12.180]   If you know CSS and JavaScript, you can use it, but you don't have to, to get a great-looking,
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.580]   unique site.
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.300]   Point and click your way to a brand new page.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.060]   If you've got friends who are not yet on the web, tell them about it.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.260]   Squarespace.com, that Facebook page does not count.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.660]   Squares, really, seriously.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.620]   Squarespace.com, click the try and free button for two weeks.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.340]   If you decide to keep that site, make sure you use Mac.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.140]   Break 6 as the offer code to save 30% for the first three months.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   The secret behind exceptional websites Squarespace.com.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.780]   There was a rumor, I know you don't do rumors, Jason, but there was a rumor there.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.820]   I kind of like this rumor that they do a black powder-coated MacBook here.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.820]   Wouldn't that look cool?
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.420]   I have the black MacBook.
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.420]   I thought it was really cool.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.220]   This is as close as I could get.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.300]   Actually, the Incipio Feather case is a great way to do that.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.300]   It looks beautiful.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.300]   I have a red feather case online.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.220]   Notice all the fingerprints, and that's not even a powder.
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.220]   Isn't there a follow-up rumor that said, "Yeah, they tried it," but it was really bad,
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.380]   and there were lots of fingerprint problems, which was the problem with that black MacBook
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.620]   back in the day, too.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:14.380]   The black Dell did the same thing with one of their domos, and it was horrible.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.220]   What happened, they published the rumor, and then I can't remember what site published
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:22.020]   it, but they got an email from an Apple insider who said, "Yeah, actually, we did try that."
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.780]   Not only on the airs, but we tried it on pros and other stuff.
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:29.980]   The problem is that your palm grease on the palm rest is absorbed, and these things look
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   horrible.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:37.780]   But also, you go into the Apple Store, and boy, I'll give you how many black things do you
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.700]   see on display for sale there, made by Apple?
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:41.700]   Right.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:42.700]   It's either white or aluminum.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.700]   I had to cover.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:47.100]   But let's not forget that I have that black MacBook somewhere.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.100]   iPhone.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.380]   That was $100 premium for the black paint.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.500]   They made some money on that, son.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   They did.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   So there's a market for it.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.380]   I think if they could make it work, they would, although it does seem to have not fit
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.300]   their design aesthetic right now.
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:05.060]   You even saw it with the iPad 2, where they've got the nice curved metal back.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.260]   That's what they're going for now.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.260]   What about the rumors?
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.260]   Oh, there it is.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.260]   There's a black MacBook here.
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.780]   We actually have a little Easter egg contest.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.780]   Good times.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.420]   I can see all the fingerprints on that.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.260]   It actually is pretty disgusting.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.260]   We hide this.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.260]   That's the Vorex sweat right there.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.020]   Oh, pretty.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:27.340]   It's kind of gross, but it's good that you make him sweat.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.780]   He doesn't bring a computer when he comes in as the show.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.780]   So we have this.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.780]   This is the Vorex computer.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.700]   Do you have the simple finder on it?
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.260]   Make it as easy as possible.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.260]   Yeah, good.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.260]   Mmm.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.900]   Okay, so all right.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.900]   One more rumor.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.900]   iPhone 5 rumor.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.380]   September, sound right?
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.980]   I predict that there will be a new iPhone.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980]   That's right.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.980]   You know, I think...
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.180]   Well, I predict there will be a new iPad.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.180]   Ooh, good one.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.180]   Damn.
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.180]   I wish I'd guess that.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:02.460]   No, I mean, Apple traditionally has this fall event where they do announcements going into
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.460]   the holiday season.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.260]   They're not going to do a new iPhone in these years.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.500]   It's obviously not an iPhone announcement yet, so they're going to shift gears from the
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.300]   last few years.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:17.060]   It would make sense to have iOS 5, which is coming out this fall, again, come out around
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:23.020]   the time that they do new iOS hardware, which means iPhone, iPod touch, and who knows, maybe
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.540]   even an iPad rev, although there's a lot of debate about whether that will happen in
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.540]   the fall of the spring.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:32.060]   I do say I'm not subscribing to the 2500, 2560 by 1920.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.860]   Oh, that's rubbish.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:42.100]   I mean, I could see the outside edge would be 2048 by 1536, which is exactly twice the
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.900]   resolution that it is now.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.620]   And even that, I would have a hard time swallowing.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.940]   It's just so much CPU power.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.060]   It's not whether they can fit that into the LCD.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.060]   It just requires...
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.860]   That means everything has to run heavy.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:54.860]   Boy, genius report.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.940]   Oh, go ahead, Andy, and then I'll go like that.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.420]   I was just going to say, I mean, it would cost them power, it would cost them an actual
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:07.980]   component expense, and then yet to see iOS users say we absolutely want a higher resolution
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.220]   iPad display.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.060]   So it's hard to know where the win is going to be if they switch that kind of display.
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.060]   I'd love to look at it.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:17.300]   When I think about the difference, when I look at an old iPhone 3GS and my 4, I mean,
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.340]   it is striking for me, the difference.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.100]   But there's so many pixels on an iPad display that it is...
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.100]   They will do it.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.860]   No doubt they're going to do it at some point.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.380]   But yeah, I'm not sure when that point is.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.700]   And quite frankly, it's not as if they've got a product that isn't desperate in need
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.020]   of a refresh right now.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:38.300]   I guess, and I will say that if anything got close though, if they did that, I think everybody
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   else...
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.220]   If they were able to maintain the same price and double the resolution, I think all the
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.220]   other...
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.700]   I think everyone would just kind of give up.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.700]   Well, you saw Harry McCracken's...
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:52.340]   You saw Harry McCracken's excellent article yesterday, the day before, on what people...
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.340]   This isn't his technology, I just said, "Bloggen, I thought it was a good thing."
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.340]   I thought it was exactly right.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.780]   How are you going to get somebody to say, "I'm going to get something instead of an iPad
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   too."
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:04.620]   And it is very challenging, I think, even with some pretty good contenders right now.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.140]   Nothing is so good that you say, "Oh, that's much better than the iPad.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:11.260]   That's the question all the reviewers of all the competitors are tiptoeing around, right?
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.780]   Because if you're writing reviews of all the tablets, you want it to be a good story and
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.620]   you want it to be like there's a battle.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.380]   And then they go through the specs and all that.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.660]   And they get to the end and they're like, "Well, the one that...
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.660]   The Galaxy 10..."
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.740]   Somebody said, "Well, if you're an Android enthusiast, you would..."
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.060]   And basically what they're saying is, "No, there's no reason to buy this unless you just
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.460]   hate the iPad and you won an Android thing, which is valid, I suppose, but it's not a
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.460]   mass market kind of thing."
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:41.020]   And I just have to say, I was in the airport looking at all these people using iPads.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:46.660]   But there was one 10 minute break where I saw an 80 year old using an iPad and a 3 year
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.660]   old using an iPad.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.660]   And I was like, "I just don't see Android's crossing...
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.660]   I don't see these Android tablets crossing that."
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:57.540]   I've seen exactly one Android tablet in the wild used by a civilian.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.700]   I've seen millions of people using iPads.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.460]   I've also seen millions of people using Kindle's.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:08.940]   But I have seen exactly one Android tablet being used by a civilian in the wild.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.780]   So I thought Harry's take was really good, which is we need to ask the question, "Why
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.460]   would I buy this because consumers are?
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.660]   Why would I buy this instead of an iPad?
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.900]   And can you give me a good reason?"
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.340]   And all these rumors about the Amazon tablet.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.980]   I mean, that's the one where I think they might have a story about why you would buy it instead
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980]   of an iPad.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.780]   But with the Zoom and the Galaxy tab, it's sort of like, "Well, you buy this because
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.020]   you don't like Coke and you prefer Pepsi."
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.580]   And that's not a good enough reason.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.700]   You need a better reason when one of them has 90% of the market.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:40.060]   I honestly believe that every manufacturer has now thought that they'd have an easier
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.740]   time competing with the iPad than they did.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.140]   I've talked to people inside a couple of different manufacturers who have pretty much
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:53.020]   confirmed that they have essentially called a do-over for their tablet strategy, where
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.220]   they're saying that we've got stuff on the market.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.700]   There are already a pipeline, but we're going to be preparing new generation devices for
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:04.420]   2012 and 2013 and 2014 that assume that nothing that we assumed isn't any way applicable
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.420]   to the real world.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:10.060]   But it doesn't just feel like the MP3 player situation all over again.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.340]   I mean, where people kept on redesigning it and the iPod kept on moving forward and
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.340]   before you knew it, there wasn't...
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.780]   I mean, there's still MP3 players out there.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.780]   Someone's making them...
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780]   Yeah, but who buys them?
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780]   I know.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   But I know...
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.780]   But I know...
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.100]   That's the argument is that we keep on seeing them trying to figure this out and the problem
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.100]   is owning the hardware and owning... there's something to be said for owning the hardware
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.100]   and the software.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:32.260]   Okay, but the difference there is that an MP3 player is a unit-tacer.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.380]   All it has to do is sync up music and play it.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.420]   And so that's going to be hard to make any other company differentiate.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:44.040]   You notice that as soon as Android came out with a really good free operating system for
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:49.200]   mobile devices, the iPhone stopped being the only really decent multi-touch smartphone
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   in the market.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.900]   So I think that there is some room for a good tablet.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.660]   I do think that it's going to be a company like Amazon that's going to do it and not
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.000]   a company like HTC.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   I agree with you.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.800]   Because Amazon has really cracked the idea that you can't just give somebody... you can't
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.280]   just take 500 bucks for them, give them a tablet and say, "Good night and good luck.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.600]   I enjoy playing those flash games."
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.840]   You really have to give them an easy universe that says, "Here are great apps.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.840]   Here's great content.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.640]   Here's stuff you never have to worry about.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.440]   It will just simply tap this button and it'll figure out what it needs to contain."
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   Here are great ads.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.320]   This is the new ad for the iPhone.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.320]   Yep.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.200]   Oh, I think we don't have audio.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.800]   But it looks great.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.600]   But can you talk along with this?
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   Just do the narration.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600]   It really goes...
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.400]   Here's the... you got the FC.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   It's magical.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400]   That's the...
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.120]   You can talk on it.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.120]   You can learn on it.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.720]   And you can tell your parents you're using it just for schoolwork, like the Vatican's
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   guy, but really...
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.960]   It's every book ever.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.600]   And every star in the universe.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.760]   Look, it's a lion in the sky.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   Magical, just like that.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.000]   But it doesn't run lion.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Don't be confused.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.280]   As you see in the commercial, it never takes fingerprints and glare is always totally manageable.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   That would be 500 dollars, please.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.560]   But yeah, Apple's commercials are always about...
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.000]   Here are cool things you can do with the iPad.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.680]   All the Android tablet commercials are...
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   It runs flash.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.720]   It has the brutal four core processor.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   It's got over 12 bytes of cash RAM.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.120]   It's like, "Oh, wow."
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.720]   Your wife will love the Tegretu chipset.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.920]   Actual line from a commercial.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.600]   Your wife will love the Tegretu chipset.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.600]   Really?
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.600]   Really?
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   That's because my wife is here.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.960]   Because you're leaving her unfulfilled in so many ways.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   Unbelievable.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.800]   No, somebody Monday wrote a piece that was great that said, "Okay, there are two ways
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800]   this plays out.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.760]   Because the tablet market's actually the iPad market and it's going to be like MP3 players
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.120]   and Apple's going to have 85% of the market share."
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.120]   At least for the next year that's not the place out.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.120]   Scenario B is we're going to be in a scenario more like the phones where Apple will have
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120]   the leading...
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.120]   A couple of year advantage.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.800]   ...in terms of market share by physical product, right?
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.400]   They'll have 30%.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.600]   And then there'll be a bunch of other products out there.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.080]   What this piece said was, "Well, either way, this is very good news for Apple."
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.120]   That Apple's got this dominant position and that people who believe that the iPad is just
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.000]   going to fade away under the onslaught of Android tablets.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   That's not what's going to happen.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   I do think the Amazon thing could be huge because you have an Amazon username and a password
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.240]   just like you have an iTunes username and password.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.520]   They have movies.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.120]   The movie story, the multimedia story on Android is so far behind.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:31.720]   It'll be a good test to see whether it is the full circle e-commerce chain that makes
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.280]   the iPad a success or form factor.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280]   Right.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   It's two years before it.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.160]   Because we're going to have apps, I think.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.640]   I don't think that Amazon will be in...
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   Amazon's got their app store now, right?
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640]   But it's not...
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.640]   Here's the problem.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.640]   They're not as polished.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   No, but presumably if they do their own tablet, they're going to have their own app store app
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.000]   on the tablet.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   And that'll be more polished.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.760]   And they can be in the web interface.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760]   But it's the...
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:00.120]   It is all the APIs and the libraries and the interface and everything else.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.840]   It's not just that close circle.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.240]   Two years before the iPad came out, we were meeting with Korean companies to do this.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.240]   And we designed a tablet.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.240]   Right.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.240]   You know, like we were sitting there trying to figure out...
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.040]   Check crunch to the tablet.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.600]   And the thing is, is the reason that we stopped doing it is because we couldn't figure out
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   how to build the interface.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   Right.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600]   You know, and that's what Apple figured out how to do.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   It's not about the hardware.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   I was like, I can't...
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   You know, we just...
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.440]   Can I just say Andy called this?
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.920]   He said it at the very beginning of the year.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.160]   You said there's nobody in 2011 going to become...
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.840]   It's going to be competing competitive.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.280]   You said it and you were right.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   I stick with that.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   Actually, I think that now HP has the...
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   I'm impressed.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   That's the one I want to ask you about.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.520]   Yeah, because they seem to be...
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.880]   They seem to be taking the attitude that we're not all about apps and we're not all about
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   running Flash.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.160]   We are essentially saying that whatever you got, no matter where it is, we will be able
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.400]   to collate it into one screen and one experience, which could work out nicely.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   It's beautiful.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   I love WebOS.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.440]   No apps at all.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.440]   It could be compelling if once again it succeeds in having the simplest that it communicates
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   to people.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   But we'll see.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.000]   You've seen it in the pen rom so many times.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   This is the Nokia N9.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.080]   They just announced the new Nokia N9 with the MIGO operating system, which they've already
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.160]   said we're not going to make any more of them, so you're buying a dead end machine.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   It's beautiful.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160]   That's pretty.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.680]   But who the hell is going to buy that?
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   I think that you can make these things.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   You can make great hardware.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   It doesn't mean you're going to...
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.000]   Well, the thing that I think that you're still going to...
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   Buying something like the iPad is not just buying a physical item.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.640]   It's buying into the company, buying into what the company represents.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.200]   I don't think HP, as great as that HP touch, looks...
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.600]   It really looks good.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.800]   Do people trust HP to...
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.400]   Well, HP is not a bad brand, right?
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.720]   I mean, it's not the Apple brand, but it is a brand that people know and maybe they will
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.920]   trust it to a certain extent and they've got the good OS.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.720]   What's interesting is that the hardware is sort of a direct iPad 1 knockoff.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.280]   But maybe what they decided was...
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   It's still core though.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280]   Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.000]   But it looks like an iPad original.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   And that's okay.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.800]   I feel like they just said, "Look, this hardware is hardware that's proven and we're
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.360]   not going to try to change it.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.200]   We're going to do our good software on top of it and we've got a brand name and that's
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   where we're going to start."
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.280]   And there's some potential there.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.600]   Even though it's not the same brand, you know, glow that's around the Apple brand HP, there
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.720]   are people who like totally love HP and maybe that will work.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.920]   Those demos, if you watch those demos, I was watching them on Sunday.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.920]   They were really impressive.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.040]   And I think the big challenge for all of these guys is that what Apple does so well is not
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.760]   what they add to the product, is what they take out of the product.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:40.560]   And that's what they remove and to simplify the experience.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.800]   The fact that you have people who don't know how to use computers using iPads, the fact
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.320]   that you have kids using iPads, it's because they don't get lost and they don't run into
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.200]   a lot of dead ends where they can't figure out where to go next.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   And that's what Apple does really well.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.320]   And I haven't seen anybody else do that well until they do.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.040]   I don't think they can compete.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.160]   But also HP has an interesting component in that they've already announced that they're
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.560]   going to be putting WebOS on their desktops and on their notebooks as well.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.960]   And given how many of those things that they sell, when you're in a store in 2012 or 2013,
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.560]   and you can say, "By the way, if you just..."
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.320]   I know you're interested in probably buying a book reader or buying an iPad, realize that
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.440]   we won't handicap our notebooks by having it just run this mobile OS.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:26.480]   But as soon as you bring that thing home and bring it into your Wi-Fi halo of the house,
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   essentially everything that you've been doing and everything you've been playing with on
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.880]   your WebOS tablet will also be available right there on your notebook, including all the
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.880]   apps that you're running, not just all the data.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.640]   So it's all about the implementation, but the intention that they've explained a couple
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.120]   months ago about their hopes for WebOS announces that they're really going to be pretty ambitious.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.480]   So they're going to infect their desktops with it.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.920]   That's a pretty serious mojo they're trying to put in there.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.800]   Dear Mr. Jobs, I will say this one more time.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.960]   You do understand English, don't you?
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.440]   I do not sell my soul for Apple or any other company.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.480]   I have no interest in changing the world, as you suggest.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:07.640]   You have nothing that I need or want your computer salesmen and I am effing James Bond!
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   All the best Sean Connery.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.920]   I admit I don't do a great Sean Connery, but this is a great letter which is a fake.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   It's a fake.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920]   But it's funny.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920]   Great!
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:23.040]   From 1998, remember that "Think Different" hears to the crazy ones.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.240]   And I guess Bond was in that one?
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240]   Was he in that one?
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240]   No, no.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.240]   What was Connery?
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.040]   This was like an onion-like website where they basically said, "Imagine that they tried
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.280]   to get Connery in an I-Mag commercial."
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280]   Oh, a rock.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   From the dust, from the strong corner.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.080]   I don't think he was thinking of himself as James Bond in the late '90s.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.280]   In fact, that was the last thing he would want to think of himself as.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280]   It's 15 years after his ever seen every time.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.880]   I think in 1998, it would have been a good time for him.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.400]   How many times have you wanted to say, "I am Efren James Bond?"
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.760]   We have a great day ahead of us today, comrades.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.920]   And there is the title for our show today.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   You failed the history.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.160]   There, you do a much better job.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.480]   You got to do the Red October.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.280]   That is the definitive late season Connery is the Red October.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.280]   He reads from the Bible.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.280]   He starts in Russian.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.720]   He ends up in a Scottish accent inexplicably.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.720]   There's a Scottish Bible.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.320]   I don't know what happened there.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.320]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   Come back with more.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.400]   If I've missed any major stories, I'll tell you what, I'll go around the horn.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.080]   Andy, any big stories that you wanted to talk about that I'm about to leave at the dust?
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.560]   Only that Dropbox decided to leave everybody's doors unlocked for obviously yesterday.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.560]   Rob Monday.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.200]   That's quite a slip up.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:35.800]   That's going to be on Tash.0 as one of those wacky videos.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.120]   Apparently, they're doing some maintenance.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:42.720]   They fixed what they thought was one authentication issue, which unfortunately had a bug in it
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   that were really fixed.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:50.240]   For four hours, Dropbox was not checking passwords.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.480]   So if you've been waiting to like, work up everybody's Dropbox content, you could have
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   done it.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.680]   They have a status page, right, where you can actually see what happened on your account
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.520]   like file by file.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.120]   So if you're really worried that somebody accessed it, you can go and go through your
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   history and see.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.920]   Also, they said that they've already done an internal audit and anybody who had some
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.880]   unusual activity during the period in which the accounts were open have received an email.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.440]   But man, it's not just about that.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.440]   It's the trust issue.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.800]   It really is a cautionary tale for Apple that the one feature they absolutely, absolutely
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:30.240]   have to get right with iCloud is to make sure that there is no way or excuse me, next
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.360]   to no way possible for anybody to be able to look at your files without a court order
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.280]   or without the statement.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.920]   Yeah, this bank of service is on fire and we'd really, really, really like to make sure
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.160]   you don't lose your file so that we're going to take these eight server clusters and move
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.440]   them out into the front lawn.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.080]   I know that violates our terms of service, but that's what it's supposed to do.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.800]   The first time that there is, this isn't the first time that in 2011 when Dropbox has
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.400]   had to clarify their statement that your data is private and secure.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.720]   And so, man, they are not going to recover a third time.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.240]   It's kind of sad.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.360]   Alex, any stories that I missed that you would like to bring up before we...
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.920]   I was kind of fixated on Final Cut this morning.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.280]   Yeah, what a surprise.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.720]   Yeah, I didn't really do...
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.720]   Thursday, Thursday, Thursday.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.720]   How about you, Jason?
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.880]   Anything that big that we...
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.200]   I think the Dropbox thing is the big thing.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   That's a big story.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.600]   And that's just for anything you keep in the cloud.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.680]   We talk about the clouds.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.760]   Little Rain has fallen from the clouds.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   I know.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   That's what we think.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.200]   I love Dropbox, but it is anything you put somewhere that is not under your control is
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.280]   fundamentally insecure in some ways, and you either got to learn to accept it or encrypt
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   the stuff you put there or don't use it.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.440]   And good point, Eddie, that this is something iCloud cannot let happen.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.720]   I've just always said that there are only two states.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.400]   There is on the internet and not on the internet.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.480]   And if something is on the internet, it doesn't matter that it's in your private cloud storage.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.960]   It doesn't matter that there's...
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.720]   You chose a 20-character, a half-new...
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.640]   Text and numbers, password to protect it.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.720]   It doesn't even necessarily matter that you encrypted the file.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.680]   If it's on the internet, assume that other people can get access to it and read it.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.960]   That's the difference between those two states.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.000]   I work at Apple in our chat room, which pretty much means he doesn't work at Apple.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.920]   Says, "You're going to talk about Ron Johnson leaving Apple for JCPenney's."
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.840]   That's kind of an interesting move.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.080]   He needed a new blouse.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.080]   It's not like he was going to become CEO of Apple.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.920]   I mean, everyone's moving up the chain, and he's not going to become CEO of Apple.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.320]   He's a retail guy, right?
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.600]   I mean, how much more could he do after taking Apple?
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.080]   It's a retail from zero to what it is today, which is...
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.000]   I mean, if there is a single success that Apple's had, I would say, in the last 10 years,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.680]   the biggest one is not even the iPhone.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.680]   It's retail.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.480]   It is... everybody thought that would fail, and instead it's been like the driver of so
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480]   much of Apple's success.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.520]   Most lucrative retail in the world per square foot.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.620]   It's amazing.
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:55.520]   But Ron Johnson's a retail guy, he came from Target, and what's his next step?
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   Tim Cook is the...
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520]   Saving JCPenney would be pretty impressive.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   Is the C.O.O.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520]   That would be a hell of a thing.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.280]   He put his own money into JCPenney's stock options.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.280]   He did, but a lot of them.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:07.080]   So I think for a retail guy, he proved all he could at Apple, and he wants to take the
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.160]   big chair.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.800]   It's an interesting choice at JCPenney, but he must figure that there's value there that
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800]   he can...
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.880]   So it's bad for Apple, but I'm sure he's got a good team around him, and he built it.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.000]   Now they have to run it.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.280]   Also in the chatroom, the chatroom's great.
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.640]   I love you guys, because you don't let us get away with anything.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:31.320]   A reminder from Curtis B, that we have now seen information from Apple, kind of unofficial
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.840]   back-channel information from Apple, that if you're in business or education, that there
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.800]   will be a way to do multiple installs of Lion.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.040]   We thought there would be, because the dev version of Lion has that image that you can
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.040]   install.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.640]   They say there is an app when you install OS 10 Lion from the App Store, there's actually
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.040]   an app that gets put in applications called install OS 10 Lion.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.240]   You can take that and install it in other places.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.440]   I think Apple wanted to simplify their message and say, "It's a download."
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.240]   No, no, it's a download, but there are going to be other ways.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240]   Of course.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240]   That was a given.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.640]   We're going to take a break, come back with your picks of the week gentlemen.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.920]   So please start thinking, as I do, just seconds before we actually have to do the pick.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.080]   No, you've already got picks.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.720]   You guys are impressive.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:18.360]   Before we do that, I do want to have a pick for you from audible.com.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:22.640]   I've been lately driving to San Francisco many days, and it reminds me of the good old
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.680]   days when I used to commute every day to San Francisco.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.800]   An audible just saved my bacon.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   Audible is still for me.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:37.680]   The only way to travel if I'm on a plane, even if I'm only traveling on a treadmill.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.880]   A treadmill to nowhere.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.640]   I'm listening to audiobooksfromaudible.com.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.200]   I just love audible.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:50.400]   Now over 70,000 books, including the incredible Samuel L. Jackson, go the F to sleep, which
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   is free, by the way.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400]   So go ahead and get a copy.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   Do they put the whole book up there?
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.880]   They put the whole thing up there for free.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.440]   I saw a video on YouTube and it was--
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   It's hysterical, isn't it?
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.280]   Well, it's only six minutes.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.280]   If you're a parent--
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   You've got to have this.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.280]   I actually--
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   Don't play it for your kids.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280]   I was not a kids' book.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.200]   Who is the bookstore with my daughter yesterday?
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.040]   And I said, oh, look, they've got go to the F to sleep.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.760]   And she said, no, no parent would actually buy that for their kids.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.440]   I said, no, no, no, no, but every parent who's ever had a kid will buy it for themselves.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.240]   I told someone that on the plane yesterday.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.640]   I said, you're not going to win parent of the year award by reading your kid that book
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.920]   and he goes, you're obviously not from New York.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.400]   Hey, go to F to sleep.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.040]   Anyway, that's kind of nice that audible made that available for a free, but there are

[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.760]   so that book is free.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.600]   I don't know if you have a pick, Andy, but I've got to mention that they have now the
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.760]   10th anniversary full cast production of Neil Gaiman's American Gods on here.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.280]   And this is one of my favorite books.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:04.560]   Just came out today and it's fully and acted out, which I love.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.240]   And I know you're a Neil Gaiman fan, so I got to figure, Andy, that this must have
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   been on your little.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.240]   Oh, I see what's on your list.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.360]   I'll add that one too.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.440]   So we're going to give you two choices.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.880]   This just came out.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.200]   I hadn't seen it before.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.080]   I actually read the original on audible and I loved it and I would highly recommend it.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.400]   But Andy's got a recommendation all his own.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.840]   And this is a really cool one.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.160]   It's Solaris by Stanislaw Lem.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:32.720]   A lot of people have seen the George Clooney movie from about 10 years ago.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:39.120]   This is one of my favorite science fiction novels because unlike some of the leading
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.520]   lights of science fiction and I'm including Arthur C. Clark in the stuff, this book is
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.960]   not about how fascinated this author is by how an escalator would work on a space station.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.640]   It really is just about people and human beings.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:58.320]   And the fact that they are on a space station, we're bringing a really mysterious, interesting
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.080]   ocean planet that they're researching is just sort of incidental to the human stories
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.440]   in there.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.360]   And so there's too much going on in the novel that I don't really want to give much of the
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:14.240]   way, except for again, it's a very, very human story that in some ways, in some places,
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.760]   it's just so heartbreaking because you can see yourself in the position of the lead character
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.520]   of the narrator of this book, someone who has lost people in his life that are just heartbreaking
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:32.800]   in the popability of this lost, let's say, that he feels when he's at the space station.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.480]   And suddenly, there's at least one, the first time I read it, there was at least one Pixar
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:42.840]   moment where it's like, "Okay, I didn't think I'd be crying, but I'll say no crying."
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.200]   But I first read this book about 20 years ago.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.760]   And later on, I found out that there's actually controversy regarding Solaris was originally
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.200]   written in Polish, and then somebody took the Polish version and translated it into French.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.920]   And then in 1970, someone translated the French translation into English.
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.520]   And it was supposedly kind of a poor translation, and Lem has been very, very upset about it
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520]   ever since.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:12.360]   Audible actually commissioned the first direct translation direct from Polish to England.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.920]   So it is the author approved translation.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.160]   It is also a really nicely read and really nicely acted book.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.160]   I'm only...
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.840]   My lieutenant, Lieutenant Guy, how do you pronounce that?
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.840]   Guy, Guy Ton?
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.840]   Data.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840]   Data.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.840]   From B.S.G.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.840]   Right.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.320]   The curly head, the cute one.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   Right.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   And it's...
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   It means it's...
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.320]   Go ahead.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   No, it's wonderfully done.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   I'm only about...
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   It's a seven-hour book.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   I'm only about an hour and a half into it.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   But already, it's the...
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.320]   I'm not the best at that I can go back onto the highway and loop around and get to the
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320]   end of this chapter.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.920]   I know I'm only about a quarter-mile from the home, but I can...
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.200]   It's worth spending another 80 cents per the gas just to listen to the next...
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.600]   Get to the end of the chapter.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.200]   I have it on my iPhone already.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.600]   I am very excited about listening to it.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.600]   Solaris.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.720]   There's two good picks, the definitive edition and a brand new 10th anniversary edition of
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720]   American Gods.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.760]   You're going to have to pick one.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.040]   But you know, the good news is next month, you get another book.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.040]   Double.com/MacBreak.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.040]   Give it a try today.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.040]   We are big fans.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   You can see Andy and I just...
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.840]   And you, I know Alex.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.520]   We love our audible.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.400]   I don't know how I'd get my house cleaned up or anything else.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.200]   That's what I'd do with yard work, cleaning, driving.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.600]   Those are the things that I use it for.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.600]   Let us get...
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.880]   Actually, let's have our guest do his pick of the week.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.080]   Jason Snell, editor in chief.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.080]   Macworld Mac.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.080]   Exciting.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.360]   My pick is a $5 utility called Moom, which is a palindrome, which is nice.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.320]   Same forward and backward.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   Moom.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   Moom.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.480]   It's short for Moom and Zoom.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.960]   And it's utility from many tricks, which speaking of Rob Griffiths, who used to work
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.080]   from Macworld, he is now a software developer guy.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.440]   He and Peter Maurer do these utilities.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.720]   Now, or did Butler, which is an incredible program.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.280]   And it turns out that a lot of his ideas were conversations with Rob.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.160]   And Rob would be like, "You know, because he's kind of cranky."
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.400]   He'd be like, "I wish it did this."
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.320]   And Peter would be like, "Say, that's an interesting idea."
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.720]   And then there'd be a utility like the next day.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.880]   So now they work together.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:19.320]   And Moom is a great utility that basically hijacks your green button in the top left
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:26.760]   corner of your Mac, every window, and lets you move and Zoom windows very quickly to be
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:32.080]   the bottom half of your screen, the side half, the upper left hand corner.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.320]   And once you start using it, you really get used to it.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.480]   And there are a bunch of utilities that do this, but this is really elegantly designed.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   It doesn't get in your way.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.240]   It really only manifests when you move over that green button.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.640]   And then you can send your windows.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.160]   So if you want to quickly tile your screen, send something off to the left.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.400]   It's five bucks from many tricks.com.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.400]   Or the app store.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400]   Or the app store.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   That's right.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   Or maybe it's only on the app store.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.000]   No, it's five bucks everywhere.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   So it's cheap.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.640]   I just buy stuff on the app store now because then the app, I don't have to worry about updates.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:01.640]   Exactly.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.640]   But it's good.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.280]   I really had a whole bunch of utilities that I was trying to find the right one.
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.040]   But the only one, only option was it had to be on the app store.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.040]   Moom looks great.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.040]   Moom is great if you're doing captures too.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.280]   Because you get everything to pop over to a certain window.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.920]   So if you're only using part of it for a screen capture.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.880]   If you're organized, if you'd like to have your screen organized, Moom is really smart.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.080]   And it is implemented in the way that if Apple thought this was a mainstream feature,
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.520]   it would do it because it's very subtle.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.720]   It's not a crazy kind of menu bar.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:27.720]   It's got a menu bar thing.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.440]   But basically, it all happens over the green button.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.920]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.960]   And if it's Final Cut Pro 10, I'm going to yell at you.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   It's not.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   Okay.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   It's a complimentary thing to Final Cut.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   Okay.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   That's right.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   I like that.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   Two little picks.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   One is Filmic Pro.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.360]   Have you seen Filmic Pro?
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.560]   So Filmic Pro is a, it's for your iPhone.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:52.560]   And it is a little video recording.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   I think it does still as well.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.240]   But video recording where you can basically have independent control over your exposure,
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.520]   over your focus.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.200]   And it's just a, it's a great heads up display.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.720]   It's just a really nice interface for shooting movies on your, on your iPhone.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   I think it's so beautiful.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.960]   So you use this for all your movies now?
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   I'm just starting to.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.120]   Yeah, I'm starting to use it for a lot of them.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.360]   I, you know, I'm always changing what I'm using, updating it.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.240]   And this is my current favorite.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.600]   And so it's called Filmic Pro.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.760]   Definitely check that out.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.800]   And the other thing is if you're getting Final Cut Pro, which I think a lot of people
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.480]   are, you're going to be wanting to figure out where there is some training because you're
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.320]   going to, this is a completely new thing.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.080]   And my real pick here is ripple, go to ripple training.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.360]   And you got to check, these are our guys for our show that do this kind of training.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.440]   You know, Steve Martin and Mark Spencer.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.520]   And it's just great, great training.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.760]   This is the only training that I, you know, that I've seen so far for, for Final Cut Pro
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:43.760]   10.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.760]   And great little videos.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:49.800]   There's a ton of free stuff that's already on their website as well as, you know, a ton
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:55.640]   of stuff that you can buy for very inexpensively for your iPad or your computer to play it.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.600]   And if you're trying to get ramped up on this, I think a lot of our listeners are going
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.600]   to be...
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.760]   So I could put this on my iPad and watch while I have Final Cut Pro 10 on my desktop.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   I think that's the way to do it.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760]   Exactly.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.760]   That is the way to do it.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.760]   So anyway, definitely check that out.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   Ripple training.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.480]   I just, these, there are hosts for Mac Break Studio.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.160]   And they literally launched it.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.120]   They've been, I think they pulled an all-nighter to get it up today.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.160]   So, so anyway, so definitely, definitely check it out.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.160]   Good.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.280]   I think I know where I'm going.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.280]   Yep.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.280]   Mr. Andy, how can that go?
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.080]   Your pick of the week.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.880]   As of last night, it was going to be MoOM because I too discovered...
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880]   Oh, how funny.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.080]   You didn't like it a lot.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.000]   You didn't put it in the Google Doc though.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   No, no, no.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   That's fine.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.520]   That's why for 20 minutes there was in that line of the Google Doc.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520]   I saw that curse you, Jason Snow.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520]   You're Jason Snow.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.400]   Damn, you're there.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.840]   And I did actually have a second like traditional pick, but I suddenly realized that I really
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:57.080]   want to choose pages both for Mac and for iOS as my pick of the week because over the
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:03.360]   past few months, it really has become a much more important word processor for me.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.240]   Not necessarily because they've made such significant info.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.640]   They've enhanced it in any significant way over the past few months, but simply that
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:17.680]   now the world that it lives in makes an app like pages more urgent.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.640]   The idea of having one application, one word processor where there's a desktop version,
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.760]   there is a tablet version, and then there's a phone version that all try to be as equal
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.840]   to each other as they possibly can.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.040]   I still absolutely love Scrivener.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.560]   It's been like my main word processor ever since Mr. Snow showed it to me two or three
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.560]   years ago.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:42.800]   But now I'm in that awful sort of middle ground where there are some projects for which I prefer
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:48.320]   to have pages and there's some projects for which I prefer to have Scrivener.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:53.560]   The iPad book that I'm waist deep in with the water rising right now is being written
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.240]   in pages because I do need a little bit more sophisticated formatting.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.000]   And also because when I travel, I need to be able to be able to edit the actual rich
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.840]   document on whatever device I have.
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.240]   And now that I'm looking forward to looking ahead to next year and thinking that now
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.560]   there's going to, by the end of this year, there's going to be iCloud fully enabled
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.440]   for all iOS devices.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.800]   That will be a world in which I don't have to worry about exporting anything.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:21.320]   I don't have to worry about copying anything to my Dropbox simply the virtue of the fact
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.600]   that at some point in the history of this document, I've said that this is one of those
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.760]   documents that I like to be able to edit wherever I am.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:32.560]   As soon as I get without doing anything, the iPad that I grabbed them away out the door
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.400]   and on my way to the big old place with the Wi-Fi has the latest version of it.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.360]   And when I get back home, I also don't have to sync, I don't have to export, don't have
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.360]   to do anything.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:44.160]   The version on my desktop will have the exact same document with all those edits and all
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.280]   the things that's really going to make a big difference.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.080]   So it really puts me in the quandary because as I said, I love, love, love Scribner.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:57.560]   But if literature and latte doesn't do a fully iCloud-studified version of it, that's
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.960]   really going to change.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   That's really going to upset the balance of power between word processing apps.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:06.720]   And the last thing is, even if you're not, don't use word processors that way, it is
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:11.760]   one hell of a powerful word processor.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.960]   It's the first really bottom-up rethink of how a word processor should really function
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.360]   that I've seen in the past four or five years.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:26.320]   Just the other day, I was looking at a brochure or some sales materials for one of the upcoming
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.840]   books and thought, well, of course, it would have been done in sort of a more complicated
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.840]   app.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.200]   But nope, the person did it in pages.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.520]   Chiefly because you can just simply drag things around and things will automatically
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.680]   resize, replace themselves.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:44.600]   Almost there's very little that you can do on the desktop that you can't do in the mobile
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.880]   app or in the other app.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.040]   The fact that it has a really good ePub export feature where if you want to have a perfectly
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:56.360]   credible book version of whatever it is that you're developing with illustrations, with
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:00.280]   formatting and tech, you can just click on export and you will get a perfectly credible
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   eBook.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.640]   If you want to put a little bit of effort into it, you can make it even better.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:08.600]   But it is a really nice one-click, saleable eBook thing.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:13.840]   The more I'm forced to work inside pages, the more impressed I am with how functional
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.080]   and how flexible it is.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.960]   I really do think I'm going to have a hard decision coming up later in the year when I
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.560]   cloud iOS 5 and line are both active at the exact same time.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:28.480]   Actually, I just downloaded Nisys 10, which is the -- or Nisys Pro that was a recommendation
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.880]   last week.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.480]   I don't know what to do.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.720]   We standardized on high work, I think.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.920]   High work is pretty impressive.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:39.120]   You go back to the old ones and you're like, I'm just using pages, numbers, and you know
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120]   what I'm just like.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.200]   I hate pages, sorry.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.200]   I don't.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.520]   I write everything in Scrivener or BB Ed.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:49.120]   The good news is that Scrivener, from literature and latte, they are working on an iPad version.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.320]   And Andy's point, yeah, they've got to do -- I don't know when it's coming out, but
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.240]   they said they're going to do it.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.240]   They got to do iCloud.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.240]   The hooks are there, right?
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.360]   It's not -- Apple's let you do it.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:02.560]   Yeah, there are APIs for those developers to hook into.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:05.560]   That would be huge, because that is the one thing I miss with Scrivener is that you can't
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.320]   kind of figure with you in rich times.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.760]   I'd have to double check.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.480]   I'm glad you learned me to that, because I'll check the blog.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.840]   Last time I said -- no, I'm saying that the author had categorically said that he has
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.000]   no interest in doing an iPad version, that they're doing -- they're hoping to make it
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.280]   -- actually, they quoted me by saying, we prefer the pack of lunch idea of exporting
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.800]   just what you're working on from your current Scrivener project.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.640]   I think I remember him -- maybe I'm remembering him.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:32.280]   I think I remember him saying that he finally kind of broke down and said, all right, we're
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.560]   going to do a Windows version and we're going to do an iPad version.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.280]   But maybe -- I don't know what the timeframe is there.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.720]   I hope they are, because they need to.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.360]   That means somebody needs to do that.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.960]   It is getting tough, because -- and apart from anything else, Pages really is -- I'm shocked
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.600]   and stunned to be able to have to say this almost a year and a half after the iPad was
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.240]   first released.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.560]   It really still is the only rich text formatted word processor for the iPad that's worth the
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560]   damn.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.520]   Until iOS 5 comes out, because now there's going to be rich text editing built into iOS
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   5.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.080]   And just like we saw this plague of plain text editors on the iPad, pretty soon we'll be
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.720]   seeing a plague of rich text editors on the iPad.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.640]   I would just love to see them take -- me too, writer.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.640]   -- Pages.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.640]   -- Point making.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.640]   Much more of a developer.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.080]   Like, develop real interactive titles with other pages or keynotes for the iPad.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.840]   We need a platform to make that easy.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:25.720]   Right now there's no -- I believe Adam and Tanya angst to Andy's point about EPUBs.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.640]   I think all their kick-tick control books now are built using Pages, because the EPUB
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.720]   is that -- it's really good output for EPUB publishers.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.720]   -- I was surprised.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:41.360]   I was arbitrarily -- I've been trying to learn how to hand-coast in -- for EPUB, using CSS,
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.840]   using styles, using all these other cool stuff.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:47.640]   And it was just almost heartbreaking, the fact that I want to do things like I want to be
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.120]   able to have like a call-out text box that moves along with the text.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.320]   And man, that is so far beyond my skills of coding for CSS, to make it work consistently.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:00.440]   Whereas with pages, you just simply draw a box, put text inside it, put a graphic inside
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.840]   it, put a little clock on it, pointing out the little box.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.480]   And when you export it as an EPUB, there will be a box with text in it with a little clock
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.560]   pointing out the text that will fall or long with your text as easy as you please.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.840]   And that's -- man, that is a fairly sophisticated feature to have on a simple click to export
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.080]   to EPUB feature.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:20.240]   -- Oh, and one other thing I wanted to say about Fantasticow, which was a pick -- was that
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240]   yours, Andy?
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.240]   -- Yeah, that was mine.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.400]   -- They have now updated it, and "BusyCal" has updated it so it now works with "BusyCal,"
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.360]   which is good news because I'm a busy cal fanatic.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.680]   So now I am a Fantasticow user as well.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:33.840]   Hey, we thank everybody for being here.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.640]   I have to go play with Final Cut X.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.640]   -- So cool.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   Just so cool.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.640]   -- Doesn't it look pretty?
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.640]   -- With it, yes.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:41.640]   And this is --
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.440]   -- So look at the -- Oh, set that to --
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440]   -- Wow.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.960]   -- Yeah, pretty exciting, huh?
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.400]   Look what I've already done.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400]   Do what?
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.640]   -- I think that's pretty good.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.800]   Look at all the different ones there.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.800]   RGVectorscope.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800]   -- Waveform.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   -- Waveform.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:58.240]   -- It doesn't help, Leo.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.080]   -- No, it still looks dopey.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.320]   Now can I split these screens out, Alex and Tuna?
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.840]   -- Yeah, you can -- RGB?
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.160]   -- No, I just want, for instance, if I have a bigger monitor or two monitors to take that
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160]   over there.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160]   -- I haven't checked that over there.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160]   -- Yeah, I would love to be able to detach these.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.160]   I presume I can.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.160]   -- I don't know if you can.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.160]   -- Well, that would suck.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   -- Well, I don't know.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.160]   -- Well, I've only had one.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:36.420]   is
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.940]   and the old studio.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.000]   I can't wait to be in a new studio.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.320]   You're going to be on our, like, big round table set,
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:45.560]   we've got this phony jib that we can get one intern
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.120]   in one corner, another intern and they play catch,
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.400]   and then the camera goes slowly zoom.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.700]   It's just- it's great, wait until you see it.
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.720]   It's the weirdest think you've ever seen in your life.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.720]   Jason, I hope you will come back and visit us.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.720]   I would love to.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.320]   It's nice when people are here.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.360]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.640]   There's actually how many?
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.120]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven people,
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.600]   in a room that was really designed for one.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.120]   Yeah, we're a fire hazard basically.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.760]   This is a fire marshall ever comes or dead.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:12.880]   Jason Snow is editor in chief.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.440]   I have Macworld Magazine.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.040]   You can also find him at macworld.com.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.240]   He's on the Twitter at JSNL.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:18.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:19.240]   Thank you.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:19.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.040]   I hope you come back very soon.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.560]   Alex Lindsey's doing that whole Final Cut Pro 10 thing.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.960]   On Thursday evening, 6 p.m.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.040]   They're abouts, something like that.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.720]   Follow Pixelcore, C-O-R-P-S or me, Alex Lindsey.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.400]   And we'll post the links and everything else to it.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.400]   I can't wait.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.600]   Because as you can see, while I am pretty good at it,
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.200]   I need some more fine tuning.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.200]   Some training.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.200]   Well, the big thing is, this is also
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.560]   going to be a place for you to ask questions.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.560]   These guys really know what they're talking about.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.480]   And so you'll be able to watch the video,
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.240]   but it's not going to be like you're just watching.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.400]   We're going to be answering questions
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.640]   from everyone who's interactive.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.560]   And that's why we do everything live.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.120]   Because more and more I want to be interactive
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.520]   with our audience.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.040]   Except for this guy, Mr. Andy Enocho.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.720]   For him, interactivity is just playing the ukulele
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.280]   and smiling.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.160]   I prefer inactivity to interactivity.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.120]   And of course, sugared Pepsi.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.480]   We thank you for being here.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.560]   And we hope you will all come back next week.
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.600]   But meanwhile, get back to work.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.560]   Because break time is over.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:25.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.860]   (upbeat music)
