[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.560]   Ooh, this is really a little weird.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.480]   I feel bad for Renee Richie from iMore.com because he is not here.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.700]   He's here, but he's in the Skype machine, which puts him at a slight disadvantage because
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700]   look who is here.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.560]   Andy Nocko is in studio with us.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   Oh, girl.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   See the ball?
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   I should probably sit like this.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   He'll wish you.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   It's much better.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   Where is that guy?
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   Look at that.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.720]   He's got back on his head.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.560]   And Alex Lindsey is in studio.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Hello.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   Hello.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   So Andy, you're in town because you went to Sal Seguian's dinner on the 27th on West
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   Friday.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.760]   Yep, on Friday, which was what a great hooten, Andy.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.960]   It was 60 people.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.200]   And all of them are people who think that Sal is really cool and who love him.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.960]   So that's about the best group of people he can possibly spend any time with.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   I don't think they could find 60 people in the entire world that don't feel that way.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   Exactly.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   That's really neat.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   Sal was there, Naomi.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   His wife.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120]   Sal was there.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.800]   Sal was of course he knew that the event was happening.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.680]   And he also was told he knew that there are going to be 50 or 60 people here, but he was
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.480]   still I think he was still expecting like eight people at like a bank get in a restaurant.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.120]   So he was he was very, very touched to see this crowd of support.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120]   It was a big room.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   His family was there.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120]   His parents were there.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   It was really great.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   Great.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.640]   Of course, Sal left Apple was pushed out of Apple December, at least that's when we got the
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   announcement in December.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.520]   And he is the man in charge of Automator.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.200]   He was an Apple script guru.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.000]   In fact, you introduced me to him, Alex Lindsey, because he was also the host of the earliest
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Mac breaks.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   He was on Mac break with us from the yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.560]   We did a whole series with Sal about Automator and Apple script.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560]   Really cool and really great guy.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.240]   And we've been on some cruises with him.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.240]   Nice fella.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.160]   Anyway, it's nice to have your funeral before you die.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.400]   So a couple of people there are a lot of testimonials.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   Some of the present had to be caution that, yeah, look, stop using the past 10.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440]   Sal hasn't even retired.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.320]   He's now really, really busy spreading his saleness to other projects.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.520]   We can't talk about it, right?
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   We can't talk about it.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.720]   I was up very, very, very, very late the night after that.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.680]   Him showing me some really amazing stuff.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.960]   Oh, he showed you.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.120]   Oh, he didn't keep a secret from you, just from us.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.160]   Well, it's easier than having me rummaging through his office, having to go to bed.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.160]   He knows a good reporter.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   He's one.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.200]   At two o'clock this afternoon in our time, about two and a half hours from right now,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   Apple will do.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   It's a quarterly earnings report.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.120]   And that means probably Renee, you'll have to run.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   We talked about this last quarter.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.840]   They sent out a press release like half an hour earlier.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   Yes.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   So yeah, one-thirty your time.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   The press release should hit.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   Okay.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.320]   We'll see if they've run out of zeros yet.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.520]   What do we expect?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.360]   If they gave guidance, it was going to continue to be slow for the iPhone, right?
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.800]   I mean, the headline is Apple returns to growth, which is really funny when you're thinking
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.000]   about whatever the revenue actually is.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   It's in more billions of dollars than almost every other company makes when you combine
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   them together into one giant pot.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.920]   But when you make that amount of money, it's hard to keep making more money at the same
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.880]   astronomical acceleration rate.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.920]   And that's really what Wall Street is about, your short-term, near-term growth.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   So it's a holiday quarter.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.320]   They're coming off the iPhone 7 and the new Mac.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   Oh, that'll be big.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.160]   Well, it'd be as big as last quarter or the quarter before.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   Bum, bum, bum.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.120]   Stay tuned.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.560]   And iPhone, do they...
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   So what should we look for?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.600]   Should we be watching?
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160]   What would be good news?
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.360]   What would be bad news?
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   iPhone sales up quarter to quarter?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.760]   I guess yes, because it's a new iPhone.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   Quarter to quarter, absolutely.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.560]   Year over year, especially year over a couple of years.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.680]   They've been talking about the difficulties of the compare, the year over year compare,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.280]   because iPhone 6 sucked so many people forward that it made iPhone 6s' job really difficult.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.720]   Because people who would have waited ended up buying earlier.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.880]   So now, people still believe the super cycle is next year, that people are going to be
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.600]   waiting for whatever Apple does for the iPhone 8.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.000]   So it's going to see how many people actually bought iPhone 7 this year, especially during
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.200]   that holiday quarter.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   And also, Apple Watch is going to be a huge question this year because Fitbit did not
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   have a great quarter.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.240]   It had actually a really bad quarter.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   In fact, laid off 120 people I think yesterday.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.840]   And when Android Wear got delayed, that became smartwatches are doomed, regardless of how
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   Apple performs.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.360]   Now, if Fitbit is having problems, that becomes fitness wearables and watches are doomed,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.720]   regardless of Apple performs.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   So I think if Apple performs strongly, then it becomes more of a, this is an iPad and not
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.760]   a tablet story the way, and it's an Apple Watch and not necessarily a fitness wearable
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   story.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   110 people later.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.280]   And Apple doesn't really give us a lot of stats specifically on the watch though, right?
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   They never break it out.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.120]   No, you have to define it based on other income.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.040]   But I think the estimate is a sold, millions of them again.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   And they might have hit 24 million overall.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.520]   And it's still a very much a growing category.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.200]   It's still not part of people's regular buying cycle.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.960]   It's been three years since I bought my last smartwatch, it's time to buy a new one.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.840]   They're still trying to convince people to buy their first one.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.640]   What else would we be looking for?
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.200]   Why are you signing the business?
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   Mac rebound because Mac didn't do so well, but Apple didn't release any Macs.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.440]   And Apple tends to be MacBook Pro is not really a holiday product, but there's been
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.520]   such pent up demand for it and there were no new desktop Macs.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.840]   So how much did that hurt them versus how much did MacBook Pro finally shipping?
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.520]   It helped them in that quarter.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:27.320]   We're already seeing news that the Macintosh is having its first kind of...
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.040]   Apple dropped in computer sales to fifth place, I think.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.400]   When you don't ship it, it affects your sales.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.200]   Yeah, that probably doesn't have anything that doesn't include the new MacBooks, I would
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   imagine.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:48.360]   But PC shipments kind of stabilized, in fact, some companies went up and Apple went continued.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   It continued to skid.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.200]   I don't know that I would blame Apple that much for it because I think that we're really
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.840]   seeing Apple decide that they don't even necessarily want to sell Macs to everybody who
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   buys computers.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.640]   It seems to me like they're starting to think about who are the people who tend to buy Macs
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.800]   and what kind of Macs do they tend to buy.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.560]   So they might be kind of okay with saying that we are basically putting our focus into
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.200]   maximizing our value to the people who are still excited about Mac and still putting
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.880]   all the money into the iOS devices and the watch devices, which they really seem to be
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.400]   most excited about, at least internally.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.720]   I think that still the churning conversation in some of the email lists that I'm on is
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:38.560]   exactly who the MacBook Pro is aimed at because it's not powerful enough for what would be
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.960]   considered traditionally the pro consumer market to dive into it.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:51.080]   And so a lot of folks that I know are testing the Razer is the big one that I watch.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   Yeah, that's the biggest.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   I mean, that's the biggest.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.280]   No, I guess if you're using Lightroom or Photoshop, it's probably right.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.480]   Well, it creates a lot of, for folks that are really building pro apps, it creates some
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.840]   complexity because we have people going, "Where do we go?
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   What do we do?"
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.800]   Well, and for the developers, how do we make sure that we hang on to that?
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.880]   Because now you have people who weren't thinking about Final Cut, I mean, we're still using
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.200]   Final Cut, weren't thinking about Premiere, now thinking, "Well, maybe I should," you
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   know, not.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.400]   Well, I think that transition started though some years ago with it.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   It did.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   It did.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   But I mean, it's not just for that.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.520]   It's for a lot of other pro apps that are Mac only.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   So I think it was.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.480]   Now, all we have right now is IDC estimates.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:37.920]   But they estimate that the MacBook Pros did slow the Mac freefall globally, although
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.520]   quoting PC World here, they haven't provided the significant boost the company was looking
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   for.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   But this was earlier this month.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.440]   We'll get Mac sales broken out later today, right?
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.520]   Yeah, they don't usually break out which particular Mac's contributor towards it.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.880]   It's Matt, we know from previous years that it's massively shifted towards MacBook sales.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.080]   One of the problems Apple is having is that computer industry trends are saying, and there
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.040]   absolutely are people like Alex who need super powerful machines, but the trends are saying
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.160]   that the same thing that's happened to mobile is happening to computers, that people in
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.680]   general like faster, lighter computers.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.800]   And some people will call this the MacBook Pro Air.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.000]   And some people call it the MacBook Air Pro.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.360]   And both of those have very different connotations.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   But what's happening also is that we're really hitting a wall when you look at what Intel
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.880]   has done over previous generations, it was really generation after generation improvement.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.720]   And these are on Skylake and because the KBLake versions, those chips weren't ready yet.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.480]   But even now that the KBLake chips are coming out, they're not a significant improvement
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.600]   in terms of what people who want brute horsepower really want.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.640]   So some companies like Razer are going for more desktop like computers wrapped up as laptops.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.520]   But that's sort of bucking the energy and power trend that we're getting in laptops.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.920]   And ironically, the iMac and the Surface Studio are more laptops wrapped up as desktop computers.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.320]   It's almost like a wacky world inversion.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.800]   But it's not clear to me that we have that growth to make super powerful, super light,
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.200]   super portable computers for the next couple of years, especially not now that we have
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.840]   to deal with Canon Lake before we even get to, sorry, coffee lake and before we even get
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840]   to Canon Lake.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.360]   Well, Andy, you were compelled to buy a MacBook late last year, even though you knew the
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.400]   new ones are coming out because you spilled something into a little zero into the keyboard.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.040]   But I bet you you don't feel like you're...
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:24.000]   No, I really think that the speed of processors these days far exceeds most people's needs
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   for computing.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.760]   And I'm even including people who are doing video editing, people who are building code.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.800]   I know a lot of people who are professional coders who are even using MacBook Airs because
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.840]   it's perfectly fine.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.880]   I think that the swing now is going to be towards form factors and physical convenience, which
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.000]   is why we see devices like this where people are...
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Right.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It's pointing at the Surface Studio.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Inking the Surface Studio.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.320]   And also things like what ports around this, what's...
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.880]   How can we make this lighter?
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.520]   Do I want a machine that doesn't even really require a good keyboard because I don't really
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.720]   use it that much?
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.640]   This is why it continues to be disappointing that Apple is not really paying so much attention
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   to the Macs.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.080]   It's very true that Intel has sort of screwed up their timetable, but that doesn't mean
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.720]   that they can't find a way to...
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.760]   Let's design a desktop Mac that has...
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   They can still upgrade all the Thunderbolt ports to 3.0.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.960]   They can still design new form factors that are more in tune with what people are out
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.040]   there shopping for.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.120]   So there's still a lot of movement.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.600]   I think that it's no longer about how fast this process is.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   It really is.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.520]   It can come down to things like...
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.000]   Do you have four ports on this?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.640]   Did you put two on one side and two on the other or did you put four on the same side?
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.400]   Just simple things like that.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.080]   Alex, you said that people are going to the Razer?
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   Which Razer are the...
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.840]   This is the new Razer Blade Pro, which has the GTX 1080 in it.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840]   But it has a strange form factor.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.040]   There's a drag pad on the side.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   There's definitely one without that.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   The other thing they're doing, Razer is doing...
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.200]   And it's able to encode.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.120]   It's one with three screens.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.720]   Yeah, but that one.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Those got stolen from the...
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   They're stolen from the other side.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   So there aren't any.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.120]   Because I have to say, when I saw that, I was like, "I want that."
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   Yeah, but...
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   You know, like I was like, "I was like, "Red."
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   This is so exciting.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   But wasn't that great?
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.600]   Those aren't even machines that they have announced as making.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.240]   They just said, "Oh my gosh."
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.800]   We want to see what this looks like.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.720]   And now we're also going to put it out at CES.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.120]   A, yes, to get some press, but also let's see how people react to this.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.160]   It's called Project Valery, but it isn't...
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.120]   And now that they've bought an X-bit, they're going to have an Android phone with three screens
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   as might as you could pull those.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.480]   Which is an Android device.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.000]   Kind of an nice Android device.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.160]   Jason Hall loved his.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160]   Who is it?
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   Ron Richards has a...
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.640]   Wait until they get it with neon.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.840]   These are gaming machines though, Alex, but you're saying that the same exact kind of...
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.560]   Oh, they're gaming machines.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.120]   But the thing is, is that they're gaming machines, but they're also financial machines.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   They're also...
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.120]   Yeah, I love this screen.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.560]   If you're a Maya user or a Photoshop user, you know, having multiple screens, you know,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.080]   a lot of people are using duet or other things like that to get their second screen.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   I was...
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.760]   This is by the way, three 4K screens.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   So this is not even...
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   It is.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   It's really...
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   It's just all kinds of...
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   It's just all kinds of...
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.760]   Easy here.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760]   All kinds of greatness.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.040]   All the computers that created the first version of Toy Story are probably less powerful
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.200]   combined than just the processing required to track a mouse pointer across three 4K screens.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   I think...
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.280]   I'm thinking though that the one that you can buy that is closest to what a hardcore
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.720]   designer is going to want is the Razer Blade Pro.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   Let me just...
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   I'm curious.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.600]   Shall we price...
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   So why don't you...
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   Why don't you get...
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.640]   You're on an Apple store.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640]   Lisa's freaking out somewhere.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.440]   No, I'm not going to buy it.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.080]   Andy, Andy, grab his hand before he clicks the buy it now.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.800]   She's just canceling it.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.160]   These are expensive.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:58.560]   So Ultra HD screen with a 512 gig SSD is $3,700 for this.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.760]   And this is not the three screen one.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.480]   This is a single screen one.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   It's running an i7.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.880]   It's a 1080 which you can't even get on Apple.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.880]   Right.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.640]   This is 2.9, 512.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   I'm at 3000.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   Okay.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   But oh, I've got...
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   So this is Apple for Radeon which gets me to 3.3, 3000.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.640]   But the Radeon is not...
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.360]   Not nearly as good as the G4 1080.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.840]   Not even close.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.800]   Is this the desktop 1080?
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.000]   No, it must be a mobile 1080.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's a mobile 1080.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I don't think it's a 1080 either.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.600]   I think it's a 1080 or a 1060.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.640]   One has a 1060 at the super thin one and I think this one is actually a 1080, believe
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   it or not.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   Anyway...
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   But the idea is that this configurator you can basically build whatever you want.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640]   Right.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.280]   And that's only one laptop on a big constellation of laptop.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.640]   But you've got to run Windows.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   Well, and I still think that...
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640]   It's kind of a negative.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   It'll never happen.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.360]   But there is this point where you feel like at the point where Apple is ready to jettison
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.960]   the jettison there, the hardware business, I mean the hardware computer business and
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.400]   just stick with iOS and so on and so forth.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.960]   When those two have merged, it just still feels like they could burn the entire industry
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.240]   to the ground by just saying, "And now we will create some kind of licensing for the
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   OSX.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   Like we're not going to keep on...
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   You keep dreaming.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.240]   You keep dreaming.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.320]   I think what would be awesome if they just simply allowed it to be virtualized.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.640]   If they made it really, really easy to say, "No, we're not going to port it to anything
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.080]   else but we don't care if you want to keep them actually..."
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   Actually, that would be huge.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.560]   If you want to keep a Mac mini running on your network and then be able to use it on whatever
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.560]   platform you want.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560]   That would be huge.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.360]   That would be enough to keep a lot of people...
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   Sorry, not a lot.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.320]   Some people let's say on Mac that might be considering another platform.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   So these...
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.240]   I put a terabyte in.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   Why not?
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   $50,000, which is very much Apple pricing.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.880]   It is a 1080.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.360]   Looks like the desktop part GTX 1080, not M, but 1080.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.240]   The people buying this are not nearly as cost sensitive.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.240]   Right.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   It's got a 3840 by 2160 display.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   So it's Apple prices.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   It's not like you're going to save money on it, but you have the choice of...
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240]   You can get what you want.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   You can get what you want.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   You can get what you want.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   You can really think that that trackpad is weird.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   It's where the number pad would be.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   Yeah, it's weird to...
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.840]   For gamers, I understand, especially right-handed gamers.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.240]   You really want to put a trackpad off of the deck.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   You really want to put it exactly where you want it to go.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   Yeah, it's a laptop.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   But if you don't want this laptop, you don't have to buy it.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.640]   I mean, really, that's what Apple faces is this diverse ecosystem on the window side that
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   just, you know...
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   But that's Apple.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   It's always been that way.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   There's one Apple.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   It's all there is, right?
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.640]   And Apple was...
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   Steve, when it came back, was smart.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.040]   I think very smart to say, let's get...
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.840]   We get way too many model-ness.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.760]   They don't believe in all the little sister boards that Dell would let you add on for your
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   modular computing.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   Right.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.760]   And if I'm disappointed sometimes by this approach, at least I appreciate that it allows them
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.760]   to do things that...
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.760]   Focus.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   Exactly.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.280]   Not just that, but simply to say that we don't want to be bogged down supporting 10 years
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.560]   worth of hardware, 10 years worth of operating systems.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.720]   I've always said that the only definition of true power is the ability to determine your
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   own destiny, whether you're a car company, whether you're a software company, whether
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.040]   you're an individual.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.080]   And this is the power that Apple has to simply decide that we are not going to cut people
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.960]   off from the Mac, but we have decided that we want to suddenly make Macs that are on
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.840]   the same desktop, that on the same physical desk as somebody's iPad, as somebody's phone,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.600]   as opposed to the room where someone takes their iPad, puts it in the bag, puts it away,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.040]   because they've got this big, huge, screaming, forbin project style computer that's one
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.240]   in the Macintosh operating system.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.880]   Getting back to the quarterly results again, in 130 we'll get the paper and then two, the
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:48.440]   panelists call Pacific Times, so that's about an hour and a half, hour 45 from right now.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.560]   One of the things I'll be looking at is services.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:19:01.320]   That's really was a big growth bright spot, last quarter, $24 billion in fiscal 2016.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.640]   The apples, believe it or not, second largest segment behind the iPhone, that's how important
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640]   services are.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   And that includes Apple Pay, Apple Music.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.480]   And it feels like something that just kind of snuck up on you.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.560]   It wasn't something that was obvious.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.280]   But I do remember Tim Cook even a couple of years ago saying watch services, that's
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.680]   we see that maybe it was-
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.960]   Be quiet that narrative.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.400]   Post iPhone, they tried that narrative to see if Wall Street would bite.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.960]   Well, I don't know how I helped the stock price, but it must have done all right.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.760]   But I think it's clearly helping the bottom line.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:38.240]   It's also a hell of a growth spot for them because remember that the Mac is now 8.1%
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.040]   of the desktop market.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.960]   So when you sell services like movies, television, radio, that's Apple's first ability to sell
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.120]   to the entire world to get access to everybody's wallet instead of just 8% of people's wallets.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.840]   So I don't know what the analysts are expecting for services, but that is absolutely something
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   to watch.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.400]   It was average $6 billion a quarter last year.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.360]   It's unclear it's going to maintain the same growth because the previous growth was really,
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.840]   really high as it began to break it out.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   So they're probably-
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   They're probably going to have that massive-
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   Yes.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.920]   Massive holiday season powered mostly by Pokemon GO.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   Mario.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   Mario, Mario.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.520]   Have stores an increasing bright spot.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   A lot of apps.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.800]   In fact, I didn't Nintendo say they had- Nintendo's results were- came out yesterday and they had
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:31.600]   excellent quarter even though they had the smallest fraction of Pokemon GO.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.360]   But it was enough to give them a significant improvement in their results.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.240]   They were expecting double digit conversion on to Mario Runner.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.840]   I don't know if that was reasonable to expect that.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.360]   They got around 5% conversion.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.760]   High unlock rate.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.960]   They are delaying according to this story animal crossing for the iPhone.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   Oh.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.680]   They did make an easy mode for Super Mario Run.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   Did they?
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   They didn't go back to it.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   I know.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.640]   I paid the 10 bucks, but it's too hard for me.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.440]   I got too far along and now it's-
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:09.920]   According to some analytics, Apple Pay usage grew 50% last year.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.760]   So that may be another source of some really big numbers.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.120]   Once again, not everybody can afford an iPhone, but everybody uses money.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:24.720]   So if you can basically find a way to get access to every time someone buys a bagel,
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.800]   you're setting yourself for a very happy view.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.200]   But to put it in perspective, if you take all the retailers in aggregate, Apple Pay
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.080]   transactions are less than 1% of total transactions.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.200]   I say that's just a big opportunity for growth a lot.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   That's true.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.440]   Because there's so few people that are using their phone as a percentage.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.560]   And even I find that even when I go to Starbucks or Whole Foods, a lot of times I'm using cards,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.800]   the big problem I have with Apple Pay is that I accidentally charge the wrong card.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.440]   It's just too easy because I have a lot of different cards I'm charging for different
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.440]   things.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.400]   So I decided that I have to do it only for when I'm doing business or only make that
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   one the primary.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.760]   I think that that difficulty.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.920]   And then also when retailers are then asking you for your signature or asking for a pin,
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   you're kind of like, "Really?"
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.920]   You know, like that's the...
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.840]   I thought I didn't have to do that.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   But you do.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   If you argue with them...
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.520]   I've been told if you argue with them a little bit, it actually gets...
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.240]   I am not going to argue with some corporate whole food.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   After they've made your coffee with lid on it, not before.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   Apple says, "35..."
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   I made a...
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.520]   It puts a mixture froth in this one for you, sir.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.400]   Apple says, "35% of US retailers have Apple Pay."
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   So it isn't...
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   There is...
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   So there's two ways to look at it.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.880]   Oh, only 35 cents or a lot of growth potential.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   The other thing is...
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   Poorly and locates.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   Everybody is using tab to pay...
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.160]   The biblical version of everybody, meaning that ordinary people are using it.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.240]   I don't see a lot of people doing that.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   Do you?
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.840]   Well, because not a lot of people have one of these.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.280]   But I do see people...
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.600]   I mean, I still see cards.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   I mean, we're...
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.600]   Chipps are finally happening.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   I see a lot of people kind of...
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.240]   You guys have seen this or not, though.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.960]   But I mean, like, the first few times I was using tab to pay, especially with my watch,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.440]   I get these freaked out exp...
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Whoa, wow, how did that...
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   Not even a lot of...
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   And now...
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.920]   A couple of times I've done it now, the person is like sort of lifted up their own wrists
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   and go, "Hi, hi!"
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.480]   We all do that.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   Okay, one of us...
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.880]   What do you think the top retailers are in the US for Apple Pay?
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.720]   Whole Foods got to be one, right?
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   Mmm, but...
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   Even bigger than Apple stores.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Yeah, Apple stores.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   The main read is number one.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   Well, that's right.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   I'm here.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   I can actually cheat when you ask these questions.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   Oh, stop looking!
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   I'll make it big for you, Andy.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   I'm loving this.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   I know.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.600]   I'm totally spoiled.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   Look at this, too.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   I could do this.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   1.8 and 1.7 percent with...
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.280]   I put a box, so I'll go back to the left and then the right box, I'll go through the
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   middle.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280]   Yeah, I do.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   I feel like an NFL analyst.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   So the...
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.720]   Although interesting, most mobile apps and websites actually have higher usage, Hotel Tonight,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.040]   4 percent, followed by Caviar Postmates and DoorDash.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   Those are all food delivery.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   I do most things.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   I didn't realize it.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   It makes sense with food delivery, I guess.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   Yes.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   I...
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.880]   It is the one thing that I've thought about getting the new Mac for specifically with the...
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   Love the touch ID.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   The touch ID, yeah.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.960]   Because when you start using Apple Pay, you really realize how insecure your card is.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   And you kind of just want...
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   I really just like to...
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   I know, I know.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   I really just want to use biometrics.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.280]   Like, I don't really want to use...
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.680]   I don't want to use passwords anymore.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.520]   I don't want to use credit cards anymore.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   I just want to have it be preferably...
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   Believe it.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   Believe it.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.760]   My face and my finger would be great.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.680]   Well, even if it's not a security thing, it really is just a convenience thing.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   When I was using the...
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:40.320]   I switched back to iPhone and the Apple Watch so I could test out the new iPhone last year.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.480]   So entire summer, most of the fall.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.880]   And that's the one thing I missed when I went back to Android is the ability to not even
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.120]   take my phone out of my pocket and just tap... move my watch to just make something happen.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.640]   There's going to be an Android Wear 2.0 is coming out next week.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.760]   And either I'm perfectly happy with this watch.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.240]   It's a perfectly good watch.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.720]   The new watch is going to have NFC.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.680]   And that's the reason why I'm going to take off this perfectly good one.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.440]   But there is one thing that worries me about Touch ID on the MacBook that I really hadn't
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.080]   considered until recently is just the idea that...
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:20.160]   It's the idea that if my MacBook is protected by a passcode, you cannot coerce me to give
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.240]   up the passcode without a court order.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.440]   Whereas if I can unlock a laptop with just a fingerprint, I'm not sure that I would
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.800]   like to go through a border control.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.440]   Now there's some sort of directive that says that anybody who came in from Belgium were
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.680]   interested in terrorist activity in Belgium, make them unlock it.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   We want to look at their lab.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   It looks like that's starting to happen.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.720]   Sometimes this is the sort of thing that unfortunately is starting to worry about.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.200]   Whereas with fingerprints, they can actually demand that you do that because it doesn't
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.400]   violate your Fifth Amendment rights, but a passcode does.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.280]   Although there's debate on that too now, it's not that clear.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.320]   But at least I can make that argument at the border without knowing I'm going to be slammed
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.760]   into a wall and clapped into irons.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.200]   Whereas if I wouldn't try it these days, I'll be honest with you.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   I don't see that.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.000]   I would think it's a little risky.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I still think I still think people powering down airports or just turning off.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Fortunately, I'm a white guy.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.280]   I've got the best protection whatsoever against that kind of stuff.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.640]   I still think that Apple should put somewhere in their kill code.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.480]   So if we were talking about security, type this code in.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.880]   No way they're going to do that now.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   It's too provocative.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.560]   At this point, I don't think so.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   I think that that people would want it.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.320]   They would have to have done that before January 20th.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   How do you pronounce it?
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   Coquitlem?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   Coquitlem?
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   Coquitlem?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.480]   Did you see these shimmers that were used in Canada?
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   I'm asking you.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.080]   You don't know how to pronounce it, Renee?
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   Coquitlem?
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   It's in BC.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   No, I don't.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   Yeah, it's North of Vancouver.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   Coquitlem?
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   Coquitlem.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   Coquitlem, eight.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.880]   Look at these little, they call them shimmers or shimmers.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.840]   They're so tiny you can actually and they're conveniently marked note with arrows to show
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   you.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.120]   Which way to put that in?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:10.720]   What they do is they attach that to a card and then in using the ATM or the credit card
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:19.480]   reader, the card leaves that behind and then some days or weeks later they come back and
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.600]   using a different card they retrieve it and it's got every card that was read over that
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.760]   period of time.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.640]   The only reason it was discovered by this Coquitlem retailer is because they did routine
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.920]   checks looking for skimmers and stuff and one of their cars felt sticky.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.880]   It couldn't quite, a normal car couldn't get it out and so they said, "Well, let's take
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.680]   this apart" and they found this thing.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.760]   People don't realize that when you're thinking about people who are trying to scam credit
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:55.920]   card numbers and ATM numbers, you're not talking about punk kids and little street hoods.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.280]   We're talking about a very sophisticated industry that has their own Johnny Ive.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   They have their own R&D.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.000]   I'm serious that they have their own fabric.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   They must.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.120]   They've got that guy from Oceans 12 or 13 or whatever.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.320]   We've decided to make sure that you insert your shimmer perfectly.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.520]   We've added these two handy arrows.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.960]   Because the person actually putting it into the ATM may actually be something.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   And then you imagine the top hood.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   We don't care that you made this out of an orange ceramic.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.600]   How much money can we make from it?
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   Quite a bit.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.360]   We still have your dog tied up.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.480]   The most skimmer we've ever made.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.840]   I was told a long time ago, because we've had a pin and chip and things like that in
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.960]   Canada for a long time and they were telling us a decade ago that it's good practice to
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   put your code in wrong the first time because they don't know that it's wrong.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   Oh.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.480]   And if you get an error, then it means that you're actually talking to the other computer.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.880]   You put it in and go, "No, that's not the correct passcode."
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.240]   But if it doesn't say anything, then wait a minute, this is not a correct terminal.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.960]   But that is, and I think that when you see stories like this, it really kind of, when
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.680]   I saw this earlier, last week, I said, "Oh, I'm going to use TAP to pay more," because
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.080]   that is not even giving a credit card number.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.120]   Even if they had some sort of way of getting it, they wouldn't get anything of it.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.720]   That's why I want all the retailers to move to something where you're doing TAP.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.080]   No, no, no, but ATMs too, I was pretty excited this weekend to use my San Francisco.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.720]   He's my first Apple Pay/Google for the NXT.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   Is that Bank of America?
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   That's new.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   So you basically just wave your phone in front of it.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.400]   And if you've already set it up, you've got your withdrawal and you've never made
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   any sort of contact whatsoever.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   Check in at the gym now with my Apple Watch.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   That's kind of cool.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.800]   Anyway, just a reminder, an hour and a half out from Apple's earnings for the quarter,
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.960]   the big quarter.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.880]   It's their fiscal Q1, right?
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   Q1, but it's a holiday quarter.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   And we'll be hearing, "Business Tim."
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.880]   Very soon.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   Business Tim?
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   Ah, this is Tim.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   Isn't it?
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.840]   He's the only one with that boy is every time.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.560]   My trainer went to Auburn, and thanks to Tim Cook, I knew that I should tell him War
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   Eagle.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.720]   And he said, "War Damn Eagle."
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.280]   I did it right.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.520]   Sometimes I accidentally say roll tight, and that's not good.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.280]   Give me 20, la port.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.560]   Our show today brought to you by, we're so glad to have you guys at Studio.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   So nice to see you.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.080]   Andy Inako in Studio from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.920]   Alex Lindsey from Pixelcorps, and poor old Renee out in left field.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   I'm War.com.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   He's so cool.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   He's the beast.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   He's drawn travolti.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.560]   He's the boy in the plastic bubble.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.440]   I'm holding down the East Coast for Andy, so let's hear when he comes back.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.920]   Somebody's got to keep it in place.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.400]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.040]   This is a product created by the best mortgage lender in the country.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.400]   Now you don't have to take my word for it.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.000]   Go to quickandlones.com/macbreak.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.400]   Look at all those customer satisfaction awards year after year.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:55.520]   They are not only a great lender, but they've created a product designed for us, for geeks.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.760]   It's called Rocket Mortgage, and it takes the mortgage approval process out of the 18th
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.680]   century and right fast into the 21st century because it's completely online.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.200]   Hallelujah.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   Completely.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Did I say that?
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.680]   Let me say it again.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.280]   Completely online.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.000]   You can even do it from your couch and your phone.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.720]   You can submit the paperwork they need, your pay stubs or your bank statements with a touch
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.040]   of a finger.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.640]   They even have, because now computers, you can customize your loan.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.200]   They have sliders for rate and time frame and all that.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.680]   So you can get exactly the loan you want and they turn it around really fast in minutes.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   So here's the deal.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:40.600]   If it's time to buy a new house or time to refi, and by the way, I know they...
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   I sound like one of those radio ads, but Fed has indicated interest rates are going to
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   be going up.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.600]   So it might be a good time to do it now.

[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.320]   Let's see, what else is going down?
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.720]   So many in the chat room when we were beginning said, "Okay, we're going to see a new Mac Pro.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   When we're going to see the new Mac Pro, is it an added Mac Pro here?"
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.920]   He said, "I had to ask."
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   Not yet, right?
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.560]   Do you think they'll call in?
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560]   Call in, ask.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   Hey, Tim, new Mac Pro?
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.400]   What do you think?
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.880]   March would be a reasonable time.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   Yeah?
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.840]   This is going to be interesting because, well, iPads, it's unclear whether they're going
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.640]   to ship on time.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.440]   Because, again, they're going for advanced technology and full screen.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   All that stuff is difficult.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   I'm yield-rate.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.680]   So if they don't have iPads ready, do they still do an event for Macs?
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.280]   Are the Macs big enough differences that it'll warn an event?
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.760]   Is campus too ready?
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.280]   Is AC2 ready to actually have the media?
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.480]   Do they have to once again wind up town hall?
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.200]   I mean, there's a lot of moving parts.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.760]   A number of people were mentioning, we talked about it yesterday on iOS today, that Apple
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:18.160]   has removed the online activation lock checker.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:26.760]   You used to be able to enter your IMEI number and get a check your activation lock status.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.840]   And they've removed that.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.920]   And my speculation yesterday was, "Well, that must have been because it gave bad guys
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.680]   some sort of information."
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   Yes.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.040]   Well, that's confirmed, right?
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   Yes.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.520]   No one has confirmed it, but that is as far as I know the reason.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:49.880]   It was, according to Mac rumors, a vital part of a bypass hack used to unlock devices
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.560]   bricked by activation lock.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.360]   And there's a video on YouTube demonstrating it.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.840]   What you do, I'll turn off the sound.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   We don't have to listen to that.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   But what you do is you change one or two characters of an invalid serial number and
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.760]   then generate a valid serial number using that tool.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   What?
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.360]   Use that to check to make sure this here number appears.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   That's a lot of it.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   That's the thing about hackers.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   They're like squirrels.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.040]   They got a car and iron gun to get in your attic no matter what you do.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.160]   This is why we can't have nice internet tools.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.760]   You know, we brought back drawing and cordoning.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   Cut this back.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   Say it.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.560]   Yeah, come on, President Trump.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.280]   We need an executive order for this.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   I think so.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   It's immigration stuff that I'm not that excited about.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.360]   But actually, it just gets hackers and all the lammers.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   I'm just saying.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.160]   Supposedly today, this is kind of a sidebar.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.480]   The president is going to do a cyber security analysis.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.440]   Cyber Leo, the cyber.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   Oh, good.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   Cyber.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.160]   I'm sure it's going to be as good for the country and well thought out as well.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.000]   Well, that's actually why I want to pay attention to it.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.360]   So if that comes if that comes across the wire as if we had a wire, if that comes across
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.960]   the wire, I will rip it and I will.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.360]   Everyone has to use windows, most secure.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.600]   Sorry, the original blackberries, most secure operating system.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   The only one you're allowed to use.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   You don't use it.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   You're a loser.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   And sorry, a galaxy S3.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.680]   Everyone's using galaxy S3s.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.840]   Activation lock is by the way.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.320]   That's the kill the kill switches sometimes that was referred to.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.680]   It started in iOS seven and it has made at least everything I've seen says, it's made
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.200]   a huge difference in the number of stolen iPhones, right?
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.240]   Thebes just said, yeah, I'm not going to steal an iPhone.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   I can't do anything.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.480]   Now they're being stolen for parts as opposed to the country resale.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.920]   Not been used.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.200]   My guess is that there'll be an API based way to check this going forward, but you'll
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.160]   have to be a retailer or reseller of some merit.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.560]   So just tell me, how did they, this website get used?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.800]   So you would enter your IMEI number and then it would tell you.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.560]   Well, let's say you were selling me a Craig's list or an eBay listing, an iPhone or I wanted
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.080]   to check and make sure it was installing because I didn't want to buy it and just get a brick.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.000]   So you would give me the number, I would go, I type, but it's okay, that's an unlocked
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.200]   iPhone and I don't have to worry about activation lock on that and then I'd make the purchase
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.880]   with you.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.240]   And again, that was being abused.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.560]   People were using it to check and either generate fake serial numbers or just find out.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.200]   Could you unlock, you couldn't unlock a phone at that website though?
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.480]   No, no, you can do the activation.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.600]   So if I, if you stole my iPhone and this is true of the watch true or two, right or not,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.400]   if you stole my watch or my iPhone and then tried to do a reset, it would ask you for
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.600]   your password.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.680]   And if you don't know it, you can't reset it and so you can't use it.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.680]   Is that?
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.880]   Yeah, depending on the sequence, either you can't reset it or you can't restore it.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.760]   So if you did reset it, but then it would say before you restore it, give me your password.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.360]   How do you get around that?
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.360]   You don't.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.920]   I mean, I, I, some people have tried swapping parts, but you know, they have a hardware
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.520]   that kills which if you put in a different type of idea or something, you can.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.960]   So what I've told, told people, and I hope this is accurate is save your sales receipt.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.120]   Because if you go to an Apple store and can prove you own it, you say, look, see, here's
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   the device.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.720]   Here's the IEMI number on a, an on sales receipt, then they can bring it in the bag and do something
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   and then reset it.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   Right?
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   Apple can unlock it.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.040]   We get every day on every day, but many, many times a week we get people saying I accidentally
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:26.240]   forgot and can you guys help me please figure out because it's totally my device, but I
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   just forgot.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.800]   Or you can, you can reset the device.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:35.560]   But then it asks you before you do anything with it for your, yeah, I, I, but like, but
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.880]   like my, I've done it a couple of times for my kids where they, you know, yeah, Michael
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.280]   forgot his, Michael created a new, uh, law code and then promptly forgot it.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   Then you reset it.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.240]   So when you reset it and that's all you have to do do a hard hard, hard, hard code.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.120]   Oh, but it will ask you for my iCloud, your iCloud password because it's a family account
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.960]   and because I put it inside that family account that we're able to reset their, their iPad.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.480]   So that's the key and I've done it.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.560]   I'm getting really good at it.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.040]   So mom and dad, because kids will do that.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.080]   What happens is, is, is my son, uh, is very good.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.720]   He's gotten a near photograph.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.720]   Oh, he's, he's nine.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.800]   Oh, he's getting old and now he's trouble.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.320]   He sees you type your code in at like, out of the corner of his eye, he'll immediately
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   remember the whole thing.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.040]   And so then he gets into my, my daughter's iPad and then she changes it and then she
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   forgets it.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   That's, that's the, that's the pattern.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   And then I, and then I reset it.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.880]   But to be fair, I learned how to pick locks when dad put a lock on the lock on his, on
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   his, on his kids.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   No, absolutely.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.680]   You were one of those kids.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.640]   So it's, it's an internal thing.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.120]   I learned how to pick locks because my grandfather had a safe.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   That was cool.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   And what was it?
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   That's safe diamonds.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   No.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   Mm hmm.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.480]   I didn't take any and not, not there anymore.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.680]   It's kind of hard to fence them.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.000]   I think you got the connections and I never got, I will say I never got into that.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.160]   I just learned, but I learned a lot about locks trying to.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.000]   Oh, we, we're at least eight percent worry that as soon as you heard that click on the
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.760]   door swing, you open that I'm going to find a passport with my grandfather's picture in
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.960]   it, but a totally different name, a go bag, a gun with two different.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   That's what I'm expecting.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:18.160]   Like, when I was in Pennsylvania, I finally got to open it once because I had never seen
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.240]   the inside of it.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.800]   I heard stories and then it turned out to be, you know, some family silver and a scrapbook
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.720]   boring, famously, what are the odds that the New England Patriots will beat the Atlanta
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.640]   Falcons?
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.760]   The odds favor the Patriots over the Falcons by three points.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   Series smart.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.160]   So they've added Super Bowl commands to Syria.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.800]   Patriots over the top of the Patriots winning the Super Bowl next week.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.360]   Does Android now you doing Android?
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.200]   It's thinking.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   Oh, thinking.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.480]   This one is just a semi giving, getting links to links to searches.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.680]   They got out ahead of Walmart.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   We're going this one.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   Didn't want any more bad press.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:08.640]   So apparently there are a whole bunch of Super Bowl commands and public transit directions.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:15.480]   If you're going to the Super Bowl for Houston, which I like, this serves a small number
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.520]   of Apple iPhone users, right?
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.840]   Like 60,000 or 100,000.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.280]   But that's the whole point of these voice assistants.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.920]   It's not just giving you that one feature.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:29.240]   It's also helping to get you to trust that if I've got a question, my first go to is going
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.600]   to be to ask a question of my phone.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.960]   You know, we were talking about the other day.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   That is the key.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   Trust.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.640]   Because what happens is you get three dumb answers in a row and you go, I'm not asking
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   that ever again.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.120]   I'm not going to ever use that again.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.280]   So you have to develop that.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.280]   Oh, I understand.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.080]   I know Siri will do this and then you're more likely to use it.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.640]   Well, and it's not, I think there are issues right now with Siri where it's not specific
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   enough.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   So I asked Siri to play, I hadn't tried to use music on my iPhone 7.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.920]   And so I asked Siri to play some song and she goes, "Uh oh.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.560]   You don't have, you know, you're not on Wi-Fi and you don't have your cell enabled."
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.200]   Now, I didn't know what that meant.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.840]   Like, I didn't know that it meant for music because then I go to the phone and I check
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.240]   it and I'm like, no, the phone's working fine.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.680]   And then I took me a couple of times before I actually went and I'm driving.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.000]   I wonder how Siri, how sophisticated it is.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.240]   What is the over under for the Super Bowl?
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.880]   Man, I wonder how sophisticated.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.680]   No wonder for the Patriots, Falcon's game is 58.5.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   Wow.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   It knows the over under.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   So it's, so it's...
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   What are some other propositions?
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   They've got its sequential as well.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   Like you can ask when it is and then ask what channel it's on and it knows that you're
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   in the Super Bowl.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   When is the Super Bowl?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.440]   The Super Bowl 51's date is February 5th, 2017.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.000]   That was a tie.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.520]   But you didn't get the time.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.240]   What channel is it on?
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   The Patriots face the Falcons in the Super Bowl on Sunday at 3.30 p.m.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.000]   That's interesting.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.320]   What channel is the Super Bowl on?
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.280]   No, see, I didn't say the Super Bowl.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   That's the point.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   What did you say?
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.600]   I said, as Renee was saying, it's got context.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.520]   So first I asked when it was a Super Bowl.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.320]   Then I said, what channel is it on?
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.400]   Now Google will do that, by the way.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.480]   Who's playing in the Super Bowl?
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:21.400]   Atlanta, Falcon's will take on New England Patriots on Sunday at 3.30 p.m.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.760]   Who's favored to win?
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   The Raptors.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.920]   Who's favored to win?
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.420]   Oh.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.660]   You got picked up the last...
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.520]   I'm sorry, you should never talk about somebody's talking to their phone.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.800]   That's part of the reason why none of this is going to ever take off, because people
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   talk.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   Or you don't want to talk like...
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.400]   And your kids, the kids are terrible, right?
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   Tell me this is true.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.000]   You'll start doing a series and the kids go, what are you doing there?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   They've actually gotten...
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.280]   It's funny, as they learn to shut up.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:53.000]   Because my kids spend so much time talking to Google Home, they worry when one of them
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.520]   goes over to talk to Google Home, the other one's get quiet because they're like, the
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.680]   other one gets quiet because they're like, don't mess up her thing.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:06.860]   That's very funny because, hey, Shlomo, find me budget military schools in both sides.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.660]   I haven't tried that one, but I will.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.900]   The Crockett one from 16 minutes.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:17.660]   So a little evidence that it is possible for a government to encourage Apple to bring manufacturing
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.820]   home.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.380]   The Indian government has pretty strict rules about what kinds of devices can be sold in
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   India.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:28.380]   And in general, they're trying to strongly encourage companies to manufacture devices
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.860]   in India if they want to sell them there.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:35.900]   It looks like Apple's close to making a deal to manufacture iPhones in India.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.260]   And the tit for tat is in order to open retail stores in the country.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.820]   And according to a government official, this story from 9 to 5 Mac, it's almost a done deal.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:49.940]   Actually, Wall Street Journal had that story meeting today between team of Apple executives
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.740]   and senior Indian government officials.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.260]   So we've heard kind of some drumbeat that Apple might be or Foxconn might be looking
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.500]   at manufacturing iPhones in the US as well because of President Trump.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   That would be interesting.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.420]   To me, it's like how far does it scale?
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.420]   Because Brazil did this earlier.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.620]   It results huge in the taxes.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.820]   And then this Canada and Germany.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:15.820]   And I feel like Belgium, 256 countries, 156 of them want their iPhones.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.220]   If it's a big market, and Brazil's a big market, India's a big market, obviously the
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.220]   US and China.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.620]   Then they have the market cloud to say, no, we want you to make it here.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:29.620]   It's a big market.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:34.620]   There's a good reason that Foxconn is building 60,000 robots a year.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.620]   Whether or well as the jobs in the long run is another question.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:44.620]   This idea that having the factory in your country makes a difference is quickly fading.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:49.620]   This whole concept that globalization is what's costing people jobs is becoming less and less
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:55.620]   than they're going to be.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.620]   And there is this issue of, is a trade war good for anybody.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   If you start putting big tariffs on items brought in from China, those tariffs end up being paid by you and me, not by you.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:17.620]   And I'm almost rapidly pro labor, but even I recognize that when it comes to forcing a company to manufacture a product a specific way or manufacturer specific products full stop, that tends to be really, really limited.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:32.620]   If California has an emissions law that applies to all cars sold there, if it makes sense for GM to make all cars that way or if it's efficient for them to make all cars that way, they'll just make all cars they sell everywhere that way.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:42.620]   However, if you force them to sell a certain amount of electric vehicles 20 years before they think it's practical, they will create a leasing program.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.620]   They will build 1500 to 1800 of them.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:52.620]   And then meanwhile, put more money into fighting this than actually building the stuff and they'll pull them off the road as soon as they have any opportunity to do so.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:46:00.620]   We should also mention as long as we're talking politics that Tim Cook did issue a statement in email.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:06.620]   It wasn't a public statement. It was an email to Apple employees about the immigration kerfuffle from Sunday night.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:13.620]   He said, "I've heard from many of you are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim majority countries.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.620]   I share your concerns. It's not a policy we support.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:23.620]   Although ironically, Apple is cutting off iOS apps from the app store that come from Iran."
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.620]   This is related to international law.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.620]   Well, yeah, this is sanctions.
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.620]   It has nothing new.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.620]   The Iran app is not immigrants.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   It's not immigrants.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.620]   It's because of sanctions.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.620]   Or actually, it's limitations in US national law.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.620]   Yeah, there are several. Some of them are encryption.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.620]   Some of them are based on general software.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.620]   I'm disappointed with Apple's response. That's a pretty weak sauce.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.620]   You think it's tepid?
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:54.620]   Almost all, while many companies responded, most of the responses were judicious.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:47:01.620]   Remember, I think Apple has a responsibility to its shareholders to not antagonize.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.620]   Meanwhile, Google is pledging $4 million.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.620]   Google won't strike on Monday.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.620]   Not just the "Oh my God, all the workers are on."
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.620]   It was a massive Google event saying everybody's upset.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:25.620]   Meanwhile, Lyft, the first time I came up here on Saturday to do the new screenstavors, I took a noobar up because that's the app that I've been using.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:33.620]   Then Lyft announced that we are donating $1 million over four years to the ACLU, and Uber app goes out for me.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:42.620]   Well, there was a backlash against Uber because at JFK, the taxi drivers in protest stopped picking up or...
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.620]   When on a one hour break.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.620]   ...in one hour.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:54.620]   And Uber probably inappropriately at the same time said, "We're not going to have a surge if you want to get to be fair."
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.620]   To be fair, I don't know if they have the ability to turn off, given all these are all independent people.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.620]   I think in every case, this is kind of capitalizing on something.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.620]   It's more for commercial value.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.620]   There was also a lot of bad sentiment towards Uber before this.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.620]   Well, there was a hashtag delete Uber.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.620]   I think it would have been taking advantage of the situation.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.620]   If they said that we were going to allow 2X, 3X, 4X, 8X surges.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:23.620]   My choice wasn't, oh, screw you, Uber, for what you did.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.620]   Which is pro Lyft.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.620]   It was a million dollars the ACLU done.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:31.620]   Also, I've been leaning towards getting off my butt and switching to Lyft.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.620]   Well, it helps because the Lyft app, I think, is now number three on the app store.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.620]   Exactly.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.620]   It's a lot.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.620]   I've been downloading Lyft.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.620]   I've been using Lyft a lot for a bright sharing to get around the city.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:48.620]   My very first Lyft pickup on Saturday was your first time using Lyft.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.620]   Is it because of the strike?
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.620]   I was like, "Well, no, we had a good conversation about it."
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   I also like that I can tip this person directly from the app and say, "Please, take five bucks.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.620]   It goes directly to this person because they were awesome."
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:07.620]   Yeah, I think that the whole thing is a little hyperbole with Uber.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:12.620]   Because I do think that they've done this before when there's been either some kind of action
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:16.620]   that will cause a surge and they've turned off surge pricing.
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.620]   It turns off actually to take care of everybody.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.620]   To take care of everybody.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.620]   And then they routinely tell everyone, "Hey, that's what we're doing, but it may slow down."
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:27.620]   For me, a lot of times, I want to see surge pricing because I've got six cases that I'm trying to get to,
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:34.620]   and it's raining, and I want surge pricing to make sure that I'm more important than the person with a family of three that can barely afford the airline ticket.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.620]   I just want to get on with it.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.620]   I just need a car.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:47.620]   For me, leaving Uber was about, or not leaving Uber, but adding Lyft to what I'm doing is mostly because Uber has this one little problem,
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:52.620]   which is that when a driver doesn't know where they're going to take you, and when they show up,
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:58.620]   when you live in San Rafael and you try to get picked up in San Francisco, they'll cancel on you, standing in front of you.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.620]   They'll just cancel--
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.620]   I don't like that.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.620]   They do.
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.620]   Well, that's zero stars.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.620]   Now, I'll tell you how I--
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.620]   Well, you can't.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:05.620]   You didn't have a--
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.620]   Right.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.620]   But you can email and say, here's what this person--
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:08.620]   No, I can't.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:16.620]   There's no mechanical thing in the app for me to complain specifically about someone canceling on me when I get another one right afterwards.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.620]   And so, like a 10 minutes later, I get-- because they consider it the same trip.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:27.620]   And so the only way that I-- the only way I do it in the city is I go, oh, totally get it.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.620]   Can you just take me eight blocks down?
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.620]   And then I get them to take me eight blocks down, and then I give them a one.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.620]   Right.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.620]   But that's what I call the shit.
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:35.620]   But to get--
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.620]   I know you know, just--
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.620]   But to get back at it.
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.620]   I mean, there's such a thing as antagonizing somebody unnecessarily.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.620]   But there's also such a thing as saying, no, we don't approve of this.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.620]   I want you to feel the pressure of this decision.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:58.620]   If you really think that this move that you did on Friday is really good, then you're going to have the strength and coverage to put up with all the crap that we're going to try to put on you.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:02.620]   You've got-- you've got 20, 30, 40-- I was so proud of the mayor of Boston because, you know,
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:07.620]   there was big Logan Airport had one of the big impromptu protests.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:13.620]   And so immediately the mayor of Boston comes down, the senator Warren comes down, and there's not like tear gas--
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.620]   people firing tear gas-- make-- keep the honest clear for people to go.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.620]   He picked up the bullhorn and said, by all means, stay, keep your protest going.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:26.620]   But how about we all meet tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Copley Square.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:31.620]   That's why there were tens of thousands of people because the mayor of the city of Boston was saying that, no,
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:35.620]   you are not only are you-- are you not going to be hassled, I'm encouraging you to come here.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:48.620]   So every single scrap of video like that says that if you do things that are-- that let's-- I'll be-- I'll be a little bit more broad than I'll say that a certain number of people think is an incredibly stupid thing.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.620]   We are not going to say, oh, well, you know, you're new and well.
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.620]   We don't want to take-- we're going to say screw you.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.620]   We debated this a little bit on Sundays.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.620]   Phil Libben was here from--
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.620]   Sorry, I'm so angry about it.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.620]   So I should just--
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:51:59.620]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.620]   And I understand and a lot of people are.
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:07.620]   But a CEO is in a different position than a mayor, an elected official.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:16.620]   And I think CEOs sometimes feel like they have a fiduciary responsibility not to damage their value, their company.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:22.620]   Remember, Tim Cook has $200 billion overseas and he's trying to repatriate that.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.620]   Okay, so--
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:24.620]   Also, we go to the--
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.620]   Just to go back to Uber--
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.620]   Uber-- to make lower-cost Macs.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.620]   They have the fiduciary responsibility to open the--
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.620]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.620]   The fiduciary responsibility is to their shareholders.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.620]   That's a U.M.A. that he has no responsibility to--
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.620]   They're fiduciary responsibility is to their shareholders.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   That's a U.M.A. that he has no responsibility to--
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.620]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.620]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.620]   They're fiduciary responsibility is to their shareholders.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   That's a U.M.A. that he has no responsibility to--
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.620]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.620]   They're fiduciary responsibility is to their shareholders.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.620]   That's a U.M.A. that he has no responsibility to--
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.620]   With the way that they've reacted to the past.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.620]   Yeah, I think this has been building up for a while.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.620]   And also, the last couple of times I've used Uber in the Bay Area,
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.620]   the actual drivers, because a lot of the drivers drive from multiple companies.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.620]   They've asked me to call them on Lyft next time.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.620]   They've even given me coupons to do it because they believe they're treated much more fairly by Lyft.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.620]   I think when you add all those together, this was sort of--
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.620]   Like, whatever-- like, people are arguing the timeline where they're--
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.620]   where their Uber really meant to do anything wrong or not,
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   or about whether serving on a council is wrong or not.
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.620]   But you just add all that together, and I think that tipped people over the end.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.620]   Yeah, I just thought it out.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   Travis Kalinek and this has long-term problematic behavior on Uber's part.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:29.620]   Oh, by the way, Uber is-- and Lyft, in the process basically,
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.620]   of bankrupting the taxi business.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:39.620]   This story today in Bloomberg, it looks like, according to Capital One,
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.620]   which apparently does a lot of lending to drivers to buy medallions.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   Medallions are very expensive.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.620]   They've been as high as $1 million.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   That's the right to drive a taxi in New York City.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.620]   As high as $1 million.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   That number's going way down, and Capital One is telling its investors,
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.620]   81% of its $690 million in taxi medallion loans are in risk of default.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:05.620]   81% and that, you have to think, is coming from competition, from a ride-sharing.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.620]   Oh, and absolutely is, but I don't think it's just that Uber and Lyft put them under.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.620]   What put them under were decades of poor service.
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   You know, like, that's true.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.620]   You know, like, it's just-- that's true.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.620]   Oh, gosh.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.620]   I remember the years before Lyft in Uber, and I can complain about Uber, like,
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.620]   canceling on me here and there.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   But it was just this.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.620]   You'd get in, you had to know exactly where you're going, exactly how you're going to get there.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.620]   I mean, you know, and make sure that the taxi driver doesn't take you for a loop.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.620]   Do we want the taxi industry to go away, though?
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.620]   I mean, is this good or bad?
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:42.620]   I want them to survive because they've earned my business.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:49.620]   By the last time that I tried to get to the airport via a taxi from my house,
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.620]   called over a week beforehand, locked it in, even budgeted in, well,
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.620]   what if they're going to be two hours late, budgeted that in,
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.620]   when they were two and a half hours late, called them, finally got through to them,
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.620]   and they didn't have my reservation, and they acted as though,
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.620]   "Oh, well, we don't have any cars available now."
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:05.620]   Sorry.
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:10.620]   Like, I'm closing on them, and I'm like, "Great, so I'm going to have to wake up a friend of mine at 7 a.m.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.620]   and have him drive me over."
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:15.620]   It's the same reason why I couldn't really feel bad
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.620]   when the independent bookstore in my town that when I was growing up
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.620]   would chase me out of the store because they're going to think I'm shoplifting,
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.620]   and besides, if I'd asked them for a book that they didn't have,
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.620]   they would say, "Oh, can you order it?"
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.620]   I just saw trouble.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.620]   I wasn't gleeful.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.620]   I wasn't gleeful.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:33.620]   Amazon's noubled her.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.620]   Amazon's noubled her.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.620]   But I'm like, "I don't care."
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:42.620]   It is telling, though, that when this action happened at JFK
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.620]   and the taxi drivers went on strike for an hour,
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:49.620]   it didn't get a lot of people taking taxis to support them.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.620]   It got a lot of people saying, "I don't like Uber. I'm going to take Lyft."
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.620]   It didn't redound to their benefit.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.620]   It benefited Lyft because of that one tweet.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.620]   If they had just kept their mouth shut and just turned it off,
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.620]   no one would have noticed.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.620]   It would have been like one of those just,
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:07.620]   "I'm all for empowered customers,
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.620]   but I'm not for bullying customers."
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.620]   I think sometimes people feel too empowered.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.620]   You see it on Twitter all the time, where they just,
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.620]   "Well, you were 10 minutes late. I'm never using you again."
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:23.620]   What I don't like is, "Hey, my soup wasn't to my liking.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.620]   I'm not going to tip my way."
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:28.620]   I'm like, "Well, you're not screwing the person who made your soup badly."
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.620]   We're going to take a break.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.620]   I want to ask Renee about your LG 5K monitor,
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.620]   because we're hearing some bad things about it.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.620]   Before I break the lead,
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.620]   two quick things on the responses.
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.620]   One is, Google's doing a phenomenal job.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.620]   They've been building.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.620]   They had an initial response,
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.620]   which was probably Apple caliber in terms of how strong it was,
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.620]   but they've rapidly ramped up since they had some kind of...
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.620]   Amazon has done that too.
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:49.620]   Jeff Bezos' recent response,
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.620]   way better than the initial Amazon response.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:55.620]   People put a toe in the water and see,
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.620]   "Well, what's going to happen if I say something?
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.620]   Am I going to get swamped by angry Trump supporters?"
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.620]   Also, Tim Cook was having dinner with these people in this whole house.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.620]   He was.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:08.620]   He had dinner Thursday with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.620]   And then Friday, I forget who it was.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:11.620]   And then Friday, Orrin Hatch.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.620]   He's making the rounds in Washington, D.C. right now.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.620]   I'm saying, if Apple lives in a world in which Google could do what it did,
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.620]   they have no response.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.620]   They have to have a really good response as to why I just said,
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.620]   "Well, in a private memo to my employees,
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.620]   I want to say that, gosh, we're disappointed by this,
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.620]   and gosh, we're worried about this."
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.620]   Did Cook make a public statement?
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.620]   Did he ever make a public statement?
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.620]   Yeah, not anything public yet.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.620]   Nothing yet.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:39.620]   Yeah, but it's sort of the week version of,
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:43.620]   "I'm going to send this email to everybody knowing that it's not going to remain secret,
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.620]   but I don't have to say that we made a public statement.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.620]   Where's your guts?"
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.620]   Well, Howard Schulz made a very strong CEO.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:56.620]   Starbucks made a very strong statement and said,
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.620]   "pledged to higher 10,000 refugees."
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.620]   That's a strong statement.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.620]   And in the face of that, there have been calls for boycotts from Trump supporters.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.620]   So he can take some real hits from that, right?
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.620]   This is where we've gone by simply saying,
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.620]   "We'll give people the benefit of the doubt, or we don't want to pull the tiger's tail."
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:19.620]   At some point, there's one way that we have influence as citizens.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:20.620]   One of them is to vote.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.620]   One of them is to support candidates and causes we like.
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:26.620]   But another one is to stand up in front of the public, in front of cameras,
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.620]   and say, "This is wrong.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.620]   This is not even a tiny bit, right?
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.620]   You've screwed up."
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:35.620]   And if we have a normal government employee here,
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.620]   they're going to not think, "Oh, look all these idiots.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.620]   Look all these people are being disloyal to their country."
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.620]   They're going to say, "Oh, we really didn't think that --"
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.620]   Maybe they're not going to do a 180 on this,
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:48.620]   but it will at least be a data point in how they evaluate the wisdom of this thing.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.620]   We have an obligation.
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:53.620]   You can see that it's almost -- so many days later,
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.620]   and I cannot stop being angry and talking about this.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:00.620]   If I'm just simply muttering at my walls, that's stupid.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.620]   That's selfish.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:06.620]   I feel the need to have an obligation, whatever we feel, to be involved.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   And I think the mistake people have made for too long is --
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.620]   and what was it?
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.620]   Two-thirds of the American people are half the American people to even vote.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.620]   We can't -- somebody's at my door.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.620]   You can't turn that off, shouldn't I?
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.620]   I think.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   A nice switch on the iPhone.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.620]   I wish I would use it.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:27.620]   But we can't -- that's really what I think everybody needs to stand up.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.620]   We need to have the discussion.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:32.620]   One of the worst thing that could happen is if everybody just says,
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.620]   "You know, politics doesn't matter.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:35.620]   Screw them.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.620]   I'm going to go about my day-to-day business and not worry about it."
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.620]   To be clear with the Starbucks thing,
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.620]   the backlash is unfortunate because their record,
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.620]   when it comes to veg-
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.620]   It's very good.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.620]   jobs of the U.S. is exemplary.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.620]   Not even good.
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:46.620]   It's outstanding.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.620]   And it's not an either-or for them.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.620]   People are upset that they're exemplary.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.620]   They had a program to hire veterans and military spouses.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.620]   I think one of the things, when you look at technology,
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.620]   and this is something that -- this is the reason that there was so much control in China.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:04.620]   But what we're seeing now here is how quickly things can build up.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:08.620]   If I'm in technology, that's what I would worry about as a trade war with China.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.620]   More than anything else.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.620]   But I mean, like, how quickly these protests happen because of Twitter,
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:19.620]   because suddenly, online, a lot of people know that a lot of other people --
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:24.620]   this is what we saw in Arab Spring, where a lot of people know that the other people are doing it quickly
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.620]   and their ability to organize.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.620]   Even disorganized.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.620]   There's some of yours.
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:35.620]   I mean, you look at -- I think it was like a house mom or something in Hawaii decided to do a protest in D.C.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.620]   And before you know it --
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.620]   That thing came to the Women's March.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.620]   Yeah, and it's -- you know, it was mass chaos there.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   We had some guys on the ground there.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.620]   And so it was a little chaotic.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.620]   But it still got massive surge all over the world.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.620]   All right.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.620]   I can move on.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620]   I agree with you, Andy.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:01.620]   I think we need to -- you know, for a lot of people say, "Oh, just stick to tech.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.620]   Stop talking about this."
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620]   First of all, it is tech.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.620]   But second of all, I think if you're a citizen, we have to participate.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.620]   And that sometimes -- that requires this.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.620]   And I don't mind if people stop listening.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.620]   But the mob silence you.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.620]   But the mob silence you.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.620]   What they hear, that's fine.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.620]   I'm willing to take that.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.620]   That's your right.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:23.620]   If on Twitter or whatever, or my blog, I'm saying things that you didn't come to hear and you don't want to hear.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.620]   I'm not saying you're wrong to stop listening.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.620]   I'm not saying that --
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.620]   No, you have the right.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.620]   I'm not saying that I'm right by saying that, "Oh, I'm saying that you have the right to do that.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   Go with God.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620]   Go with the thing.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.620]   But don't expect me to not say what I want to say.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.620]   That's what I want to say.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.620]   No.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.620]   And I encourage you to -- no, no.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.620]   I want every --
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.620]   No, only because otherwise we'll be here until 7th of April.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.620]   We do have to take a break.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.620]   We do have to take a break.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.620]   More to come.
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.620]   And I do want to hear about that LG 5K, Renee Ritchie.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.620]   Yes, sir.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.620]   Our show today is brought to you by Blue Apron.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.620]   Blue Apron is a great choice for anybody who's tired of eating out.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.620]   You know, my trainer the other day said, "How often do you eat out?"
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.620]   I said, "Way too much."
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.620]   He said, "You need to eat at home more often."
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:15.620]   When you eat out, the average restaurant meal -- this was depressing -- 1500 to 2000 calories.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.620]   And that's not good.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.380]   But I understand why people do it.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.380]   I know why I do it.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.620]   At the end of the day, we've been working hard last thing.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.620]   I want to do a plan, a menu, and then go shopping, and then cook a meal.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.620]   I'm starving.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.140]   Well, Blue Apron is nice because when you set it up ahead of time, you tell them when you're
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:33.060]   delivery days, you get to your porch.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:37.220]   There's that Blue Apron box full of beautiful fresh ingredients.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.420]   They're frozen, even the meat and fish, because it's refrigerated.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.300]   And then a card, a beautiful card telling you how you can make it.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.580]   Everything you need to make an amazing meal in about 40 minutes.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:52.180]   A meal that's healthful, much lower in calories, and not only less expensive than the restaurant.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.340]   I think I always said, "Well, it must be more expensive than shopping for myself."
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.340]   No.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.500]   Grocery store is about 60% more expensive than Blue Apron because they don't have the overhead
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.580]   of a grocery store.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.500]   So you're getting a great meal that's good for you.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.180]   You get the fun of cooking it.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.660]   The family, by the way, loves it.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.660]   They have family plans.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.860]   This is the easiest way to be the cool parent on campus.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.660]   I mean, our kids think it's the coolest thing.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.460]   And we've been getting Michael and his friends into cooking.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.660]   And I think what a great thing for a young person to learn how to cook.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.660]   You don't want them--
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   You call it Junior Chef.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.980]   Yeah, you don't want them to get into life and then be eaten out every night.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   That's not economical.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.500]   It's not healthy.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.300]   So Blue Apron, you got to check it out.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:36.100]   It's building a community of home chefs, setting the highest standards for ingredients, supporting
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.580]   a more sustainable food system and making home cooking accessible.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.580]   You're going to make this meal--
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.100]   You're going to say, "I didn't know I could do that.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.100]   Well, doesn't that look good?"
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.100]   Oh, man.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.100]   That's why I said a ramen?
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.100]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.340]   Spicy shrimp and Korean rice cakes with cabbage and furikake.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.620]   Pork chops and garlic pakata with scallion rice and spinach.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.620]   Here's the deal.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.340]   We got three meals free for you.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:06.820]   Right now, Blue Apron.com/MacBreak, three meals free and free shipping, Blue Apron.com/MacBreak
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:12.180]   Bring Home Cooking Back Into Your Life.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.300]   We are talking--
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:18.460]   Apple, we are talking Mac and Tash Andianaco from the Chicago Sun Times, Renee Richie from
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:23.940]   iMore.com, the lovely and talented Alex Lindsey from PixelCore.com.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.460]   Now you got Renee, that 5K monitor.
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.860]   And now we're starting to hear the LG, right?
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.860]   Oh, do we lose Renee?
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   Show Renee.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860]   Where'd you go?
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.860]   Where'd you go Renee?
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860]   He disappeared.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.300]   He's got his patterned distinctive hoodie on.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.300]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.140]   I should have done a little-- waited a little longer to you.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.620]   No, I just wanted to go double check because I knew we were going to talk about it.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.900]   So this morning I set up-- my router is usually across the room from where I use the display.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.620]   So I moved it all, but it's facing the opposite way from where I'm sitting.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:58.100]   I just ran over to double check what it was looking like.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.100]   So there's a couple of things.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.780]   A number of people are saying there's other issues that is causing Macs to crash.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:06.420]   But this story from Circuit Breaker, the 5K monitor, has to be at least seven feet away
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.380]   from your router because of interference.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.860]   Interferes with a hardware router or the Wi-Fi?
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.860]   Router's may-- no, no.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.860]   It's the other way around.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.820]   Router's may affect the performance of the monitor.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.020]   So yeah, I mean, some people are saying that.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.180]   Some people are saying it's fine.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.780]   I usually have mine across the room.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.180]   So this morning I went and I moved it to literally right-- it's like two feet away from-- maybe
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.100]   a one foot away from my router is now.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.100]   And I've left it on all morning and it's fine.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.500]   You know, I have my router next to my television.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:37.100]   Now I'm worried that I didn't know router's put off-- what is it?
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   RF is it an RF issue?
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.580]   Well, they've got Wi-Fi coming out of it.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:46.900]   They've got Wi-Fi coming out of it, but most stuff is shielded against that kind of interface.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.180]   Both my televisions have Wi-Fi routers right next to them.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180]   All right.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:06:00.860]   Well, then I have heard some stories about issues with apples not working well with them.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.660]   Yours works fine with it.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.660]   I bought two.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.660]   They both work fine.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.660]   I've heard those stories too.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.660]   I have a friend who bought one and it was just DOA.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.420]   So we took it back and they exchanged it and the new one is fine.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.500]   I don't know what LG standards are with these things.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.740]   I don't know what kind of shielding they're using.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.740]   I'm trying to find out.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.020]   But I tested it with my stuff and it's working.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.820]   So I'm going to have to look more deeply into what kind of routers are giving people
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.820]   problems.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:25.020]   The latest generation airport extreme, actually the time capsule version and it's fine.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.020]   Okay.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.020]   That does seem like-
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.100]   Maybe there's a combination of weaker than needed shielding on LG and weaker than needed
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.060]   shielding on some of the routers that we have combination.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.580]   I would guess it's something like that.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:42.020]   New shot on iPhone campaign focusing on the evening.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.900]   You want to watch it?
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.900]   Let's see here.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.900]   Do I have that?
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:46.900]   I love that midnight commercial.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:48.900]   The first one for the iPhone 7.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.740]   They used a photographer.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.100]   I will say that I'm kind of amazed.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.340]   I take night shots now with the 7 and I'm pretty amazed at the quality of the-
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.100]   Oh, these are- This isn't a television commercial.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.100]   There is one.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.100]   There is a- There is a-
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.100]   Is there one?
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.100]   A few research for the video.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:06.100]   These are beautiful, 90-
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.260]   Yeah, the commercial's a bit older.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.460]   This is sort of stuff that they went out and shot with afterward.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.560]   This is Shanghai.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.800]   Just shows you really.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   Wow.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.860]   Now, I've been told not to turn off live photos if you're going to shoot at night, right?
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.860]   I've been told not to turn off live photos.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:21.860]   Not anymore.
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.860]   I thought it was something more-
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:23.860]   Not anymore.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.840]   When the very first time it rolled out that some people were thinking that it would down
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:32.540]   sample, it would use less sensitivity for those, but it's all the same system now, so
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.540]   it's fine.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.540]   Okay.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:40.500]   And telephoto is a smaller aperture, so it won't be as good low light.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.020]   Yeah, so you want to use the wide angle.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:47.300]   But the way Apple looks at it, and this is different than some companies, is it's one
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.300]   camera to them.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.420]   The fact that there's two lenses and implementation detail, so if it detects there's not enough
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:56.540]   light, it will just switch back to the higher aperture, so the lower aperture and you won't
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.020]   get the same look, but you'll get better light.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.020]   This is an include.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.100]   You can use third-party apps to force it.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:06.020]   This picture would be incredibly challenging because she's backlit, and normally you would
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.420]   have no detail on her face.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.100]   You'd just see these big bright fluorescent lights.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.620]   Do you think that's portrait mode?
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.020]   I think it is, yeah.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.020]   So maybe the phone's smart enough to-
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.260]   You can see a little bit of cut off here.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.260]   The same is typical portrait mode.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.260]   The little portrait mode.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.260]   The portrait mode.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.260]   The portrait mode.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.260]   A little bit of the hairs getting a little funky.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260]   So this is portrait mode, probably, yeah.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:26.460]   Yeah, you can almost always find a defect if you really pixel-peep on the portrait mode.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.460]   But one of the great things-
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:28.460]   Overall, it's great.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.460]   When it works, it works great.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.460]   It's the feeling, though, the feeling that you bring.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.140]   One of the hidden, really great things about the iPhone's camera is that these pictures themselves
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.100]   out of the camera are really good, but then you'll put it into Lightroom or something,
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.100]   and you'll find that-
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.100]   There's a lot of information.
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:43.620]   Here's a black area with no detail, but it actually did capture a lot of detail there
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.580]   that you can just bring out without making it look weird.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.340]   That would be- If you do that, shoot raw, right?
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.340]   It would be the better way to do it.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.340]   No, no, even if you don't shoot raw.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.340]   Even if you're using JPEGs.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.100]   Apple's app doesn't let you shoot raw, or does it?
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.100]   No.
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.100]   You have to use camera plus or something.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.740]   To get the separate cameras, to get raw, to get manual controls, you have to use it.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.740]   They're pretty good.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.740]   Lightroom camera looks really nice in that.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740]   Lightroom is a good choice.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.740]   That has a camera now.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.860]   Not only that, but the people who are up to appreciate raw, it handles the way that that
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.580]   photographer would want the camera to work really.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.580]   It's very good too.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.580]   Obscura.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.580]   Lightroom is all updated.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.580]   So, get Lightroom for it.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.580]   Even for just for taking pictures, right?
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.860]   If you pay for it, you get some really nice editing and minimum-
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:32.380]   I think most people now are, you know, no savvy about the $10 a month photographer's
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.380]   package.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.580]   You get Photoshop, Lightroom, and you get all those benefits.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.580]   The creative cloud, the syncing, and-
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.940]   My pick of the week is going to be related to that too.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.940]   So, sorry.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.940]   Not that Mac fun 33.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:44.940]   I already dibsied it.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.940]   Oh, man.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.940]   The window is out there.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   The weather is not as well.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.940]   The weather is a spot on who has what pick.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:51.940]   But yeah, I mean-
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:52.940]   He did.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:53.940]   He dibsied it.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:58.220]   Spending so much time testing out the iPhone 7 camera really made me think about how I
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:03.380]   take pictures with, you know, my big, my big, hot, inexpensive, crazy, stupid, like, pro
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.860]   quality, like Olympus camera.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.580]   And I'm probably going to be getting a new camera next month, and it's not going to
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.100]   be the next edition of this, which is a lot to go.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:15.420]   It's going to be a pocket camera that works a lot like the iPhone 7 because it just made
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.420]   me realize that it's kind of fun to just take something out while you're waiting for your
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.460]   car to pick you up and say, "Gee, that church is kind of interesting.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.780]   I wonder how I can frame that."
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:27.380]   I mean, I took the picture you're going to see later on today.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.700]   It's like I was just taking pictures with my phone and I remember that, yeah, excuse
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700]   me.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.340]   Remember that you do have this literally around your shoulder and you can actually take the
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.340]   same picture with a real camera?
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.340]   Oh, that's right.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.340]   Yeah, I forget all this time.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   But you're using an Olympus OM-D-M1.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.260]   And you're going to get a point.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.460]   What about the DXO one?
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460]   I'm not switching.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.460]   Yeah, that's not good.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:48.940]   I've been intrigued by the DXO one.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.980]   That's the camera you plug into the iPhone.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.220]   I still use it all the time.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220]   You use it.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.220]   And now they've had it.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:59.140]   They updated the firmware and they're going to do, you can do multi-camera Facebook live
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:00.140]   streaming with it.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.140]   Eventually.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.140]   They announced it.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.380]   So it's, I mean, I still find that...
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.780]   That's a one-inch sensor.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.780]   One-inch Sony sensor.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   Pretty good sensor.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:14.340]   So it's, I find that I just am not going to carry a camera around.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.380]   So like, you know, just in my, everything to me is weight and size and I, my bag is already
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.220]   50 pounds.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:25.220]   And so, you know, there's no way that I'm adding anything that looks like a regular camera
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.540]   to my bag.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.820]   The only camera that I have added to it is I still have a Fuji W1 or whatever, a little
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   3 camera.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.180]   This cracks me up because you were like the big photo guy.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.740]   I still take photos, but I don't take, but I, but I, you know, I use your phones.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:42.580]   A couple hundred years a year and traveling and I have a big pack full of stuff and I,
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.060]   and I'm not going to add a camera to it.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:48.980]   So, so for me, the DxO works because it is, it is better.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:53.060]   Now, I won't say that I use it every single time I shoot, but there are definitely environments
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.380]   when I'm taking pictures of people and low light.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:02.740]   And I want, I want a shorter depth of field without the artifacts that I get with the
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.740]   iPhone 7.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.860]   You know, those are, you know, and then I also love to be able to swivel.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:13.820]   So I have this thing about being able to swivel and then I actually use the DxO a lot
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:14.820]   without the camera at all.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.820]   And they added the little viewfinder thing.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:17.820]   So I pick it up and just take pictures of it.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:24.460]   I like, I like things I carry in my purse all the time, including my AirPods now.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:30.980]   And an extra battery because of all the other things I'm carrying in my bag and a DxO1
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.660]   and that's sure a microphone for the, for the, but this.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.900]   So the DxO is, you've probably seen this.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.460]   We've talked about this before.
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:42.700]   It's just, it's a, it's a camera without a viewfinder.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.460]   Has a really nice one.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.260]   It now has a viewfinder.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.380]   The same size as you find in a five, six, seven, eight hundred dollar pocket camera.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.620]   So that's now a viewfinder?
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.700]   So you can see what, what it's, what it's got a little, a little like, you feel like James
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.780]   Bond, because you go like this, you're like, you're like, I'm gonna take a picture.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.780]   But that's nice because you can at least see what you're taking a picture of.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.220]   But I can frame it.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.220]   Oh.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.220]   That's the, that's the updated firmware.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:05.220]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.220]   So I do that a lot.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.980]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:13.460]   So it, you know, for me that this is the right management of, and then you can also put it
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.940]   on your, of course, on your phone through the lightning.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:21.020]   And it now has a Wi-Fi so that you can actually separate it from the phone.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.460]   So it still could go all the shot.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:27.020]   I do really like the fact that I wasn't really impressed with it when I had 1.0 like the
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.020]   very first one.
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.020]   One point, this is much better.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.180]   I like the fact that same hardware, but they keep adding, you can just do it.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:37.740]   But the main point is that I wish that everything of computers, particularly, were like the
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.780]   camera market where no matter what it is, you can start off by just simply listening,
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.420]   what do I want a camera to do and what am I willing to carry?
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.180]   And you will find some manufacturer that makes exactly that camera.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.500]   So this, this doesn't work for me, but it's great for you.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.500]   I don't realize you could use it for yourself.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.500]   Right.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.500]   And video too.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500]   And is this shoot, does this shoot wrong?
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.500]   I can't remember.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:04.740]   It records raw to the manual transfer as well, but it records raw internally to a, you know,
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.740]   and then.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.740]   And then, yeah.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:09.740]   And it's good.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:10.980]   And for a lot of people, this is good quality, isn't it?
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.980]   And if you zoom in, it's too bad.
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:18.020]   The guy in the picture isn't so good looking, but the quality is the quality is the piece
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.020]   shot.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.020]   Oh, Pasha.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.020]   Oh, Pasha.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.820]   You've got a profile of Randy Mantooth, a young Randy Mantooth.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:24.820]   I don't even know.
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:25.820]   Emergence.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:26.820]   Emergency.
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.820]   I'm going to have you with the D5W lactate.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.460]   Sam, by Rampart, we're sending you a strip.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:37.260]   I also keep this is actually become the bag of stuff that Alex recommends.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.700]   This is the, uh, the lume cube.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:42.700]   Actually, yeah, maybe like you.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.700]   I think it's between Alex and Andy.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.940]   I've spent a lot of stuff.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:49.300]   This is a, like a little pocket flash that will blind you.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.660]   I got to be careful because when I turn it on, it's, it's awfully bright.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.900]   But I'm just burning.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.980]   Ah, like a phaser.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.980]   In case anybody ever questions like the pics of the week, it's like this.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:01.980]   They're all in there.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:02.980]   At least a half a dozen.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.820]   We'll find out on the screen savers.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.020]   We're going to find out on Saturday and the new screen savers because we did what's in
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.780]   your bag with Andy and I go.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   I'm just, I'm just saying.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.020]   No, I was just going off to the day.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.900]   So I didn't have like one of my, my.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:14.900]   And you finished.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.900]   That we just.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:16.900]   Did you get like three?
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.900]   I'm just looking at like only an hour show.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.900]   We can't.
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.700]   We have a tribe that I don't have.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.860]   This is, this is the, my, my, my go, my go kid.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.220]   I have like high school lunch boxes, like Chinese plastic boxes.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.300]   I still have a baloney.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.780]   I use it on my makeup.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.780]   Have a patch doll.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.780]   Anybody need a wet one?
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   I've got wet ones here.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.060]   Forget Pokemon go.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.020]   I have an actual Pokemon in here.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.020]   All right.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.020]   Enough of that silliness.
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:44.020]   It's like grandma's purse.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.020]   You know what I, all right.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.740]   I think I want a butter scotch.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.820]   I'm sure I got a butter scotch here somewhere.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:52.340]   I am going to mention this because Jason Stell talked me into buying this.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.780]   But I'm not going to do it as a pick yet because I haven't been able to get it to work.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:57.620]   But this is from the folks at DJI.
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.820]   They do a gimbal system, the Osmo mobile.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.260]   You probably have the Osmo with the camera built into it.
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.460]   No, I have the mobile.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.020]   I can't get it to pair.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.460]   I'm wondering if I got a broken one.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:13.620]   What's crazy about the mobile is, is that it not only, once you get it pairing, which
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.900]   I haven't had trouble with, it will do a follow mode.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.260]   So you put that on a tripod.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.620]   And it will, it will grab onto your face and just, and the little.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   Just follow you around.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.060]   It'll just sit there and talk to you.
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.780]   So who needs, really, who needs a camera?
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:32.300]   Now you've got this heavy computational device with a pretty decent lens.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:35.620]   And then you add all of the internet and then you add these adjuncts.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.620]   Who needs a camera?
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.620]   Right?
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:41.180]   Well, I have a different model that came out earlier and nine out of ten times it works
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.780]   perfectly the 10th time it tries to take my life.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   It just starts spinning around.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.300]   Yeah, the one thing about, I will say about the, about the DJI is that when it, when it
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.460]   gets confused, it really just flips out.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.860]   You know, it's not a, it's not like, oh, I'm just going to stay stationary for a second.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:56.860]   It's like, I'm going to go everywhere.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.060]   You know, you know, so, so it definitely can lose its mind.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.900]   Like Tony Stark, I should have brought this in.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.500]   If I knew you would be here, I would have brought it in.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.300]   You could have helped me get this thing.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.820]   Where there's a lot of, it's the easiest gimbal to balance I've ever had because it's designed
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.820]   for it.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:12.940]   It just, it just, it just, although we're with the, the Facebook live integration isn't,
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.420]   isn't great.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.420]   Hopefully they'll unplug that.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.420]   Oh, there it is.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.420]   Snell convinced me to get that.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   Now, great.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.980]   It just wants to kill me again.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.100]   There's also a slider mode, right?
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.860]   Where you can, how does that work?
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.100]   I don't use the slider mode.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.100]   He says the slider we love.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.860]   The fact you introduced us to that, which is a, do we still have our slider, John?
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.460]   We don't ever use it.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.940]   Why not?
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.340]   We don't like it.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.540]   We don't like it.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:42.420]   So maybe it was making people sick because we would put a camera on it and we would just
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.740]   have it go back and forth really slowly and then we'd switch to it every once in a while.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.460]   But you, what you could do is do a time lapse.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.340]   In fact, those great time lapses at the beginning of house and car, house or cars, where it's
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:54.060]   a time lapse, but it's also moving slowly.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.500]   That's how they do those as with a slider.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:00.300]   And I think Jason said that there's some capability in here that can kind of do that
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.300]   as well.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.300]   So I don't know.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:06.180]   Oh, and the other cool thing is that the slow motion's got an attachment on the side.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.780]   It's got like this kind of, what looks like a tripod attachment.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.780]   What is that?
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:11.780]   What is that for?
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.460]   So you can, so what you can do with it is, is we're doing the picks of the week in the
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.780]   middle of the show, I apologize.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:20.700]   But I didn't want to pick this yet because I can't get it to pair.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.220]   I was going to pick it.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.420]   So anyway, you can then.
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.700]   So anyway, so the, it's got a gear on the side.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.500]   Do you have, is that the one you have?
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.660]   It has a little, the little knob on the side.
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:32.660]   I have one too.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.140]   That's not the, that's not the DJI one though, is it?
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.780]   No, that's not the DJI one.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.780]   Okay.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.420]   But mine does it had a little, it has a hole in the side.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.900]   So what you can do is you can, you get, there's attachments that go on to it.
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.700]   So one of the, one of the attachments is a little plate that you can either have things
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.620]   to do or you can use it to attach it to other things.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:56.420]   So you can basically attach the, you can attach the, the mobile, you know, to your car
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.420]   or whatever.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.460]   So one of the problems you're going to do is not attaching the mobile to my car at all.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.340]   I promise you, right now.
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.100]   So you can have a suction cup and you can attach it.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.460]   That's what happened to my GoPro is they were, they suction cupped it to my Tesla to do
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.540]   a piece for the new screen savers.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.700]   And then it fell off and a truck rolled over it.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.460]   You see the better suction cup.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.940]   We fairly never get good.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.940]   It does work better with the iPhone than the software.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.940]   Well, there's, there's some really good, I mean, you get the little GoPro suction, you're
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.860]   kind of screwed, but if you go down and film tools and you get the now, I know, the real
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.780]   suction cup, it'll almost, it'll almost like when you put it on pods.
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:31.780]   It's one, no, it's, well, it's, you, you, I bought it by the way, I bought it because
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.180]   of this now, I know pump it.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.180]   These people are having so much fun.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.100]   I don't want to like, I'm going to take pain off.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.100]   But after a few minutes, Leo, you're just carrying around something and it's awkward.
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.820]   To do with this show, I don't know if they're going to show that little attachment, but the
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.820]   attachment's great.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:49.180]   All these people are just, their lives are so much better than mine.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.180]   How do you ride an ostrich?
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.700]   Where do you look at that?
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   This is a studly guy.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:57.460]   His leather jacket, shooting a canyon, nine photo, photo stream.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.540]   I got some things never, ever changed.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.780]   You have the people like when like eight millimeter.
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.020]   Oh, there's your, that's it.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.020]   That's that's what I was doing.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.020]   It's doing a slow rotate.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.020]   Slow rotate.
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:14.620]   You put the camera, it's just put, you put the camera in time lapse, you put it on a tripod
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.060]   and then you let it slowly rotate.
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.060]   Okay.
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.060]   I get it.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.060]   It's kind of, it's right where you enter books where this, you take that cap off.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   I have that, that whole.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.060]   You take that cap off.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.060]   And they've got more expensive stuff.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.060]   Look at accessories on here.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.060]   You'll see it, but it's what I don't want to look at.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.060]   It's the last thing I want to look at is accessories.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.060]   Can you mount one on each shoulder?
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.060]   I'm one of those guys.
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.900]   I buy them and I just buy all the accessories.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:34.900]   I go up.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:35.900]   You just say, well, I know I'm going to need it.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.900]   So I'm just going to buy it now.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.900]   I am going to run some engines.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.900]   Don't bother getting up.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.420]   You're going to see dramatic long exposures.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.420]   Where's the accessory page?
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.420]   I shouldn't do this.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.540]   You remember seeing like the parents at the sidelines talk to a game that are clearly
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:52.980]   taking the video way too seriously where they got the, they got the bank lights and they
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:56.620]   got the super plastic zoom and it's like, or you could just store it.
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:59.020]   I was going to have a memento of your kid and hear a mic.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.020]   Oh, there's a black door.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.020]   Okay.
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:02.020]   Iron.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.020]   Oh, here it is.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.020]   There's tripods.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.020]   Somewhere, somewhere in the family archives, I have a picture of like me at like, I'm going
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.380]   to be at like five or six years old.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:12.860]   I should have put like a sequence of photos of me smiling in the basement holding up index
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.980]   cards that says F five point, F five and four, F seven, F five point six because my dad like
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:22.300]   got some new lenses and he wanted to see like what the different apertures did.
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:23.300]   So that's me.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:28.180]   I don't know where they're looking looking like, you know, a prisoner of a hostage holding
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.180]   a proof of life.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.180]   It's love.
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:35.620]   It's love actually, but with Andy and cars about aperture.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:36.620]   Let's see.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:38.340]   Oh, you want to see the Apple campus?
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.940]   It's time for fly, fly over.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.420]   Actually, there'll be a new fly over 2017.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:47.300]   Oh, this is, this is the January 30th fly over.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.820]   There are two guys doing these.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.260]   There's Matthew Roberts and this is his.
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.260]   Let's take a look.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.260]   See what's going on.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.260]   We're getting close.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.260]   They can fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.260]   We're getting close.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.900]   They're all in wars.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.060]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.940]   So this is as much as that looks like a 3D rendering.
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:04.940]   That's real.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:08.380]   Water accumulation from last month's storm still visible.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:11.100]   That's the new pool.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.620]   Are they doing gold mining?
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.900]   Is that the response?
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:18.380]   So that the mud is, the mud hill is gone now.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:19.460]   So they must be getting close.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:22.620]   What do you think the first event is going to be there?
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.380]   I think it'll be this year, right?
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.380]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.540]   Solar panels almost 70% done.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.780]   They're all the way around the ring.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   Pretty nice.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:32.140]   It feels like they'd have to do the iPhone 1 there.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.940]   I think maybe that's the first one.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.540]   I don't think September.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.580]   I was speculating that maybe they would have the auditorium
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:42.260]   done first because they don't necessarily
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:44.260]   have to take people any deeper into the campus and that.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.180]   It's designed to be just low lives.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.260]   Like journalists can just go in and get out.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:52.540]   But maybe they're going to wait until the iPhone event
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.820]   so that they can take certain people in for the full nickel
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.100]   tour, the full e-ticker.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.100]   Oh, wouldn't that be correct?
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.780]   It's fully operational.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.420]   So basically, it's the only way they'll do it.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.020]   It's actually paid the parking lot.
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:04.780]   That's pretty close.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.700]   If you've got a parking lot paved--
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.420]   The old building's going to add EQ's team.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:11.500]   It's going to be the new iTunes or services and HQ.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.460]   You mean one infinite loop is Eddy too?
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:13.940]   Oh.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.180]   So that's what their current rumor is.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:15.820]   Or Eddy.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.660]   He must feel excited.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.380]   Well, no, but they want it to get--
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.740]   they're so spread about--
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.500]   He's not crossing the river Jordan.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.620]   Like he's stuck on the air.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:25.940]   This doesn't mean that they're going to be selling off.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.180]   Oh, they need every desk that they can get.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:29.660]   This is just adding.
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:33.660]   It doesn't kill them that they have the one infinite loop.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.380]   It still looks like the company that
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.100]   makes all of the Mac 2 CI and Mac 2.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.100]   It does feel--
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.940]   It does.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.300]   I think it looks great.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.540]   It has that far-drug design sort of influence.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.780]   Maybe a little tear-rock down the portico
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.460]   and just put one big sheet of curved glass.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.700]   We've all been there.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.540]   We've all been in the meetings in there.
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.500]   It feels to me like this ghost of Steve's jobs is still there.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.460]   It has his office.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.540]   They did it.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:58.860]   That's right.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.180]   They never changed it.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.140]   Construction-- look at this.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:03.980]   It's really actually quite close to being done.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.500]   They're doing landscaping around the auditorium.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.020]   That's that circle.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.740]   I still say they missed a trick by just not having that.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.060]   I didn't realize it was outside.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.180]   I thought for some reason I thought it was in the center.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:14.700]   No, no.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.980]   It seems that the theater's outside.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.740]   It's like the whole button.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.340]   I'm sure they want to have a place where
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.780]   they can allow a crowd in without allowing them
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:26.740]   onto the campus, just like the CHX Theater at Lucasfilm,
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:30.580]   where IOM, where they can host an event or screening,
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.220]   where you go into the lobby, you take a left,
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.540]   and now you're in this huge beautiful THX Theater,
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.340]   where actually they put it deep in the campus
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:37.740]   if they're having a screening.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.140]   Oh, that's the new IOM.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.900]   I'm sorry, the one-- the studio.
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:42.420]   Yes, exactly.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:43.060]   Sorry.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:43.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.940]   I forgot what I was talking to.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:47.940]   Do you guys like-- do you mean the office they had in 1977?
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.860]   Do you used to have the door of the--
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:52.660]   there's a theater in the tech building in Skywalker
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:55.680]   Ranch, which is what I think of as a THX Theater, in place
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.240]   I've never been, but you've once or twice
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.140]   said that you can get me invited.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:59.880]   That's OK.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.560]   Totally forgot about that.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.360]   Ooh, retractable atrium doors.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.920]   So on a nice day they can open it up.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.720]   Wednesday at the library, like I planned before I go home.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.880]   They can drive in one day, Lee.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.280]   Drive in.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.600]   Crane's still lifting materials.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:10.960]   Oh, he looks like--
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.880]   Well, actually, they probably do need that to access--
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.040]   I mean, is that how they access the center?
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.480]   They must drive through somewhere, right?
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.000]   Or maybe there's an underground portal.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.800]   It looks like a giant touch ID sensor,
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.120]   because it's so far away from the middle.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.200]   Future Fitness Center.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.200]   That's what I'm planning for.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.120]   Future Fitness.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.600]   That's my relationship with Fitness.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600]   Yeah, it'll be in the future.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.120]   Future Fitness.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   Yeah, someday I have that in my house.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.720]   I have a Future Fitness Center.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.280]   It's like half a garage.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.240]   There are several separate buildings out there as well.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:39.960]   It's great.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.440]   I mean, it's got everything I need in the future.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.960]   So clearly, Apple knows about these videos
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.240]   and doesn't stop people from doing them.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.240]   They could shoot them down.
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.600]   It'd be really hard to stop them from doing it.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.800]   They'd have to really own the airspace.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.600]   Yes, there are rules for flag drones.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.760]   So long as that person doesn't violate them.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.520]   I don't think you can--
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.360]   I don't think you can--
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   maybe say that--
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.480]   You can't in the United States.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.000]   You can't fly over somebody else's commercial property, can you?
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.720]   But you maybe shouldn't, but you obviously physically can.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.000]   And I know these are all the articles.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.800]   I guess in Davos, they had the jammers there.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.240]   So they were basically like, if you fly a drone,
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.560]   we're going to take it down.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.400]   We're going to take it down.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.400]   Wow.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.200]   Apple, apparently, according to sources,
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.520]   Alex Webb in Bloomberg, going to join that AI research group that was--
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:30.840]   They did.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.320]   It's official.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.600]   It was official.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.720]   Yeah, the day before yesterday was not really, really good.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:35.240]   I don't think so.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:35.920]   OK.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.600]   Amazon, Alphabet, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.520]   It's a nonprofit that was created to kind of--
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.880]   it's such a new branch that there are a lot of things that they--
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.720]   it isn't like a marketing promotional group.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.400]   It really is.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.640]   We have no idea what we're doing and what important safeguards
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.680]   and what important techniques we should be applying.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.360]   Let's have at least an official conduit
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.240]   so we can talk about such things.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.480]   You're talking about simple things,
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.560]   like let's say that you've got AI applied towards medical diagnostics.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.600]   Is it ethical to have the AI give a diagnosis,
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.160]   or is it only ethical to have it give information
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.760]   that another person can apply?
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.000]   And if you are--
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.200]   let's say that you are a scientist working for an insurance
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.480]   company, is it OK to teach that AI that, yeah,
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.520]   here's the-- to teach the AI is to say that this is not
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.680]   a recommended course of action because it's
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.000]   going to cost more money than we would really like to spend.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.440]   All the way down to just a simple stuff that just
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.280]   has to be discussed.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:46.480]   Like the classic self-driving car with two passengers inside
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.200]   can do something dramatic and kill the two passengers
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.480]   by saving five.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.760]   What do we do in that circumstance?
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.480]   And then there is also the actual bandwidth.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.800]   The other thing that someone was telling me about
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.600]   was just the idea of eliminating--
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.000]   you think that you're stealing with databases,
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.920]   you're dealing with numbers.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.440]   So you think that you've created a perfect logic.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.000]   But because you're the person who taught the AI how
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.400]   to spot trees in a picture, now it's prejudiced.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.760]   It has prejudices.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.320]   Now it's just your prejudices.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.960]   So how do you lead those things up?
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.720]   And one of the things that, yeah, we--
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.840]   I worked in a company that was doing artificial life
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.400]   in the early '90s, a little ahead of its time.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:34.800]   And the thing that you would see it do every once in a while
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:40.200]   is it would find a way to solve a problem in a radical fashion.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.000]   So it would radically change how it's doing it.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.600]   It would be like, I'm going to do something normal, normal,
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.160]   normal, normal, normal.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.600]   And then suddenly it would make a decision.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.400]   And it's not that it was necessarily wrong,
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.080]   but it wasn't taking into account everything
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.720]   that could go wrong when it did that.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.480]   So it would just suddenly decide that now I should
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.160]   flip it all this way and turn everything 90 degrees.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.600]   And if it did that with traffic, it'd be chaos.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.200]   Here's some news.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.520]   Andy's just handing me--
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.360]   Oh, no, this is--
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.520]   Renee said a link to the member of the Apple--
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.160]   Tom Gruber, the Apple--
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.280]   it's not contributed to the board of this AI group.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.400]   OK.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.160]   He was the co-founder of CTO and head of design at Siri.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.480]   So when Apple acquired Siri, Gruber joined the Apple team.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.080]   And now he's going to work over at the AI group.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.760]   Cool.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.760]   No relation to John.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.760]   And you have a quarter of Trustee.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.680]   No, or Hans.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.200]   Or Hans.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:28.480]   Or Hans Gruber.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.080]   Who's Hans Gruber?
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.040]   He's on the board of Trustees.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.320]   And they have a bunch of different members.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.280]   And there's people from all the companies you'd expect there,
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.200]   but also people from the ACLU and people
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.120]   from economic advisory boards.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.680]   And it's a big new open area.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.320]   And they really like to discuss their incredible academics.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.560]   And they like to publish.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.840]   And he says to a new and fertile ground
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.920]   that they want to be working collaboratively on this.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:55.560]   Is this related to the nonprofit AI.org?
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.160]   I guess it's not that Elon Musk are.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.160]   This is a separate thing.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.440]   No, this is coming together really quickly.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.800]   This isn't like the Apple--
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.680]   It's almost like an advisory board.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.520]   Well, it started off in September.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.480]   Again, it's more like they need a lot of brains available
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.000]   in this.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.640]   And even things like just practical things,
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.240]   like how do you debug an AI when the AI is teaching itself
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.120]   and you really don't know how this--
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.480]   you didn't create this code, but you
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.400]   have to figure out, understand how this stuff works.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.640]   It's telling that we're not far enough along
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.720]   that it's a competitive environment yet that everybody--
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.440]   Well, also, right now, we're still dealing
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.480]   with the people who are-- the most important people
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.520]   in this field are still researchers and scientists.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.960]   And the currency for a scientist
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.440]   isn't how much money you give them.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.440]   It really is how many papers do I get to publish?
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.440]   How soon can I share my findings?
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.640]   So if you are in a secretive organization like Google
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.320]   or Apple, where they're saying, no, you're not even
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.720]   allowed to acknowledge that you're working on AI at Apple,
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.360]   that's going to say I would much rather get $50,000 a year
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.640]   at a PODUNK University, where I'm allowed to do my research
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.120]   and then publish and appear at all these conferences
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:02.120]   and present papers, then be making 10 times as much money,
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.560]   but nobody knows what I'm doing.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.560]   And I can't benefit from other people's ideas.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.880]   Right.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.560]   The partnership on AI's tenets, we
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.120]   will seek to ensure that AI benefits and empowers as many
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.520]   people as possible.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.080]   We'll educate and listen to the public
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:19.480]   and actively engage stakeholders to seek their feedback
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.920]   on our focus and form them of our work
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.080]   and address their questions, committed
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.800]   to open research and dialogue on the ethical, social, economic,
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.280]   and legal implications of AI.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.920]   Yeah, that makes a long sense.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.840]   Thank goodness, frankly, you'd hate
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.240]   to see people all working in separate labs,
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.280]   coming up with Robocop or something.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.640]   Yes.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.480]   They should work together to make one Robocop that nobody
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.240]   can destroy.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.280]   Let's take a break.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.160]   We got to get some pics from you guys.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.640]   We kind of did a whole pic segment
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.040]   without getting to our official pics.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.440]   We'll do that in a moment.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.040]   Andy Inaco visiting us in the studio
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.160]   is great to have you from Chicago Sun Times.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.640]   Hatless.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.400]   Not wearing the big brimmed hat.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.160]   Oh, because it's not surgically implanted.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.920]   You made me wear more hats, though.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.680]   My hair, usually the threshold for wearing the hat on the show
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.400]   is usually-- is my hair 70% goofy or more?
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.600]   68% so I won't wear it.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.480]   Also, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.120]   and follow Alex on his Twitter account,
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:26.320]   because we missed the final cut.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.280]   No, it's Thursday.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.320]   Oh, it's coming up this week.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:28.920]   Yes, Thursday.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:34.320]   So if you want to see a machine host a show--
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.760]   Osmo.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.360]   The Ozo.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.480]   See, I confuse those.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.480]   Yes.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.960]   Ozo is no-- is no key a $60,000.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:42.680]   $45,000.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.560]   Oh, they reduced the price.
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.560]   $45,000?
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.160]   It's a bargain, $45,000.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.640]   360 degree camera.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.120]   Yes.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.680]   They'll be used for live streaming.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.200]   And so we're going to let the Ozo actually host the show.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:57.120]   I'm going to take the day off and we'll let it run the show.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:57.760]   Oh, come on.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.440]   And then you can jump into a tablet like John Malkovich.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.280]   You're going to be talking to a microphone like this
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.120]   in the back of the room.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:02.320]   I'm not.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.840]   Code name Leno.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.800]   I always hate that at CES that have a robot walking around
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.120]   and there'll be some guy covertly walking behind a car.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:09.920]   Hi.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.600]   What's your name?
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.760]   Do a little microphone.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.080]   Hi.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:20.240]   Also from iMoor.com and Morial, it's iMoor's man about town,
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.080]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:21.960]   I'm so far away.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:22.640]   Can you hear me?
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.140]   Yes.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:23.640]   Shout.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.880]   Can you hear me?
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.880]   Shout.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.800]   Oh, and I didn't mention one other story.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.960]   We'll throw this in real quickly.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.680]   If you're taking the bar in February,
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.880]   North Carolina, the bar exam, disable your touch bar.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.080]   Or else.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.080]   You can't take the bar off the bar.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:40.600]   Actually, they're not the only ones.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.120]   Apparently, this is a new trend.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:44.440]   And first of all, I didn't know you could bring a laptop
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:45.360]   into the bar exam.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.200]   That seems like that's the problem.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:47.660]   You can.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.880]   I think that you get the booklet,
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.760]   but then you can enter the answers on your computer.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.880]   You could type it in.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.640]   OK.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.560]   But they want you to disable the touch bar because why?
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.200]   Because you--
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.120]   Predictive text.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.960]   Because you do something that lawyers do.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.280]   Yeah, text expand it or something.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.520]   I don't think it'd be much of a cheating device.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.680]   But OK.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680]   I didn't actually know--
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.680]   Also, though, about calculators and no abacus sizes.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.680]   Abacusi, I don't--
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:12.880]   They told me there'd be no math in this test.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.720]   No math.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.040]   How can you turn off the touch bar?
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.360]   Is there is a switch to do that?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.240]   Because I wouldn't mind doing that.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.720]   We have a-- Laurie Gillan.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.560]   I'm Aurora Houtu.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.680]   And how did I disable every take?
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.120]   Does it disable touch ID?
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:28.960]   I don't believe so, no.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:29.560]   No.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.240]   Well, that's all I want.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.160]   It's touch ID.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.440]   You're not using a chisel to pull it out of the system.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:33.960]   Oh, good.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.120]   Thank you.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.760]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.840]   If you're a small business or you're a sole proprietor,
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.000]   I think you know that the worst time of the month
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.160]   is the end of the month when you have to send out invoices.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.360]   Us are such a pain.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.920]   But if you don't send them, you don't get them, you don't get paid.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.720]   That's why I found FreshBooks--
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.440]   it's been more than 10 years ago.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.480]   I started using FreshBooks.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.240]   It was in 2004.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.120]   Nice company out of Toronto.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.040]   They just started up.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:04.360]   And they made it really easy to make great looking invoices
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.160]   that I could send out.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.240]   They did all the calculations for currencies
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.280]   because I was sending out invoices in Canadian dollars.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.360]   They handle every currency.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.440]   They handle expenses.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.480]   You use the FreshBooks app.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.960]   You take a picture of the receipt,
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.640]   gets it right into the invoice.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.240]   And all of this was huge for me.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.360]   Plus, it only took me about 30 seconds to make an invoice.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.880]   And I have to fire up Excel and Word and do all that stuff.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.720]   Now, over time, they've gotten more and more complete.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.320]   And now, really, in many ways, it is a small business accounting
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:33.800]   software.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.320]   It starts with the invoices, as always.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.880]   But because they know what your expenses are,
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.040]   they know what your accounts receivable are.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.080]   They know which invoices have been paid and which not.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.200]   You now have a dashboard.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.840]   This is the brand new redesign FreshBooks.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.880]   On the front page, it tells you your profit or loss.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.640]   It tells you everything you need to know,
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.320]   invoices are outstanding, which invoices haven't been paid
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.960]   but have been read that you can actually
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.200]   see that an invoice has been read.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:02.840]   FreshBooks.com/Macbreak.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.480]   If you'd like to know more, freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.680]   Actually, here's the best way to get fresh books.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.040]   It's free for the first 30 days at freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.360]   Did you know that fresh books users get paid an average
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:23.560]   of 11 days faster because it's so easy for your clients to pay.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.200]   There's just a button.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:24.880]   They push the button.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.680]   Boom, they get paid.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.000]   You can brand your invoices, set recurring invoices,
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   auto payment reminders, automatic late fees.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.400]   It's all in there.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:37.200]   Team time sheets, of course expense tracking
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.560]   by vendor, by category.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.320]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak, a 30 day unrestricted free trial.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.840]   And if you're already a freshbooks user
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.600]   and you haven't taken a look at the new dashboard do,
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.880]   oh, you're going to love it.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.400]   I was so impressed.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.880]   FreshBooks.com/macbreak.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.760]   Let's get Renee Ricci's pick of the week.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.280]   OK, so my pick is called Linea.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.200]   It is a new app.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.000]   I'm just unlocking it on my iPhone here.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.880]   From the icon factory, our good friends at the icon factory.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.160]   And it's a drawing app.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.160]   Now, you might think that you have 800 million drawing
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.880]   apps for your iPad already.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.400]   But this is by the icon factory.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.840]   And they make awesome, awesome stuff.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.840]   I love their stuff, yeah.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.440]   I have, of course, a profongtery Batman
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.840]   that I was bootling during the show just to get it up and running.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.520]   But it's exactly what the name implies.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.960]   It's a very-- I don't want to call it bare bones because it's not.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.560]   But it's an incredibly focused drawing app.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.480]   It doesn't overwhelm you with tools,
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.800]   but all the tools you need are just right there
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.000]   and doesn't overwhelm you with modes,
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.560]   but it has all the modes you want.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.760]   And I really love the pencil.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:40.120]   Like, to me, the pencil is the mark of a good drawing app.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.560]   And like, Apple Notes has a good pencil paper,
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.320]   has a really, really good pencil,
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.200]   procreate a good pencil.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.520]   This, too, like, drawing with the pencil,
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.520]   it just-- thanks to the way that the Apple pencil itself works,
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.360]   and you don't have a gap.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.320]   You don't have parallax.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.720]   You don't have a little reticule.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.840]   It just-- it feels like a real drawing experience.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.920]   And that's what I get with this.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.920]   I can get in, start a drawing, sketch out what I want,
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:02.080]   and immediately have that idea in front of me.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.640]   And their back story to this is--
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.560]   Gideon Mayhill was one of the leads on this,
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.080]   and they just made an app they could use internally.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.800]   And they liked it so much.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.520]   They decided to polish it up and make it a real App Store app.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.520]   It is $10 because they want to charge a sustainable price for it
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.360]   because a lot of apps on the App Store,
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.080]   they start out gangbusters at low prices,
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.000]   and then they end up either getting sold or discontinued
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   because the developer can't afford to keep making it.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.520]   But this is for $10 to me.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.080]   It's a phenomenal app.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:32.800]   They have a really good graph paper.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.120]   I forget the name of it in video isometric modes.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.760]   You have an isometric grid if you want to draw that way.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.720]   There's graph paper.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:41.000]   There's just all sorts of really, really cool, really,
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.360]   really well thought out, really opinionated choices here.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.600]   And I've just been having a blast with it.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.960]   So if you like drawing on the iPad,
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.480]   there is a new app to lose yourself.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.720]   10 bucks.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.680]   Yes.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.720]   Well worth the money and more.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.520]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.880]   All right, now did I take away Alex Lindsey?
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.360]   Did I-- I didn't even know you were going to--
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.360]   I should have looked.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:02.880]   I too.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.120]   You were going to mention the Osmo.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:04.960]   I was going to mention the Osmo.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.160]   We already talked about that.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.840]   So my other pick is a software pick,
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:10.640]   and I actually emailed you a before and after photo.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:14.080]   Oh, well let me get it up here on my special super duper.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:14.960]   But the--
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.120]   Kompooper.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.840]   So the other one is called Landmark Lens.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:24.600]   And so I-- this one I just was experimenting with.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:27.840]   And I downloaded just about every one of these on the phone.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.160]   Now you can do this in Photoshop.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:29.680]   This is a map.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.720]   Yeah, so you can take a bunch of images in Photoshop
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.000]   and actually remove all the people
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.200]   if you get enough samples.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.640]   In this case, but I wanted something--
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.000]   I wanted to play with something that you could do on the phone
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:42.920]   as an experiment.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:47.000]   And so what I did is I got this one.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.400]   And what you can do is you basically turn it on,
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.760]   and it just starts comparing all the images that it's getting.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.080]   Let's turn the video on.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:56.240]   And it just slowly removes everybody.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.000]   So what?
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.760]   And if you-- you'll see some of the test--
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.520]   So here's the before.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.080]   You made the man's little like a four.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.920]   Oh, oh.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.080]   That's the before.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:06.840]   This is the before.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.200]   OK, so there's people-- this is Angkor Wat.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.720]   OK, there's people walking through Angkor Wat.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:15.280]   And then if you go to the next image--
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:15.800]   What?
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.920]   So it's cumulatively adding in.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.520]   And there's a couple little--
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.240]   there's a couple little artifacts on the top.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.720]   I didn't-- I wait long enough for it.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.640]   But in general, now what doesn't work
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.280]   is if tour guides turn out to be like your nemesis.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.160]   Because why?
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160]   Stop.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.000]   A group stops.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.800]   And what it does is it builds up going, oh, maybe
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.440]   that's part of the photo.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.600]   Oh, so it works better with people moving.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.880]   Yeah, when you have a lot of people
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.280]   wandering around and moving around,
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.520]   and you leave it sit for a little bit.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.080]   So this guy in the red back here just didn't move enough.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.000]   Didn't quite move enough.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:45.720]   So he's there.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.840]   And if I go see you--
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.720]   He might have to go through there and still
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.440]   a little bit there.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:49.680]   Touch a Photoshop if you want.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:52.320]   Or if I left it a little longer, I was getting impatient.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.120]   This is kind of amazing.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.400]   Is using photos or is it using 4K video frames?
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.440]   What's the workflow?
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.360]   You know, I am not sure.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.200]   You take a picture.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:00.920]   You turn it on.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.800]   You basically turn the camera on.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.280]   OK.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.160]   And you hit go, and it just starts taking--
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:06.680]   I think it's a tripod.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.360]   Do you need to take a tripod?
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.400]   Yeah, you definitely need a tripod.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.560]   Because it's comparing pixel to pixel on that process.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.880]   So stuff that doesn't move is permanent.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.600]   Yeah, so what happens is it just slowly builds up.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.640]   How long does this take?
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.800]   This took a couple minutes.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.240]   About a minute.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:21.800]   That long.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.800]   OK.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.320]   A minute.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.160]   It's nice.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.920]   Doesn't seem like there's any degradation
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.520]   in the quality of the image.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.560]   No, the image is still high quality.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.120]   As I said, if you let it-- when you get it just right,
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.200]   I said I had a little bit of some artifact
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.040]   from the guy in the red shirt.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.000]   But I took a couple other ones and people were gone.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:39.920]   I just like this one better.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.080]   You could tweak it.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.280]   Yeah, you could tweak it.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:42.720]   And--
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.320]   Yeah, I see a few people up on the steps.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.640]   That's obviously people who looky lose.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.760]   They just stand there looking.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.880]   Yeah, so you do get very impatient with people.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.080]   They're like, come on, move.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.440]   I'm impressed because these are trees.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.240]   And I assume there was a little bit, right?
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.280]   But it doesn't look like the blur that happens when you're
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:00.680]   doing--
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.040]   You can see a little bit of stuff where it's moving.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.760]   If you go back and forth, you'll see it in the trees.
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.160]   But it's a cool--
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:06.880]   and I downloaded it.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.280]   There's one called, I think, Taurus D. Racer
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.640]   and a couple other ones.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.240]   And I just didn't find that I was--
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.520]   Taurus D. Racer aptly named.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:13.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:18.040]   And so I downloaded a bunch of them that I could find.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.000]   And if anyone finds a better one, let me know.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.600]   But right now, this is the best one.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.880]   It's called Landmark Lens.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:25.400]   Landmark Lens.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.360]   No, it's a couple bucks.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.200]   So it's not particularly expensive.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.320]   And it's a fun one to play with.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:31.680]   It won't always work.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.320]   But it's definitely worth noodling with.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.120]   Boy, I wonder if this is what filmmakers use
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.360]   when they want to have an empty city street in New York City?
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.040]   Well, a lot of times what we used to do
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.120]   is that used to be a very manual process to build.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.560]   Like if you look at-- I don't remember 405 of the movie.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.360]   That was a lot of photos of the 405 locked off.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.440]   And then you then repainting it by hand to do this,
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.680]   where this would have-- especially with cars,
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.200]   you could probably create an empty--
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:06.840]   on a highway, it'll do a pretty darn good job.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.520]   I was doing it in an intersection.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.360]   And of course, while all the stopping is starting,
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.080]   I couldn't quite get rid of everything.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.560]   But anyway, it's cool.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.060]   It's neat.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:17.560]   It's fun.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.800]   LandmarkLens.com.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.840]   Andy Enoco, I'm going to let you have it.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:23.340]   OK.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:23.960]   Well, this is--
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.280]   I'm excited, though, about this.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:30.280]   Yeah, the folks at MacFun, they have
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.520]   had a previous pick of the week in which they're
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.520]   denoise utility, which is just amazing at improving
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.280]   a phone picture and getting rid of noise.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.320]   They have a new app called Luminar
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:45.000]   that is the most modern photo editing app you can imagine.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.900]   It's not like Photoshop, where here is your picture,
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:50.820]   here are some tools for going to the picture.
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:53.740]   It really does work a lot like Instagram,
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.020]   but imagine that at a pro level, where--
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:57.180]   It's got layers.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:00.420]   It's got all the Photoshop style sliders.
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:02.500]   I don't want people to be intimidated by, oh, layers
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.020]   and masking, and it does have those features.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:08.660]   But we're talking about tools like Smart Tone, which is not
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.380]   something you find.
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:12.340]   It's a very consumer level sort of thing,
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:14.620]   where I'm going to push the slider.
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:16.700]   But when I change the exposure, I'm
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.840]   going to understand that you just want this to be brighter.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.540]   You don't want highlights to be blown out,
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.400]   so I'm going to prevent that from happening.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.440]   Things like Vibrance, here's a polarizing filter,
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.200]   the effects of adding a photo polarizing filter.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.920]   And not only that, but when you open it up,
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.440]   you have a very, very simple, uncluttered interface.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:41.320]   But it also has this big hopper full of other filters to it.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.160]   For instance, I took a picture of a church
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.280]   while I was waiting for my pickup.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:51.040]   And so here's a tool that is a split color warmth.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:55.000]   The picture that I took has a beautiful blue sky with clouds.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.960]   And it has a church that's painted
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.040]   in oranges and browns and tans.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:04.040]   So normally-- let's see, I'd like to warm up the church
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.840]   a little bit, so those colors pop a little bit.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.360]   Oh, no, now I've made the sky a little bit yellow,
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.400]   a little bit green.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.440]   So with split color warmth, you can
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:14.400]   say set a different color tone for the warm colors
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.560]   and the cool colors.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.680]   So I can just by sliding this, now I've just
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.240]   gone and made the church a lot more sun-setty.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.400]   But I've now taken the cool colors
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.800]   and made the clouds a lot more white,
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.560]   without screwing up the thing.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.360]   That's really cool.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.560]   And here, removing haze.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.880]   And that beautiful denoise filter
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.240]   is also there in the menu bar.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.520]   So if you want to edit that as well.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.360]   So there's a lot of automated stuff.
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.920]   But you can get manual if you want to, right?
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:41.760]   I mean, it's not--
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.760]   Oh, yeah, no, if you want to add masks,
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.560]   if you want to do Photoshop-y things,
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.520]   I'm going to select a certain section,
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.560]   make that a layer mask, and then only effect that.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.520]   It's got curves.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:53.080]   But that's what intimidates a lot of people
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.640]   by thinking that, why I need to take a Photoshop course.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:01.240]   No, a lot of the filters that this app has is, OK,
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.040]   I think I know what you're going for here.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.280]   Just push the slider to the left or to the right
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.840]   until you get what you want.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.320]   And it's just so much fun.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   It really is the difference between deciding
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.200]   that you're not satisfied with your two-year-old iPhone.
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.960]   And saying, actually, the only thing I don't like about my iPhone
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.240]   6 is that I wish I had the better camera.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.560]   But if you spend $70 for Luminar and then spend two minutes,
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.680]   maybe five minutes tweaking things in this app,
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.800]   you will get pictures that are probably better
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.840]   than what will come straight out of the iPhone.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.640]   And if you have an iPhone 7, it'll
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.800]   get even four times as much good pictures.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.120]   And if you have a really good pro camera,
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.520]   then, oh, my goodness, it's like every single time
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.840]   that you have opened up a National Geographic or something
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:46.120]   and wonder, why do my landscapes never look that good?
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.760]   Because they have lots of great software.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.120]   They have 10 years of experience in using it.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.400]   But now you can have Luminar.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.480]   And I now know how to make the orange church with the blue sky
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.280]   look like it would look in a National Geographic picture.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.040]   Really, really love this.
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.480]   And inexpensive, which I like.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.200]   Yeah, $70 bucks and you own it.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.000]   And interestingly, I don't know if this
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.440]   is a sign of the times, but they say a Windows version coming.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.120]   And I don't think Mac Fun's ever done Windows stuff.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:13.760]   So I wanted--
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.680]   Give it a Mac Fun.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.840]   Yeah, Mac Fun for Windows tells you something, doesn't it?
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.400]   I can't log in for some reason into my Dropbox account today.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.800]   So I can't show you paper working.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.720]   But Dropbox has gone live with this.
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.720]   If you use Dropbox, this is their kind of competition
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:33.800]   for Google Drive.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:37.840]   It's a note-taking app that's free, that comes with it,
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.000]   that's cloud-based, very visual, which I like.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.320]   Very easy to edit.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.800]   Collaborative, you have a button right on the top there
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.960]   that says, who's this shared with?
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.120]   It's a lot like Google Drive as if Google Drive had graphics
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.160]   and color and looked good and had fonts and stuff.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.880]   And so people who've been using the Google Docs on Macs
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.800]   and saying, why is this so ugly?
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.640]   Dropbox New Paper, really, is great.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.120]   And it's completely-- it's very cloud-focused, very graphical.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.520]   I think it's just came out.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.760]   I think it's going to be very interesting.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.720]   I think everybody has some Dropbox stuff.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.080]   You can use Calendar Sync.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.080]   You can put tasks in there.
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:21.320]   There's a lot of information.
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:23.640]   So paper is now out of beta.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.040]   And if you're a Dropbox customer,
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.000]   there's probably something worth looking at.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of this Mac break.
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:33.400]   Weekly, the all-in-studio version,
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.960]   except for Renee Richie, who's in his Montreal lair.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.920]   In a box?
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.200]   We couldn't tenant him out.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.760]   We just turned away at the border.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.040]   In the line of jokes.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.440]   You joke and not go.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.200]   I wonder, will this affect your ability
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.120]   to come to the United States?
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.200]   I don't know, because you hear what people are saying,
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.440]   but then you look at Twitter and there are people
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.160]   from all sorts of places who are getting stopped
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.080]   and asked for social media accounts for it.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.480]   I read a story about four women who
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:03.240]   were coming down for the Washington March Canadians,
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:09.880]   not of any terrorist stripe, who were turned back.
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.760]   Well, so that I can partially understand,
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.720]   because they said they were going down to protest.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:15.360]   And if you tell that to customs,
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.480]   they may be hesitant to let you in.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.160]   I mean, good on them for telling the truth,
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.480]   but that might be a reason where they decided
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:22.760]   that it'd be better for you not to come and--
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.000]   Could have been all the pink hats that were the giveaway.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]   Well, yeah, no, but on Twitter, you're seeing statements
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.360]   from people who were just literally just traveling back.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.280]   And they're being asked again for social media logins
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.360]   or for their purpose-- Really bothersome.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.720]   --for their political affiliation.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.720]   Or what do you think--
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.880]   And we know this is being asked frequently
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.840]   by Customs and Border Patrol in the United States,
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.000]   what do you think of President Trump?
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.640]   And I find that highly offensive.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.400]   Highly offensive.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:50.800]   They apparently no longer work for us.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.040]   They work for President Trump.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.880]   So I wouldn't blame you, frankly, Renee.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.160]   Well, and the thing to do, by the way,
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.400]   if you're thinking about that process,
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.320]   is something we used to do a lot in places
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.760]   that we were concerned about our cameras,
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.920]   is we had a safe tape.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.680]   You know that you'd always put into your camera.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.080]   So the tape was like--
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:13.160]   Oh, shakers, pictures of the butcher gardens.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:13.800]   Yeah, so--
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:14.920]   And then you do whatever you're going to do,
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.000]   but you never traveled with anything other than the safe tape
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:18.680]   in there.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:21.240]   Well-- In the same way, you can build--
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.920]   Build a little profile in Facebook, build a little Twitter
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.920]   thing, build a little whatever when they ask for that.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:26.920]   Have some fake accounts.
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.280]   You just have a fake account that you just showed them.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.360]   What did you say I don't have a Twitter account?
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.760]   I know, but I mean, the fact that I'd have to do "Opsect"
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.400]   is that it's amazing.
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.240]   Yeah, it's not good.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.240]   I think it's fun.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.240]   It's not good.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:38.240]   It's just an opportunity.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.200]   Is it--
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:39.680]   Playing.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.640]   Was it bad before, Renee?
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.440]   I mean, I've always had a little trouble getting into Canada,
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.000]   but that was because I was going there to work,
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.880]   and they don't--
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.640]   Yeah, so yeah.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.280]   So there's-- you have to be very clear.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.120]   Whether you're going to Canada or the US,
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.680]   you have to be very clear about work things,
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.000]   because they don't like the idea--
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.840]   like no country like said, people coming in just
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.320]   saying they're willing nilly.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.560]   So you state your purpose.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:01.320]   I've never had a problem with that.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:04.880]   But again, uncertainty is stressful.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.680]   And just to be fair, a lot of that stuff
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.160]   about being stopped at the border
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.360]   is saying that if someone seems to be--
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:17.280]   might be a Muslim, we want to see your social media accounts.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:18.040]   We want to see this.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:20.000]   That actually predates Trump.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.920]   This customs have been doing that, I think,
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.240]   in the Canadian border for--
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:24.320]   Well, that's what I was asking Renee
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.720]   if that's what you've been experiencing.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:30.600]   The only thing I've ever had was during, I think, Bush 1.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.040]   They would ask a lot about whether you're
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:33.640]   going to work in the US if you had anything to do
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.240]   with computers, just anything to do with the computer industry.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.840]   Are you coming to work in the US?
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:38.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:42.440]   And I had an office in Pasadena and San Francisco back then.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.240]   So the answer was yes, but I got booted into extra security
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.800]   over and over again with that.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.520]   My wife's African-American, and if she wore a head wrap,
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:53.640]   she was guaranteed that she'd be searched at the airport.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.480]   Like every--
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.560]   For me, it was facial time.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.520]   I had facial-- if I hadn't shaved, I would get enhanced security.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:01.120]   Well, we don't want you Canadians here anyway.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.440]   Stay home.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.440]   Rock taking Bieber back.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440]   We're sorry.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:04.960]   We're sorry.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.480]   Don't worry.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:05.960]   Don't worry.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.480]   We need your makeup.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:06.960]   Don't worry.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:08.680]   We're a softwood lumba tic-tac-tac.
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.440]   We're coming.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.920]   We're coming.
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.000]   Yeah, we're just going to go up there.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.280]   You'll notice that we're not building a wall in the north,
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.240]   because that wouldn't give us our--
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.440]   We've seen you guys try to drive on ice.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.920]   I do wonder if all of this wall rhetoric
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:25.200]   has anything to do with Game of Thrones and the wall.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.000]   I mean, I just wonder if people saw that and go,
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.200]   hey, that's a great idea.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.200]   We don't have white walkers, but there's Mexicans.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.680]   So good ideas.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.160]   No matter how disappointed I might be with Trump
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.480]   at any moment, I don't want to see him walking naked,
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.200]   even if you're saying shame.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:40.440]   Say, like, oh, just go.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.960]   No, no, no, we won't do that.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.000]   I promise you.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.640]   That won't happen.
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:46.960]   Hey, thank you, Renee, for being here.
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:47.800]   Great to see you.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.880]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey, for making the time to visit us,
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.800]   to warm a seat here in the studio.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.520]   Same with you, Andy Inako.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.880]   It's so great having you in studio.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:56.560]   This is a treasure.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.760]   And I'm just talking about the free beverages.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:02.200]   If you didn't see Andy's stint on the new screensavers
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.200]   on Saturday, tune in.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.720]   We talked about a lot of stuff, including cameras and things.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.120]   And next week, we're going to show what's in your bag.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.440]   We'll finally be revealed, the contents of Andy's bag.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:15.120]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Monday-- sorry, Tuesday, 11am
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.840]   Pacific, 2pm Eastern time.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:20.280]   1900 UTC, if you want to stop by and say hi,
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:23.360]   join us in the chat room to irc.twit.tv.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.800]   It's got a little quiet in there now
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.400]   that we've chased all the Republicans out.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.920]   So you're welcome.
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:29.200]   We'd love to have you in there.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:30.160]   You can all--
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:30.840]   It's a kidding.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.200]   kidding.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:31.680]   It's a joke.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.880]   It's a joke.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.240]   It's a joke.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.560]   If you can't watch live, we do have on-demand audio and video
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.200]   after the fact.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.400]   Twit.tv/mbw.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:45.240]   You'll also find it wherever you find your favorite podcasts,
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:50.200]   including iTunes, Stitcher Slacker, the apps.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:51.800]   There are plenty of them all over the place.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:52.800]   Thanks for being here.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.880]   I'm sorry to say you got to get back to work though now
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.920]   because, in the words of Alex Lindsey,
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.200]   I think you invented this.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:00.240]   Break time is over.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:03.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:11.440]   (upbeat music)
