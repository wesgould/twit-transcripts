[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000]   Is there such a thing?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Apple's acquisition of Prime Sense, the creators of the Kinect,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   but might they be using it for?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And why?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Somebody bought a $977,000 Mac Pro.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break with...
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Net Cass, you love.

[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Alex Lindsey is here.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Very nice to see you, sir.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Good to be here.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Where have you come from to us?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   From Vegas and DC and New York.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Oh, practically local.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Yeah, I'm here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'm here all week.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Nice to have you.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   He's here all week.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   LA next week.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Also with us, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hi, Renee.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   How's it going, Leo?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Good to have you, Andy Inaco, from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And very special guest, Allison Sheridan from Nozilla Cast.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Hi, Allison.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Leo, how are you doing?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I'm very well.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I think that Podfeet is misspelled.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I don't think there's a P in between the D and F.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I like the Podfeet.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We didn't do a second sculpture.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   We didn't do a second sculpture.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Too many conan sense.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Right, sure.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   That domain.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Podfeet.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Hi, Allison.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I haven't been with you since, well, been with you.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That's not the right phrase.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But I haven't, we haven't hung out.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   There you go.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Since Australia a year ago.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's been a long time.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I have to see you again.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So today we talk about Apple news.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And there's not as usual a whole lot of Apple news.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Do we say that like almost every, except unless, unless there's an Apple announcement a week away, every week is the way there's known as.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's, it's, it's like a world of Warcraft.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   World of Warcraft.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It's like World of Warcraft.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's run run run run run run fight.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   This is like rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor announcement.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah, we got a good crowd here because it's the holiday.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We did.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's busy.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And so everybody decided to just thanks, spend Thanksgiving with us.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   They're all looking at me a scance now.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I think they heard there was going to be turkey, Leo.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's me.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I think by prime sense, the company that did connect for Xbox 360, an Israeli company that specializes in,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   what do you, 3D sensor technology, I guess for, for one of a better word, $360 million, according to sources.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   This was a story that was broken by an Israeli blog last summer.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And then everybody denied it and it got quiet.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And then it came out again a couple of weeks ago.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And finally it's confirmed now from Apple itself.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, they said.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We can confirm the deal with Apple further than this.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   We cannot comment.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So when this was a rumor last week, Leo, you guys talked a lot about the idea of using it for games and that kind of thing with the Apple TV and waving your arms and all this kind of stuff.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But I had another thought, is it possible what they're going towards is places where you can't do touch like on a watch?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So the targets are just going to be too darn small on a watch to do anything.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   What if that's where they're going to do gestures because you can't actually touch it?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It goes smaller, not bigger.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I mean, technically it might be challenging.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The connect sensors is because it's a watch right now.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Oh, it is.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   They said they were making small chips.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But they could, in theory, make it, I'm sure they can do anything.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Go ahead.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I do think that we're going to find it in a non-obvious place.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I don't think they're going to use it the way that Microsoft uses connect.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I mean, it's just another that we could fill like another episode of another show just talking about interesting ideas that comes from my watch.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   When I think about putting a motion, a gesture controller like that on the watch, what I worry about is, yeah, but you're also, your sleeve is going to occasionally be brushing over it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Sometimes you're going to be moving it across objects without intending to.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   This is hard.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It starts playing music for you.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It was also some interesting stuff from MacRumors and Jessica Lesson now about how the technology behind it can be used for more than just connect stuff, like 3D model recognition, indoor mapping, all sorts of digital input stuff on that side that Apple could use to help with their C3 technologies, mapping stuff with indoor mapping, just beyond recognizing people in motions.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Just really interesting.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Just having a head count on the number of people inside of room would be very, very valuable.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I can also imagine that it might merely be an acquire in the sense that they just want these really smart Israeli engineers working on stuff for them.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It sounds like they're doing a lot of different things.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Connect, the new Connect, an Xbox One does not use Prime Sense's technology, and it's actually about 100,000 times better.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You don't have to get way far away from it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's really impressive. It does very good face recognition.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You walk in the room, it knows you're there, puts a little bubble on there.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It knows how to go.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah, up to six people it could recognize all of this the original Connect did not do, but that does, which is not to say that Prime Sense's technology is not able to do it.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It's just that Microsoft probably sensing this was about to happen decided to do their own in-house stuff.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And it'd be nice because Sirius made the microphone on Apple products so much more useful.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It'd be nice that the eyesight cameras were so much more useful, whether that is gaming or not.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Or just like Andy said, knowing more about us and our environment.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   There's a whole bunch of stuff you could do to make a smart camera system.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   One of the things if you look at some of the augmented displays that we've seen so far, those are mostly based on the accelerometer and trying to figure that out.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And you'll notice that there is some slippage.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So if you're moving around an augmented reality and you're kind of looking at stuff, there's a couple different ways of solving that.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   One is to do track points that are in the scene, but having the Connect's type technology would allow you to probably,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   maybe not two cameras, but taking the technology that they have, allow you to lock that a little bit tighter.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So that things that look like they're stuck in the real world, augmented on you through your phone could really stick to it.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And those are some of the things I think might be interesting as well.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   They do so.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I mean, really what they're doing is cameras that sense the world.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So they, for instance, they sell a product through iRobot called Ava that is used for healthcare.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So, I mean, this is really kind of a more sophisticated company than they do body metrics.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I'm wondering.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Is that an essential play?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Apple might be interested in as a body metric.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They do stuff for mobile with Qualcomm.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   The Capri sensor is very small.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So really what they say is the idea is to give devices the gift of sight.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And I could see lots of applications from Apple's point of view and the iPhone as well as the watch or TV.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I really do think that the next wave of multitouch was the big deal over the past five years.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I think the next really big deal over the next five years is going to be context awareness.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Just understanding that we don't, we're not going to have one static piece of software that the user now has to switch through to communicate to the device.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Oh, well, now I'm in the car, now I'm inside.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Turn that down.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Grandma?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Hello?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I'm here, Andy.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I'm working today.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So this is something called view foria that gives it is an augmented reality.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   This is we're looking through a tablet at stuff.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So there you go.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And this is this is prime.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   This is prime sense.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Yeah, this is what I was talking about.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   So being able to lock everything truly to the to the environment and not have it slip and or not have it slip nearly as much.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I think to make your coffee table into the game of thrones opening theme would be great.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Well, also, also you think about if you when you look at a demo like this, imagine that you don't even have to look at that screen.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Imagine that the computer just simply understands that you've got you've got a pencil on your desk that you just happen to have that by simply moving that pencil for one place to another you're communicating something to the device about what you want to do.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Right.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Or just by turn or just by turning on a lamp or moving a lamp or moving your keyboard closer to yourself and understands that he's okay.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He's now he's now he's now in a creating mode.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He's not in the watching mode right now.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   One also imagine going to a Greek ruin or a Roman ruins and being able to see what it what it looked like right through an iPad instead of what you're standing in.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   That's very cool.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   That's nice.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But is that worth putting another $8 component inside an already like cost margin device.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It depends on how many options how many places you could use it.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Yeah, see, I don't see Apple's I'm this is just conjecture my part.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I don't see Apple is doing that sort of thing where they're going to put a put a new component into a device and then hope that it gets built out into the world and they get enough partners that they actually do it.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I mean, we've seen a past book is a great tool.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And maybe we all kind of hope that by now it will be possible to sway the iPhone at anything at any retail outlet and be using that as your as your wallet.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And there's still plenty of places where you can use past book, but it's not by square is a lot more popular than than past book right now.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I just so I just don't see I can easily see it being used as a way of making everyday objects inside your house or on your desktop into parts of a user interface because there's all kinds of really cool ideas you can do.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You can use with that.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Imagine being able to simply pick up a pencil any pencil you want any pad of paper you want and draw and because this device can track the point of this of this device and maybe even sense the movement of how tightly you're gripping this this stylist and how tightly you're doing it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Not only are you actually really drawing with real paints on real canvas, but you're also making a digital copy of it on your computer about five feet away.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   That's the sort of stuff that I could see Apple doing.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Andy that context to where thing needs to go both ways though is I need to be contextually aware of where did that stuff go.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You know like if you start talking about watching TV right now where you you know there's a show you watch, but you can't figure out what channel it's on what device it's on which remote you're supposed to use.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So if I can draw with a pencil and it can sense it.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I also have to be contextually where as a human where did all that data go where did it end up is that one in Dropbox or Skydriver.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   You know all those things are still getting pretty mixed up in my head.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Here's the PrimeSense TV demo they do this and we should point out that that augmented reality was actually a demonstration of a Qualcomm chip set called Keforia that uses PrimeSense technology.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I don't know what this couple are actually doing.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   People are going to be typing on a real QWERTY keyboard on the screen by holding up their fingers and doing this.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Actually the Connect in the Xbox One the Connect does a lot of this for instance when you're doing a Skype on the Xbox One the Connect will recognize faces when somebody starts talking it will zoom in on that face.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   You can zoom in on that face using digital zoom stuff like that.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I mean just what it's doing is making the hardware aware of the real world and I think that that is very useful.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And then if there's an Apple TV this would be a useful way to interface to it.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I mean I talk to the Connect a lot on the Xbox One.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I'm watching a show I could say Xbox Pause it pauses it.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I could say Xbox Rewind.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Let's get any interface out of the way.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Yeah that's very interesting.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   You can also do things like instead of having a camera lens on a device probably a desktop device or a TV mounted device.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Instead of having the lens actually pointing directly at the speaker it's actually pointed at like a bubble of mirror.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And so dynamically the CPU can then sort of unwrap that image so that it seems as though the camera is pointing at the whatever speaker is speaking or whatever is making the most noise or the most movement.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I don't know exactly how Apple would use this sort of sensor.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So much of the cool cool stuff that's happening in mobile devices right now doesn't have so much to do with the now it's got an 800 DPI identity display.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It's not even so much the experience of the cameras the CPUs.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It's the idea of let's give this device either through software or through sensor connections a way to figure out how you're using this phone.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   We're not going to light up the screen.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   We're not going to force you to light up the screen.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   We're going to figure out that okay this phone has just been suffered experienced an upward movement and then an exposure to light and now the screen is being turned.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I'm guessing the user has just taken this device out of the pocket.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So I'm going to get this phone ready for whatever he wants to whatever he wants to see on that screen.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Those are the sort of and now that there are other platforms there are alternate home pages that try to figure out.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Okay every every single time it's been it's been eight o'clock at night on a on a Thursday.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   This user has wanted to get access to his his Roku app for controlling because he seems to watch a lot of TV between eight and 10 PM on a Thursday.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So when this device is lit up on a Thursday night at around that time, I'm not going to automatically launch the Roku app, but I'm going to make sure that that Roku app is very, very easy to get to and not buried three screens in.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   That sort of stuff is completely user facing. It's not it's not a subtle point.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It's not a forward thinking thing. It's the oh, that's the feature I wanted right the moment I wanted it.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Why doesn't this other phone do that?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It only took nine years, but Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is coming out on the iOS.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Awesome.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Awesome.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I just thought we mentioned that.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It's made for iPhone controller support.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Well, yeah, what is this? M fee controller.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Yeah, made for iPhone controller made for iPhone MFI.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   I feel like I'm only stealing cards and shooting people in the face on a fourth grade level and everybody else is at the collegiate level now.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   My development has been slow, so left back by iOS.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's a PlayStation two game from 2004.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   People are going bananas about it. It's going like Android iOS and Windows phone.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Yeah, that's exciting.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I don't usually pay attention to patents because often apples patents don't reflect with something they plan to make, but maybe something defensive or they don't want others to make.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   But they really they set a 300 I'm sorry, 610 page document to the world intellectual property organization whitebows database not to the USPTO for patent on touch related technologies.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   This is for the touch ID the fingerprint sensor button using it as a trackpad for sensing as the world's and ridges of your thumb or finger move over it to use it as a trackpad.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I think it's really cool.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Isn't that interesting? Yeah.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Yeah, that starts to get crazy because it knows all these other positions of your thumb to your finger as you've taught it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You can get RSI at a whole new level.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Also, Pat and the idea of using touch ID from the display not a separate button.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Yeah, that's important as the screens get bigger and the room around them for buttons.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Trust it is up here.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So I have so many times.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   That's because it's sorry.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Sorry.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I really didn't understand that one.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   So what they said was you could use your finger as a fingerprint control on the screen.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Well, if they could have done it on the screen all along, what did they have to have that fancy touch ID sensor for?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Pat doesn't mean they can do it.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Pat and the thought of it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   They thought of it.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Isn't it really cool?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   The Apple patents is that quite often they'll patent so many things because they don't want you to know what they're actually working on.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   They patent 600 things.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It's impossible to find out which one is actually what they're doing.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   This does point back, though, to an earlier Apple patent that did allow the screen to look at you, a two-way screen technology.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   One, a lot of times you're...
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's almost anything you can think of because if you're even in that world that it might...
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   That it might occur in, you want to make sure that no one else is getting that patent.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Speaking of patents, I'm very sad to report new egg, which decided that it wanted to defend cryptography patent against a patent troll TQP lost in court yesterday, sad to say, and has to pay $2.3 million.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   There it is, the historic Harrison County Courthouse in Marshall, Texas, where a jury, despite the fact that they even heard from...
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Whichfield Diffie, the inventor of public key cryptography, didn't believe that it was in fact invented before this little company TQP.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Why don't people understand that Marshall, Texas, is really the center of technology research and the jury of your peers is really going to know an enormous amount about...
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   This is why patent tooling works.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   That's where the invisibility cloak was invented.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   If you've got a tour of the high-tech facilities that you can't see there, oh boy.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Your head would spin, sir.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It took three hours to decide that TQP's patent, which is tied to a failed modem business that was acquired by a patent troll, they've actually got more than $45 million in licensing fees up to now based on this.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They say their patent covers SSL.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I'm thinking that anybody uses SSL.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   I think we have to figure out how to get Google+ involved because they were so good at getting rid of all the trolls and YouTube that now we can just simply apply it to patents.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   It would work really well.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's just really sad.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   What I'm amazed by is that this isn't... I guess it's slowly moving to the surface.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   As far as people realizing how absolutely idiotic this is.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   The fact that someone had a failed business with a modem that somehow...
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I own SSL now.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   If you say you own SSL, this guy's the limit because every website in the world that wants to do secure transactions has to use SSL.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   He clearly did not invent public key cryptography, but apparently the jury was not convinced.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And they would know.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And of course, eight good and true jurors of our peers.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Eight people who could spare the time in Marshall, Texas.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Eight angry Texans.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Oh, it's red.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Oh, this is the Johnny I've read one of a kind, Mac Pro.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Did you get it Leo?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Was it you're the $977,000?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   It was a deal.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I wish I'd bid less than a million.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   They thought it'd go for $40,000 to $60,000.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And I think about the one of a kind like a design by Johnny.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I've that one went for a little bit more.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I think $1.9 million dollars.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   $1.45.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   $1.4?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   With or without?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I'm looking at before the buyer's premium.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   $1.8 million is the quote here.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Gold, Apple, Earpods, solid gold, rose gold, better than regular gold.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   $461,000.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   A one of a kind aluminum desk designed by I've and Mark Newsom sold for.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   $1.68 million.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Now that's good.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   All of this means they raised $26 million for product red to end AIDS in Africa.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So it's a good cause.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And I think that's one of the reasons he was.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Please went for so much.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I had a great interview on.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I had a interview on.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   I had a interview on.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I didn't see a Charlie Rose interview.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   That was interesting.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Yeah, worthwhile.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Just for Johnny, Johnny, I did not give interviews.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And also he's in charge of so much of Apple's direction and his view on objects and their
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   importance and what the direction he wants to go with them I think is fascinating no
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   matter what he's talking about.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.560]   We had Lander Connie on the show last week.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.200]   He wrote the book on Johnny Ive that just came out that really sounds fabulous.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.880]   He said even couldn't get even though he knew friends of friends and so forth could
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.800]   not get an interview with Johnny Ive.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.600]   But so Charlie Rose got the big interview.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   Because he is Charlie Rose.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   He's Charlie Rose.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   No, he's a personality.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.680]   And they really wanted to get that money that those bids up on the saw that he's auctioned.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.360]   So that was, I know that little notification that came up on screen when you were just
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.320]   looking at that annoying notification.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.160]   Yeah, but you just said allow to let them send you notifications.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.840]   I know you saw me do that, did you?
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.920]   I should just say don't allow, but maybe there's an important nine to five Mac notification
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.960]   that I would want to see in my I turn off notifications when I'm using the computer.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   See I do not disturb on.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.160]   You could have won the bit Leo if you only had notification.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.600]   The irony of that is they can't give you a notification, but they can give you a
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   pop up that says, do you want notifications?
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.480]   You would not disturb his on.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   Thanks.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   Thank you.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.440]   I was curious to know about the about that red Mac Pro though.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.520]   So they that it wasn't like just a show.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   They had an actual work.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.480]   They had an actual one of those on display of Sotheby's.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   Did it work?
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   I want.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   Well, then they didn't boot it up.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.720]   But I'm wondering if the actual device is going to be put in a box and sent to that person.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.960]   And if that person is going to have access to prerelease firmware, prerelease, whatever,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.360]   or if it goes back to Cupertino, they basically do a do a course swap to and they make sure
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   that this person has doesn't have anything that that should not have been leaving a Cupertino
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   in the first place.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.000]   That's available to anybody else.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.120]   I doubt very much they got to take it home from the auction room.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.960]   The interesting thing is we talked about the Mac Pro being bent into shape last week.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   They like a camera.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.360]   They said that they designed that to be mass produced.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.760]   Everything about that they thought about it and they made it.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.240]   But in order to make value because he said like design is meant for everybody.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.840]   So the only way to make it valuable was to make it one of a kind.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.400]   So instead of these being mass produced, it's only ever going to be one of them.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.880]   But they could be mass produced.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.440]   They wanted to make a real like a real designed object.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.240]   So the auction, I should be clear.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:14.080]   The auction raised 13 million, but Bill Gates matched it, which is pretty freaking amazing.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.440]   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation doubled the amount to 26.2 million to go to the global
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.080]   fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   So that, you know, Bill Gates deserves a pretty big group of attacks.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   Absolutely.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.760]   He could, he should get one of each too.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   You're one of our guys.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   Just come on.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.600]   Hey, Bill, we've decided you get a red Mac Pro and you get a red Mac Pro.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.280]   His wife would let him use it.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.320]   No, Chris is actually recovering from malaria.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.920]   By the way, we didn't talk about that.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.800]   So Chris, who is a good friend at Pixelcore member, went to Rwanda, right to work there.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   He was even there.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   He said I'm going to move there.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   He loved it so much.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.080]   And we think, I mean, I have to talk to him a little bit more about it, but we think that
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.840]   it would, he actually would have been better off if he had just been in Rwanda when he
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   got it because he came back to the United States and was, you know, missed.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.840]   They didn't know it was malaria.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.520]   It was mistreated.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:09.400]   And so, so yeah, malaria is, you know, I got a very mild version of it, which was still
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   horrible.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   You have malaria?
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   Oh, I'm a couple years ago.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   And it's not catching, is it?
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   No, it doesn't catch.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   So, so if I'm a ski don't bit you and then bit me when I get it?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   No.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   Oh, no, not anymore.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   So anyway, not anymore.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   Oh, while I.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   Isn't it always in you?
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   I don't think so.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   Yes, it's always in you.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   So, mosquito bit me and then bit you.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   Never get cured for more.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   I'm telling you that once mosquito bites me, I kill it.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   So anyways.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.200]   You should put it in the jar and say that just took care of us.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   Just out of spite.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.600]   Yeah, I'm pretty much like when a dog bites you don't want it to go.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.760]   I told you after I got, after I got, after I got malaria, I came back and I got, I got
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760]   one of those bugs.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.000]   Zappers, I got two of them from my backyard.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Yeah, mosquitoes are not good.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.600]   I turn them on and I'm having a barbecue.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   You hear the shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.360]   And someone, someone came over and he goes, "Did you know that 70% of the bugs that you
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.360]   kill with that are not mosquitoes?"
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.360]   Who cares?
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   Yeah, but 30% of them are.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   What else do you kill him?
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   He's not real damage.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.200]   I was like, "You're not killing small marsupials."
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   And the rest of them are bugs.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   They're all bugs.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   You know, so anyway.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   You know what?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.040]   Probably not spiders and those are the ones you want because they kill the mosquitoes.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.640]   No, actually, you know what's funny is, is that, well, what's funny is I have spiders
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.880]   around my house and I actually don't, they have to really get in my way before I'll take
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.640]   them out because my wife was like, "Are you going to clean out all those spider webs?"
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.440]   And I'm like, "No, because they're catching the mosquitoes."
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   That's right.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.840]   You know, you definitely become very aware of mosquitoes when you, uh, so Chris, Chris
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.120]   apparently got very sick.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   He almost died.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   He almost died.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.320]   And a lot of that was, to be fair, it was mistreatment.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   It wasn't just that he had malaria.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   How do you ever want it?
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   They would have recognized it immediately.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   You would have treated him correctly and you're having to.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.080]   You know, and so instead he, but he spent two years and two weeks in intensive care.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   Oh my God.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.480]   I mean, I've, uh, is kidney, kidney operations are now almost back to normal, but, but he
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   was down to five per se.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.480]   So he's, he's good at it.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   And, um, yeah.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.840]   And, and so he, he is going to fully recover, but it was, it's a, it's a, it is a big deal.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.240]   I mean, so we just face to face with, um, you know, what it, what it does.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.800]   It's pretty, uh, and it's, you know, it's something that is solvable.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.600]   I think that's the other thing when we look at a lot of the, um, things that are going
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   on.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   It can be.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   You know, we had malaria.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.160]   I mean, the CDC is in Atlanta because we got rid of malaria.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.480]   You know, we mostly do it with DDT, but, but the, um, uh, but the main thing is you have
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   to kill the vector.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.800]   So if you look at like Rwanda is, is putting out another two and a half million, two point
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.600]   three million nets.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.320]   Um, a lot of it's making sure that people don't get bit, you know, when people don't
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.920]   get bit, the vector gets, you know, is planted and, um, and the hard part is of course, in
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.760]   Africa is you have to get all the countries doing it.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.720]   You know, and so in 2010, according to the World Health Organization, one, as many as
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.800]   1.2 million people died of malaria.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   Yep.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.760]   I mean, it is not a trivial disease.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.640]   That's when Bill Gates released the jar of mosquitoes at the TED conference, got a lot
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   of attention.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   Right.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.200]   Uh, but what he was saying is these are the problem.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.160]   I don't think they were a malarial mosquito.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.600]   I think he's probably pretty careful of that.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   That would have been a big moment.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   They were specially.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.640]   The thing is, is when you think about the, about, you know, the number of people dies,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.120]   it's 200, 200 million.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   So it's, it's 0.5% of the people that get malaria actually die from it because there's
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.880]   a couple of different strand, you know, strains of it.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.200]   Although there are treatment resistant malarial strands now.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   Exactly.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.800]   And there are definitely certain strains of this that are particularly bad.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.400]   So it's, one of the most compelling speeches I ever saw at All Things D was Melinda Gates
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.480]   was talking about how everybody would beg bill for money.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.920]   Like he carried a letter in his wallet for three months from a guy who wanted him to
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.480]   buy a liver for his son.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.200]   You know, clearly he could buy a liver for the guy's son out of what he pulled out of
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.920]   his sea cushions.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.300]   But she said it drove him nuts because he couldn't figure out how to spend his money.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.440]   So what they figured out finally to do was if they just treated this like a business,
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.400]   if they, they, they sat down and they wrote down all of the diseases in order from top
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.560]   to bottom of what kills the most people.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.340]   And they said, okay, well, malaria, if we get rid of malaria, then we can move all of
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.180]   that money to the next disease down because once you get rid of it, you've gotten rid
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.180]   of it.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.300]   It's not like it would crop back up again.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.500]   As long as nobody hasn't had it in like two years, it's gone.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.460]   So it was just a really interesting way.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.660]   He described how they looked at the problem of, of what diseases to try to cure and what
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.900]   to do with the money.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.260]   And it was, it was just kind of a neat description she gave.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:24.660]   Well, and I think this, this is a good juxtaposition here of, of, of someone who's skilled at
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.700]   business and how a lot of our programs end up getting built.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.620]   And you know, a lot of the programs that are built in Africa, you know, are built by people
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.260]   who are really good at writing proposals and not necessarily, you know, business people.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.820]   And, you know, and we've seen that the same challenge, you know, for instance, like with
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.820]   the website for healthcare, you know, is written by, you know, run by people who are
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.980]   really good at writing proposals, you know, and, and so I think that what's challenging
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.500]   is always figuring out actually how to get it done.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.100]   And I think that that is, and there's a lot of good ideas that get blunted because people
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.260]   don't know how to actually do them.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.140]   And I think that this is one of the things, and you see the gates when you're in Africa,
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.380]   you see efforts from the Gates Foundation everywhere, you know, I mean, they're very,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.340]   they're everywhere and they're, but they're very, very focused on, on output.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   So anyway, I don't know how that relates to Macintoshes.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.660]   Well, no, it's important to get it out.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.860]   But yeah, it's, it's, it's doesn't really relate to Macintoshes either.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.140]   It's also another sad story.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:23.260]   You've heard me talk about the steampunk laptop that I had made from Data Manser Richard
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.260]   Nagy.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.580]   It took him a couple of years to make made it by hand.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.820]   And it's really quite a beautiful work of art.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.540]   I'm sad to say Nagy passed away.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.980]   In a car accident in California, according to Corey Doctorow at Boing Boing.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.220]   He was a very well-known steampunk artisan.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:46.420]   In fact, if you look at the picture on Boing Boing of the steampunk computer with that
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:53.580]   has turning wheels and knobs and has Victrola speakers for the, the audio and it looks like
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.140]   a telephone.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.660]   The funny thing is all of this stuff had real stuff inside it.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:04.700]   It's my, my steampunk laptop is running a Windows 7 machine inside this handcrafted wood and,
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.700]   and stained glass and everything.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:14.100]   And so very sad to hear that Richard, a naked Data Manser, according to Corey Doctorow has
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.820]   passed away, sad story.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.820]   Let us take a break.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.460]   When we come back, I want to, I want, there's proof.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.820]   I've known it all along.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.620]   Mike Elgin writing for the Cult of Mac says, yes, Apple does maintain a press.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.180]   Blacklist, a people in the media who are shunned and ignored for disloyalty.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.220]   Leo, blacklisted reporters, editorialists and media personalities are denied access to
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.100]   information, products and events.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.300]   And once you're on the list says, Mike, it's almost impossible to get off.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.420]   He says he's been on it for more than a decade.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.700]   I've only been on it for three years.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.340]   So that's not bad.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.500]   I don't know that I'm on the list, but that's what I was wondering reading that is how
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.820]   does Mike know he's on that list and how does he know there is a list?
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.820]   We got an article.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.620]   I mean, he wrote the article that makes it.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.620]   Oh, he wrote the article.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.620]   He wrote the book.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.620]   I got it.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.620]   I got it.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.620]   Self-fulfilling.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.620]   We've heard, I mean, we've heard lots of...
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.020]   He said right there using a Windows phone and I think Andy still has access, right?
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.220]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.940]   I read the whole article.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:21.700]   I mean, it really, I really think that that's being blown out of proportion.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.980]   I'm sure that every company, whenever they have a new product or new thing that they
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.460]   want to get coverage on, they have an idea inside their heads of who they absolutely
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.660]   want to work with.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.060]   I'm sure there's one or two that...
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.220]   This is true for every single company of who they maybe are now inclined to work with
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   again.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:46.100]   I think mostly it comes down to easy to track metrics like what is this person's audience?
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.460]   Is it a localized audience?
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.020]   Is it an international audience?
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.260]   What kind of coverage have they written in the past?
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.700]   Is this person a bozo?
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.860]   Does this person absolutely not get us?
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.620]   On the best day of our lives, will the best thing we ever make, will they get anything
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.580]   that we do?
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.220]   I just don't think that...
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:12.020]   I don't think that any company feels as though they can control an individual writer by controlling
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.420]   access to the company.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.700]   I think the one thing that you can do above everything else is to simply be a professional.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.100]   Last year, I've wrote a couple of things about Apple that I'm sure they weren't very
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.260]   happy with.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.220]   My relationship with the people I know at Apple remained exactly the same.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.660]   As usual, at times I'm invited to stuff and times I'm not invited to stuff.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.300]   At times I get stuff early, sometimes I don't.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.580]   If I let that affect in any way, shape, or form how I do my job, I wouldn't be doing
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.580]   my job.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.580]   You're a beautiful server.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.580]   I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's...
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.780]   You know, they're well thought out and fact-based.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.540]   I think that stands on its own.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.540]   Thank you.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.340]   I mean, that's really the point.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.660]   If you're a professional, you'll get the job done no matter what help you get or what
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.700]   help you don't get.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:03.380]   I just don't think that it's in any way productive to try to work out that, "Oh, well, there's
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:07.580]   a blacklist and I'm on it in the larger..."
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.060]   Any one individual will think, "Oh, well, I'm on the blacklist.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.860]   That's why I'm not getting my emails responded to."
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.860]   Someone else saying, "Well, geez, I don't know why I'm not getting my emails responded
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:16.860]   to.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.860]   I don't know why I'm talking about things about Apple."
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:26.040]   Again, the thing is, until any company decides to say, "Here's the list of everybody that
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.100]   we like and everybody that we don't like and all the reasons why we are going to help
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.020]   some people and why we're not going to help some other people, all you're doing is engaging
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.100]   in conjecture and that's just absolutely pointless.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.900]   I know a lot of PR people feel the same way about us.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.460]   I mean, I get hundreds, if not thousands of PR emails a week and I don't have the opportunity
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.460]   to answer half of them.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.460]   I don't know exactly anything.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.460]   I'm sure they think there's a list.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.460]   Yeah, I'm sure they think that there's a lot of people.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460]   All on my list.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.580]   Yeah, I mean, I agree with Andy.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.060]   I don't, whether there's a blacklist or not, and Mike doesn't effectively prove that there
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.580]   is a blacklist, although I would imagine there is.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.780]   It shouldn't affect anybody's willingness to do their job pro or con and certainly doesn't
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.780]   affect mine.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:12.620]   His point is well taken that, for instance, he presumes, doesn't prove that when the New
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:18.620]   York Times ran those stories, arguably hit pieces on Apple about the factories, Apple
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.020]   gave a big scoop to the Wall Street Journal very shortly after and gave him Tim Cook.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.860]   I have to admit that if I was running a company on someone, you know, do that.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.860]   Don't have to do that.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.260]   It's not.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.300]   But if you, for instance, if you give product review loners to come to people who you know
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.260]   will be positive, will you avoid people?
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.180]   I mean, of course you will.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.180]   Of course you could.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.140]   As a company that, of course you could and can, but the point of view of the public should
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.740]   be then right suspicious of coverage of that company.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.140]   For instance, and I'll, we'll take it out of the tech realm.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.300]   It's very well known that Beltway journalism has its risks because your sources are the
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.980]   members of Congress that you're covering and they can ice you, giving you no access, making
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.700]   it very difficult to do your job as a reporter inside Washington's Beltway.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:12.340]   So it's a very careful balancing act as a reporter that you have to do.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.020]   And I'll give you another example of a known blacklist, which is John C. Devorak.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   There was maintained at Microsoft for many years, an enemies list.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.780]   It was like a Nick Sony and enemies list and John happened to walk by the office and see
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.780]   it.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.300]   And he saw his name on it.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.740]   And it's an enemy.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.220]   He was probably really happy about it.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.220]   While he was in the building.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.220]   I love it.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.220]   He was in the building.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:39.020]   And it never really hurt him in terms of his ability to do his job.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.460]   The folks still got review units.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.940]   He's still got his devices.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.340]   If you're powerful enough, you will get review units.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.780]   And the thing is, is that I was a worked in PR for Sony Music a long time ago.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.980]   And my job was to get press for bands, for living color, Indigo Girls or whatever.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.940]   And you're not going to get access to people who don't.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.620]   Well, I mean, the thing is, we would shower on the guys.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.020]   I took my job with the tech guys out drinking.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:10.020]   And make sure that they got to see the bands and make sure they got backstage and make
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.500]   sure they did all those things.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.380]   They didn't put my guys in hot rotation.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.060]   And I'd put up with that for a couple of times.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.060]   Then after that, they're not getting backstage.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.060]   And they're not getting pre-releases.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.060]   They're not getting giveaways.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.700]   I have a whole bunch of people I got to take care of.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.700]   I'm not going to take care of them.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.340]   It's no accident, for instance, that Gizmodo has never been in an Apple event after they
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.580]   bought that stolen iPhone.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.580]   That's no secret.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.580]   The Leo's not been in an event after he's in the store.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.580]   I don't know.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.580]   You know, I truthfully--
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.500]   I have no idea whether I'm on a list or not.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.060]   And I know it doesn't really matter to me.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.060]   I probably wouldn't--
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.060]   You're just like joking about it.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.060]   But speaking to Apple, I like the joke about it.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.580]   But speaking to Apple, the only way that you can prove that there is no black list is
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.820]   for Leo to be at the next Apple event.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.140]   Well, there was a time when I was invited to every event.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.140]   And they sent me Little Christmas packages, which I felt ethically very challenged by,
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.620]   wrapped with ribbon and all the new iPods in it.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.460]   There was a time when I was on somebody's good side.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.380]   But I stopped taking loaners a long time ago for the most part by everything I needed.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.700]   And I can afford to do that.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.980]   I do feel sorry for a working journalist who cannot afford to do that, who's trying to
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.180]   cover Apple and doesn't get any support.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180]   But that--
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.500]   I think you sort of hit upon it.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.060]   I think when the complaint that some people will have is that when you really peel the
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.500]   onion and get to the very core of it, it's that--
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.220]   The 20x did not send me a free one of these for 30 days, and they did not send it to me
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   early.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.620]   Neither of these things will prevent you from writing about that product.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.260]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.980]   If you don't have it on-- if they didn't send you one and you have it available on release
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.620]   day, you're perfectly welcome to go buy one on your own.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.940]   If you can't buy one on your own, you probably know somebody who has access to one.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.660]   And if you don't have that, there are ways to get your hands on one that don't involve
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   theft.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:00.020]   The only thing that I don't-- the only thing I really don't like about these sort of conversations
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.700]   is that it comes down to a sense of entitlements that, "Hey, look, I have a big audience.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.900]   I should be getting a certain amount of treatment."
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.780]   Or, "Hey, you don't know who I am.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.420]   You should be helping me out as much as you possibly can."
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.460]   You know, unfortunately-- and this is a problem I have.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.820]   Any time I talk about it, that's what it ends up sounding like.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   I'm being peevish.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   I know.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.820]   And I don't mean to be peevish.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.900]   In fact, Mike says clearly, at the end of his article at the call to Mac, the technology
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.140]   presses far more independent and ethical than people generally give them credit for.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.860]   Yes, Apple has a blacklist.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.020]   And yes, you should know about it so you can be a better informed media consumer and consumer
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.340]   electronics customer.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.340]   But ultimately, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.900]   So he really agrees with what you're saying.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.820]   I think there's a lot of freedom in not being said.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.820]   I love it.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.820]   I don't talk to PR people.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.900]   I don't go to company events.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.740]   I don't take vendor meetings.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.100]   Because in the long run, it's better for me and my coverage not to have a relationship
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.100]   to companies.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   And so--
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.100]   Oh, I think--
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.100]   Go ahead.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.100]   It's not for me.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.020]   I mean, I really enjoy having a dialogue with the company that makes these things.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.340]   Because sometimes only when you're sitting in a room with somebody, and they are explaining
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.980]   to you why they built this thing, why they think this is important, why they went ahead
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.180]   with this product.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.460]   And especially if you're there in the room and you get to really look into their eyes
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.540]   and see, am I the 11th person that is going-- that is being read this script that they
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.540]   came up with?
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.940]   Or if I ask them questions that make them go off script, am I going to see the exact
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.340]   same amount of childlike pleasure?
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.460]   I still-- the key-- the apex has always been for me.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.540]   Steve Jobs was running the iPhone, and Steve Jobs was running the iPad.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.540]   You saw a guy who was like giddy with excitement.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.260]   Like he was unwrapping a gift for the entire world.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:44.180]   And so it's-- I don't necessarily believe that it's important to maintain a distance.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:50.300]   Because sometimes I will look at a product without benefit of the story around it and
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.540]   not get why someone was making this.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:58.740]   And it's not as though my opinions will be changed by hearing the engineers who came
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.620]   up with this certain feature or lobby for this or that.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.940]   But it's sometimes interesting to hear that backstory because that's a perspective that
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   you don't have.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.940]   So that's--
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:12.420]   >> I think that's so much more logical, Andy, than picturing them actually spending energy.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.460]   You know, oh, this guy in the list, you know, where we keep the list.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.660]   >> Yeah, I just can't picture a corporation like Apple doing that.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.660]   I can picture a media one.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.660]   >> Oh, I can't.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.660]   >> Oh, God.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.660]   Oh, you can also-- absolutely.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.660]   >> Absolutely.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.900]   You have-- they are-- look, they're humans.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.900]   They can be petty.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   >> I just agree.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   >> Oh, absolutely.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   They're homeless.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.900]   >> I disagree.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:38.660]   I really do think that it comes down to every single time I think it comes down to how many--
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:44.540]   if we've got eight copies of the new iPhone that we can give to people ahead of time,
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.860]   those are precious commodities.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.340]   What are-- it's not-- who do we like or who do we not like?
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.020]   It's what are our goals with these eight and only eight devices?
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:58.780]   >> I talk to more people about Macintosh products than anybody except for the rare few.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.620]   I do a radio show that's heard by a million people every weekend.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.300]   I do Mac break weekly.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.340]   And if Apple doesn't invite me to the event, it's not because I don't have a large and
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.940]   important pulpit.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.100]   It's because they don't like me.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.380]   It's very simple.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.140]   I'm not-- I don't mean to be peevish about it.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.140]   I'm not.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.140]   I don't care.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.140]   >> I don't think--
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.140]   >> But there is definitely a list and I'm on it.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.700]   If it weren't, why wouldn't they invite me?
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.260]   >> I don't think it comes down to like or not like.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.420]   I think it comes down to goals.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.420]   That's all.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.420]   >> Come on.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.420]   I talk to Andy.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.420]   >> Who is?
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.620]   >> Andy, I have a syndicated radio show that talks to two-- on 200 stations, talks to a
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.060]   million people every weekend about what products to buy.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.780]   And you think that that's not important, Apple.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.100]   More than USA today, more than Wall Street Journal, more than New York Times.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.580]   It should be if it's not, then they're not paying attention.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.140]   The argument that I'm making is with the word like.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.740]   You know, Apple is a company.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.220]   They are 10,000 people.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   They--
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.220]   >> Well, I'm merely saying--
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:59.060]   >> I'm merely saying that the reasonable business decision would be to curry favor with
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.540]   me, which they don't do.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.980]   And my suggestion is they don't do it.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   It's fine with me, by the way.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   I wouldn't take it.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.980]   It's fine with me.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.620]   But the reasonable reason is-- you know, there was very much of a cliff where I went
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.700]   from being favored to unfavored.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.420]   It was obvious to me.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.420]   I don't care about that.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.700]   I don't want to go to their events.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.460]   But the point is, I'm pointing out, there's no question in my mind.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.900]   It's obvious.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.980]   And it's not because of whether I talk to people or not, or whether I have an importance
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   to their business.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.380]   A prudent business decision would be to curry favor with one of the major mainstream tech
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.780]   reporters in the country, period, right?
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   They don't do John C. de Vorac either.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.380]   >> Again, my only difficulty is with like or not like, or whether they have--
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.300]   >> I'm not saying they don't like me.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   I don't know whether they like me.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.300]   I can't tell you that.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.940]   >> I'm saying-- I have no knowledge of the inner desires or workings of Apple.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.260]   I'm also saying that it's also not important to you or I that we know with their inner
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.260]   desire.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.260]   >> No, it's not important at all.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.260]   I get my same coverage.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.260]   >> Because--
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.260]   >> Because-- well, yeah, it's not only--
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:03.180]   >> But you can't tell me-- >> John Gruber has as much importance to Apple in the public eye.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.660]   I will tell you-- people have asked me about this.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.980]   I've given them the exact same answer.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:13.580]   The reason why they work so closely with Gruber is huge audience, not only that but
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   a huge international audience.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.580]   >> Oh, I'm much bigger audience.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.580]   >> He's a clever--
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.580]   >> He's not kidding me?
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.580]   >> Yes, he has--
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.580]   >> He has a special--
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.580]   >> He has a special audience.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.380]   >> He has credibility and also he gets Apple.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.580]   And that doesn't mean that if you don't get Apple, you're wrong.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   >> Oh, he gets Apple.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.980]   >> I'm saying-- his thinking-- I'm saying I believe that his way of thinking about what
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.380]   is the role of design, what is the role of hardware, what is the interaction between
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.220]   a company and its customers and a product and its customers are very much in sync with
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.220]   Apple.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:46.220]   So when Apple-- when people inside Apple read his stuff, they hear a kindred spirit speaking.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.060]   >> And they know he's not going to go off the ranch.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.060]   He's going--
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.060]   >> No, I know.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:56.740]   I think that-- again, I don't know of any thinking inside of Apple, but my guess would
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.620]   be that they know that if he went off the ranch would be because he felt very-- he felt
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.900]   very deliberately about it.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.300]   He would also-- he wouldn't do it accidentally.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.500]   He wouldn't do it carelessly.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.620]   And he would express his sentiments very, very closely.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.980]   That's a-- so all I'm saying is that what every single person who is not a bozo wants
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.060]   is for their own work to tell the story of what kind of professional they are.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.060]   And I think that if you--
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.060]   >> That's right.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.620]   >> I think that readers are very, very good at telling that this person-- gee, this person
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:30.900]   got a piece of hardware and he wrote a thousand words on this piece of hardware and 800 words
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.340]   or of it where how cool it was to get hardware from Apple.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.340]   This guy is a bozo.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.660]   I don't care what he's saying.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:42.020]   Also from the flip side, if you write 2,000 words on a certain laptop and you're saying
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.420]   that this is-- I won't identify the calmness.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   It wasn't me.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:52.220]   But it was like-- it's still like the hallmark of bad tech reporting for me that-- oh, here's
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.260]   the new titanium MacBook Powerbook, but it's okay, but you should buy it because Apple's
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.260]   going to go out of business.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.260]   It's like a thousand word review.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.860]   It's about 800 words talking about what you think is the death of the company.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.820]   Again, that's bozo behavior.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.380]   If you build up your own reputation, everything-- the ship will ride itself.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.620]   You will get safely into the port of your compsees.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.620]   >> That's great.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.620]   Nobody's saying that.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.300]   We're not even discussing that.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   That's not even the issue.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.380]   The issue is does Apple try to manipulate the press with a blacklist?
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.820]   >> I don't think so.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.820]   >> Okay.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.940]   >> Because I think that if they thought that they could manipulate this person that they
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.700]   know that this person is of little value to them.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.780]   They don't want-- they don't just want somebody to--
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   >> Oh!
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.740]   >> I'm right nicely into both of them.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.740]   I'm saying--
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   >> Really?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.540]   You think the presence of little value to them if they know that they can get a good
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.940]   story out of them?
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:40.940]   >> What's valuable-- okay.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.100]   It's easy-- I'm saying it's very, very easy to get a good story.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.980]   Again, if you walked into the Apple store, found somebody who knows how to operate Tumblr,
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.300]   say I'll give you this free MacBook Air if you write something about it, they'll get
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   a lot of good press about it.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.780]   They'll get a lot of good Tumblr posts about it.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.700]   What they want is, again, somebody with a large audience, someone with a reputation,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.060]   so that when that person decides to use that reputation as a spotlight, to swing it to
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:11.580]   this product, say, I want all of you people who read me or listen to me or watch me to
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.460]   take a look at this because I think it's important enough that you look at this because I'm
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.340]   interested in it as well.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.340]   That's what the value is.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.620]   There are very, very few high value people like that who can be manipulated because by the
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:29.100]   time you've developed that kind of a reputation, you're no longer dazzled by the idea, "Oh,
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.260]   well, I got a bar or a free Nexus 5 for two weeks.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.580]   This is awesome."
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:40.820]   That's what I mean when I'm saying that Apple wants a high value person to speak highly
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.460]   of their products, and those people are not the sort of people who are going to be swayed
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.740]   by the idea of getting something early.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:54.180]   So we wondered when the Mac Pro came out with 4K Thunderbolt display ports, why there was
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.580]   no 4K display because they hadn't gotten to it yet.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.820]   Perhaps, according to a Redditor who's done some digging, a display supplier overseas
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:11.260]   with ties to Apple is currently making 4K desktop displays designed for Thunderbolt.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:18.260]   It's AU Optronics, they've started making 27 and 32 inch panels.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:23.180]   You know, it's like, wait a minute, you get a little bigger and it turns into an Apple
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   TV.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.180]   Yeah, 3840 by 2160.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.180]   Just throw the port, please.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.620]   Adult diaper from Mr. LePorte.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.940]   Using DisplayPort signaling, which is the key, that's by the way something I learned, you
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:40.100]   can have Thunderbolt, you can have DisplayPort, but unless your Thunderbolt has DisplayPort,
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.300]   you can't put a display on your Thunderbolt port.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   That's very complicated.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.620]   I don't understand it myself.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.980]   But anyway, these do.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.900]   They made displays for the first iPad Mini.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.740]   They did not make the retina mini.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.780]   And there are no concrete reports about Apple doing a Thunderbolt.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.340]   4K display, I just feel like that's the other shoe that could drop when they announce the
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.340]   Mac Pro later.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.860]   Sometimes they'd assemble, right?
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.580]   I would be surprised if we do not see a 4K monitor with Final Cut Pro.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:10.580]   Because...
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:11.580]   You got to.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.060]   I just spent all weekend in Final Cut 10.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.140]   And I got to tell you, the screen's too small.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.620]   Not my laptop screen.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.140]   27 inches too small.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.140]   Yeah, it's too small.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.140]   No, it's too small.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.140]   No, 27 is fine.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.140]   I'm saying.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.140]   Oh, okay.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.140]   But smaller than...
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.420]   I really want 4K and I want a big screen and it would have been much nicer for what
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.420]   I was doing.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.620]   And here's another story from Kultimak.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.780]   I find hard to believe.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:38.060]   Apple's first foray into wearable computing, the eye hearing aid?
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.740]   Well, this is another patent, right?
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:49.380]   The Danish-based hearing aid company, the fourth largest hearing aid manufacturer in the world
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:55.180]   has been collaborating with Apple to make a device called the Lynx that would allow users
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.780]   to stream voice and music from their iOS devices.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.020]   So that to the hearing aid, to the 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:05.780]   Well, I think a more accurate view, a more accurate description of this would be an
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.780]   "B".
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:09.780]   I've got this little thing in my ear.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.220]   Oh, you mean this is not a hearing aid?
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.620]   It's an interoperable fold-back mechanism?
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   Yes.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.620]   No one knows what an IFB is.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.620]   What is an IFB?
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.620]   So this is the little thing in my ear.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.620]   This little thing in my ear, but watching the video.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620]   You mean a earpiece.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:21.620]   An earpiece.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.780]   And so we have ones that we use that are...
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.140]   This one's the cheap one, right?
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.780]   This is the cheap E-1.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.620]   But we have ones that you put into your ear and there's no cable to it at all.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.220]   And you can have those using either inductance so that someone's wearing like a little necklace
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:40.660]   under their shirt or you can do it on 2.4 frequency.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.660]   And so...
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.220]   I buy a few of those for the studio.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.620]   How do they make them?
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.620]   All the guys...
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.620]   All the clear-com.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.620]   All the cool guys.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.620]   And then anyway, there's a bunch of different people in here.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.620]   Other...
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.620]   The clear-com does not make them?
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.620]   I don't think clear-com makes the wireless ones.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.620]   I don't think clear-com makes the wireless ones.
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.020]   But the wireless ones, there's a lot of people that make them auto-make them.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.820]   Anyways, a bunch of different companies that make them.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.820]   And so...
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.380]   Anyway, so those are the...
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.180]   I think that's probably what they're talking about is being able to put something in your
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:10.180]   ear that is not out there and around and not connected and still be able to hear it.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.940]   Now, what's do you picture that being something that you're going to take out your regular
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.940]   hearing aid and then put that in?
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.940]   No, it's not hearing aid at all.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.500]   It's just a...
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.980]   We use them so that you can have it on like we can do with the conversation that we're
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.980]   having right now.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.980]   Sure.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.980]   And you don't see anything.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.580]   You know, we do them specifically so you don't see anything while you're there.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:26.580]   I thought this was about, right?
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.900]   I thought this was specifically about hearing aids.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.900]   I don't...
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.740]   Well, it's a hearing aid maker that's doing it.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.860]   But the issue is that that is incredibly useful.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:39.300]   Think about how goofy people look with their little Bluetooth, you know, ear sets and everything
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   else.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.980]   What if you just got to a point where you had something in your ear and then it's just...
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.660]   You're kind of permanent like all day.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.540]   Just kind of there's one ear.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.300]   And the reason that hearing aids are interesting is because hearing aids oftentimes and in
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:56.740]   real space, you know, in ear options, you'll hear everything.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.900]   Like this one that I'm wearing right now blocks everything.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.340]   So I can only hear from one side because I hear the show on the other side.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.860]   In a hearing aid environment that is also hooked to a 2.4, you're hearing everything
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   out of that ear.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.900]   You're just putting something into your ear that you're hearing everything that happens
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   around you.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.540]   But you're also hearing your phone call, music, you know, all those other things.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.380]   And I just have to say that I would buy one of those in a second.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.540]   And he's not even there about you.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.220]   Like, you know, like the idea like just six million a year and from now on when I get phone
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.220]   calls, it's in my ear.
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.220]   I don't have to pick up my phone.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.540]   So why is that different from a Bluetooth ear head?
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.140]   No, because no one would see it.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.340]   Number one, number two is just an ear.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.540]   Yeah, it's not wiggling around on your ear.
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.540]   It's not connecting.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:42.100]   The problem is is that the Bluetooth pieces is it's always hanging, you know, and you're
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.700]   dealing with it and you look like a microphone.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   Well, it's a microphone too.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.700]   Would this be a microphone?
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.260]   You could either have a separate microphone or you could have it.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.820]   You mean you could definitely do it from the ear.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.700]   The audio quality would be pretty bad.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.020]   But you could do it that way or you could have something attached to you that would
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.020]   let you do it.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.140]   But it just would get rid of that whole wired connection versus Bluetooth.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.660]   It'd be pretty nifty.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:08.700]   Web 76, some of you footed in our chat room says he uses something from Siemens called
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.700]   the Tech T-E-K.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.860]   You're hanging around your neck.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.220]   And apparently it's a wireless connection to your mobile phone, your TV and other audio
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:21.100]   devices sends audio signals to your ears and true stereo enhanced speech clarity.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.540]   I guess this is for people who are hard of hearing, but is that what you kind of want?
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:30.580]   It's always can be connected to your phone, TV, DVR, MP3 player using Bluetooth.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.900]   And go see those go right in your ear.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.900]   I won't let those.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:38.900]   I don't know much about the technology, but that's a big deal with modern digital hearing
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.060]   aids where there's like standards, there are standards for connectivity to electronic devices
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.140]   so that you don't have to worry about operating a phone.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.460]   You don't have to necessarily worry about switching it to mono.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:53.780]   If you have a certain kind of hearing loss, it's really interesting stuff and the sort
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.980]   of stuff that's absolutely invisible to people who are outside of that community.
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:01.220]   We're going to take a break, we're talking about Macintosh, Andy Inako, Chicago Sun
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.500]   Times is here in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.300]   From beautiful...
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.020]   Is it snowing in...
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.940]   Are you in Massachusetts?
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.940]   Is it snowing?
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:18.200]   No, not yet, although tomorrow, the most awful travel day ever, we're supposed to get
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.780]   hellaciously bed weather.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.660]   Oh man, I have canned goods.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.860]   I might not go for Thanksgiving.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.860]   I might just...
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.900]   It's kind of a yearly ritual to watch Andy's power go out as a refrigerator go dead for
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   a week and...
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.700]   I'll get some more nice columns about it.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.700]   Every year.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.660]   I'm smelling like all the food in my fridge.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:44.340]   You might consider moving to somewhere where the more salubrious climate, Mr. Inako.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:48.100]   Or maybe just buying one of those generators for the bicycle wheel hooked up to it, at
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:52.340]   least cook up a hot pocket on day three of the power outage.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.740]   Metal power.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.420]   From nozilla casts.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.660]   Allison Sheridan is here of Podfeet.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.660]   What is nozilla cast?
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.220]   Tell us about that.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:07.660]   So it's an audio podcast that is a technology podcast with an ever so slight Macintosh bias.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.900]   In other words, it's really biased.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:14.740]   But I do a lot of tech review stuff, the gadget software, that kind of thing I've listened
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.740]   to reviews.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.580]   And then the second half of the show is called Chit Chat Across the Pond.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.220]   And it's often a guy named Bart Bouchatz from Ireland who talks about security.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.220]   We're doing a Taming the Terminal series, things like that.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:29.860]   But then I'll have photography topics on too, like with Kirsch and Sia was on this week
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.460]   to talk about how she photographs cyclists.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:37.700]   And so it's kind of all over the map, but always tech and always biased.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.100]   But I'll do Linux stuff and I've had Linux people on too.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.300]   I love the idea of teaching people the terminal.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   That's a good card.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.700]   Yeah, it's a cool series.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:49.100]   He's a really good teacher and I kind of play the stooge a little bit.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.980]   I usually know some of what he's talking about, but I'm supposed to be when I get confused,
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.620]   I'm supposed to say so, so he slows down for the rest of us.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.620]   Yeah, I do that all the time.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:59.620]   Huh?
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.620]   What?
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.580]   I don't understand.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:09.540]   Also here from Parts Unknown, Mr. Alex Lindsey of Pixel Core.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.780]   Got your yearly haircut, I see.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   Exactly.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.780]   I was turning it.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.300]   Well, what happened is I can't, you know, I can't decide, you know, I tried to get a hold
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   of her.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.300]   She's very busy.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.140]   So we share a hairdresser, I think.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.140]   I think we do.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.460]   So, so, yeah, so it's, I did get my haircut.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:31.060]   No, I'll get a cut in six months again after I turn it into like a hippie and I have it
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.060]   in a pout party too.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.060]   It's always fun.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.060]   So no, in time of year it is based on Alex's hair.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.180]   Well, you can always tell my travel schedule broke enough to get in and get my haircut.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.180]   Right.
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.180]   Right.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.020]   So I got a week, we only had one event this week.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.180]   Where are you going next?
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.340]   I am in Los Angeles next week.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.500]   And a movie thing.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.500]   Yes, a movie thing.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.500]   Oh, I love it.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   So we got a movie thing.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.500]   He meets all these famous people.
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.700]   But a movie thing, a car thing, a giveaway thing and a game thing.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.300]   Who are who of the, you probably can't say, but if you could of the people you're going
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.380]   to meet next week, who are you most excited about?
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.380]   The movie thing.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.380]   Yeah, I know.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.620]   But what, who, give us one star?
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.380]   There's a big movie coming down next.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.380]   Rad Pit.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   There's a big.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.380]   You've met Will Smith.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.380]   Yes.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.660]   You've met, who's your favorite that you've met so far?
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.660]   Oh, you've met the president.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.860]   Mm hmm.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.500]   My, if you met the first lady.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   I can't get into who I met.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.660]   There's been a lot of, let's just say there's been a lot of hangouts.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:27.900]   There's been a lot of hangouts there.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.500]   So you're going to meet Ben Affleck?
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   No, no.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.620]   You're going to meet, uh, Aaron Paul.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:33.620]   Maybe you'll meet Aaron Paul.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.620]   No, there's a big.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:36.620]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.620]   No.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.100]   Oh, I know who you're going to meet.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.100]   Will Ferrell.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.860]   Is he going to be that would be really being wearing a red suit?
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.860]   That would be fun.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.860]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.500]   I saw, um, funniest dads here doing with the Anchorman too.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.100]   The, um, anyway, so, but, uh, you can't tell us.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.500]   The movie one is going to be less teasing himself, kind of saying.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.340]   So you can tell me off, uh, obviously you're not whispering my ear and I can go.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.500]   Oh, Ron Burgundy.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   It's also here.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.500]   I would love, by the way, I would love to do it.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.900]   If Wolfrails was listening, I would love to do a hangout with Wolfrails.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.700]   Oh, so, uh, it'd be so fun.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.700]   No, it'd be so fun.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:13.700]   Yep.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.140]   Also from iMoor.com and, uh, Crackberry.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.140]   What is it?
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.140]   What is it?
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.140]   Crackberry.com, Crackberry.
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.540]   And what's the control of Windows phones?
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.540]   We get around.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.100]   He gets, he does it all.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.100]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, iMoor.com.
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.340]   Oh, Renee, just, just for fun.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:32.060]   If someone made you an offer for that domain, Crackberry.com, are you going to be looking
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.980]   forward and thinking that I think $5,000 for that domain name can be more valuable than
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.940]   coverage about the Blackberry for the next 10 years?
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.940]   The Mayor of Toronto is listening.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.860]   It's the new, the new Rob Ford site.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:48.460]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.420]   Now I'm telling you, when you set up that new site, you want to use a hosting services.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.540]   Now we're going to go down because what if you get really popular?
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.820]   We just brought, we brought the Siemens site down.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.460]   Everybody went over to see the Siemens tech and the site went down.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.100]   You know, Squarespace never goes down.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.300]   I challenge you to bring down.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.820]   I'll tell you what, everybody go to inside.toit.tv.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:09.340]   That's our Squarespace site, our internal blog.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.140]   If you all went there at the same time, if a hundred thousand people went at the same
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.500]   time, Squarespace, they've got the squirrels in the basement or something and they just
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:20.140]   fire it up and they go, and they never run out of bandwidth.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.140]   It's the power of the cloud.
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.540]   It's the power of the cloud.
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.180]   And I think part of the reason is because it's so tightly integrated between, in fact,
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.260]   they've told me this, between the software that they're running, the content management
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.460]   system that's on top of the hosting that they're running, they have absolute control.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:40.300]   Squarespace will give you a gorgeous site for your photography portfolio, for your blog,
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.420]   for your store.
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.100]   They do e-commerce too.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.900]   It's mobile, all the sites are mobile.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.940]   Every one of their templates is designed to be mobile responsive.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:54.500]   That means it looks great on a 27-inch display, on a 32-inch display, on a 4-inch display.
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   In 4K.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.500]   In 4K.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:57.500]   It all looks great.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.660]   In fact, when you upload an image to your site, they automatically make nine different
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.660]   versions of it.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.020]   So one for every size, go to squarespace.com, click Get Started.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.500]   And let's get started.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.700]   Two weeks free, you don't need to give them a credit card or any personal information.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.700]   Your first challenge will be to pick a template.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.340]   You've got 20 starting points.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.220]   I don't even want to call them templates.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.420]   Starting points, but then you customize it.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.980]   If you click any one of them, you'll see that once you start customizing it, they all look
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.940]   unique.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.540]   You don't have to be a JavaScript or CSS guru to do this.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.700]   It's all drag and drop, point and click.
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:33.700]   Some beautiful.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:37.100]   These are all real Squarespace sites, just gorgeous stuff.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.700]   I want you to visit squarespace.com.
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.700]   Take advantage of this.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.700]   Two weeks free.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.700]   You don't have to give them any personal information.
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:47.180]   Just your email address, if you forget your password, you can get back into it.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:53.180]   And then, and then once you do that and you decide you want to buy, wow, you will be blown
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.380]   away by the pricing.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:58.100]   Sites start as low as $8 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:00.980]   By the way, an annual plan is a good idea because they'll hook up, hook you up with
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.700]   a domain name for free and all of that and put it all together.
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:06.860]   The most popular is the unlimited plan.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:11.340]   $16 a month, you get unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited pages, galleries
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.740]   and blogs.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:16.100]   You can, by the way, if you're a JavaScript developer, use their developer platform.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.100]   It's sweet.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.140]   And if you decide you want to sell stuff, maybe the holiday season is coming and I don't
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.540]   know, you make T-cozies and you'd like to get a brisk and booming business in T-cozies.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.140]   If you're not selling online, you're kind of missing out on the big international audience.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.060]   It's only $24 a month with an annual plan and you get everything you need.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.340]   There are no transaction fees paid to Squarespace.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.340]   That's the cost.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.540]   You're going to have unlimited physical goods.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:43.420]   If you have digital T-cozies, you can sell those too.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.540]   Service products become and we service your T-cozies.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.540]   You can sell that too.
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.500]   What would you do with a digital T-cozies?
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.420]   Well, you keep your digital T-warm is what you do.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:58.020]   Unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, storage contributors, inventory tracking is included.
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.620]   They do tax calculations.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.140]   They do shipping coupon controls.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.140]   The works.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.500]   Oh, I do should tell you one more thing.

[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380]   I like that.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   What do you think?
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380]   You found what you want?
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.380]   I'm getting that.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.380]   You're getting a Siemens Eye Mini?
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.380]   Made him in it.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.380]   Made him in it.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.380]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.380]   You go to hearingplanet.com.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.380]   Hearingplanet.com.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.380]   Hearingplanet.com.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.620]   I've been doing lots of research.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.620]   You understand that Alex is not deaf in any way.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.340]   He just wants the one that I'm familiar with is the Phonak.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.340]   See these Phonak ones?
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.340]   These are popular in practice.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.860]   Where do I go to hearing aids?
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.860]   Hearing aids.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.860]   Go to Phonak.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.860]   Well, that's the one that I'm familiar with.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.860]   So Phonak is...
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:48.860]   I want the Bolero.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.860]   Wow.
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.860]   So these little ones.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.860]   See these little...
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.860]   Nana here?
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:53.860]   That's all in here.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.860]   That's in here.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   Virto Q.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.860]   So that is...
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.860]   Oh!
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.860]   1599.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.860]   And this might be just a hearing aid.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.860]   So the Phonak ones.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.820]   Which one we used in the past.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   I'm getting real...
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.660]   He easily connects to mobile phones, TVs, computers, tablets, mp3 players.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.660]   Right.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.260]   There's a standard is what you were saying for this.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:14.900]   I know I'll see hearing aid ready phones.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.900]   Is that Bluetooth?
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.460]   How does that work?
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.460]   I think there's more of a...
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.460]   I don't know.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.220]   We have a transmitter and receiver.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.980]   But it's 2.4.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.540]   It's not Bluetooth.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.540]   This is more like a Wi-Fi kind of...
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.340]   I'm going to need one of these any minute now.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.340]   So I might as well...
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.100]   You know, after years in broadcasting with headphones turned up way too high.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.540]   I'm pretty much deaf.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.540]   You get the...
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.540]   ...tonitis?
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.380]   Yeah, my ear is ringing all the time.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.380]   Do you have tonitis?
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.780]   That explains the high-pitched tone I'm hearing from your head.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.780]   No, I...
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   You know what I said?
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.780]   Because I live somewhere...
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.780]   That's the influence.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   I got a new house that's quiet.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.980]   And all of a sudden I now know how my ears are ringing constantly.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.980]   Yes.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   Because it's so quiet.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.980]   Yes.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.980]   Bring me the noise.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980]   That's the sound of silence.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980]   I'm just thinking this on.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.980]   Exactly, Allison.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.500]   I used to sit right up next to the speakers.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.420]   I always had the headphones on.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.900]   And you know, when you're a DJ for years...
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   You want to hear your voice.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.700]   You want to hear exactly how good you sound.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:15.700]   And you end up turning them up and then you get deaf and you turn them up again and you
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.500]   get deaf or you turn them up again.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:22.140]   You're like, "Really soon, you're talking like this because nobody can hear you."
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.140]   Can I tell you?
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:27.580]   Just in case you're wondering, if you meet a sound guy who talks loudly, that's not your
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.580]   sound guy.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   That's pretty normal.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.540]   But I mean, I'm just telling you that he's not the guy that should work on your event
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.980]   because it means that your sound, your audio guy is deaf.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.980]   What?
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.780]   No, it's like, I got a blank in it.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.460]   I want to defend us because I have tinnitus.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.740]   My ears are ringing.
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.140]   I don't hear as well as I used to, but I still hear well.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.140]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.140]   I have a...
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.140]   You can think of quality.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.140]   It's quality.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.140]   Not quantity.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.140]   No, I still test well.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.140]   You know, like I always go on.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.140]   No, I never test well.
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:59.540]   But for instance, when I'm listening to Codex, Steve Gibson was trying to do it.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540]   I'm doing a speech codec.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.340]   And I said, no, I don't like that as well.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.340]   Right.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.340]   Because I can hear stuff that...
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.140]   So my earrings are not gone.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.140]   He's like a cat.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.940]   That's why they call them whiskers.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.940]   I think they're really...
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.700]   The high frequency stuff I can hear, like little girl's voices, just...
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.260]   The high frequency stuff.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.140]   I need something to just burn that out.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.860]   Can you hear the mosquito sound?
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.340]   I can.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.740]   I could as of about three or four years ago, and I'm 55 now.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.780]   So I was in my early 50s when I could still hear it and it was painful.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.980]   And for all the kids who don't like going up to the board, the key is understanding
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.060]   that the flat part of the chalk is what may...
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.060]   Look at that!
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.060]   The choreography is on!
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.060]   Everything's on!
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.060]   He didn't appreciate that at all.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.060]   By the way, be careful with that.
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:47.060]   I played that for a crowd once because I thought it was a joke.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:51.060]   And several young people told me they had a headache for more than a day.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.060]   I'm really sorry.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.060]   And it's actually really painful to say.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.060]   I heard nothing at all.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.060]   No, I heard that.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.060]   That was 11 kilohertz.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   That was nothing.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   I feel like I'm in the Superman.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.420]   You know he's going to keep playing with it, don't you?
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:06.300]   No, I'm not going to touch it anymore because the whole chatroom erupted in pain.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.300]   As if a thousand souls...
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.380]   Yeah, so the key is snuffed out.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.180]   The key is to understand that the chalk...
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.180]   This is why you get rid of chalk.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.460]   The flat part of the chalk creates the screech on the chalkboard.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.460]   And so what you do...
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.100]   I used to hate going up to the board so I would just go up and just put the flat part
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.100]   on and I would just go...
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.140]   And then I'd look over like, "I don't understand what's wrong with this chalk."
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.020]   And then I'd go, "You only get called up ones."
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:32.820]   It's amazing that even through all the squeezing and compression we do of this video that that
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.820]   11 kilohertz tone...
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:34.820]   It's still...
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.820]   Still got down to it.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.820]   Still tortured our chatroom.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.020]   Yes, but if we were on AM radio you wouldn't hear it at all.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020]   Oh no.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020]   How do you...
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.820]   And if you're an AMD-J you wouldn't hear it either as I do not.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820]   I am so sorry.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.660]   You know, half the chatroom is going, "I have a headache."
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.660]   The other half is saying, "What?"
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.660]   I didn't hear anything.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.660]   Exactly.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.660]   Isn't that weird?
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.660]   Hmm.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.420]   They made a good point.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.420]   You might want to mute that from the record.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.820]   Yeah, that chat comment is very, very correct.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:03.100]   There are going to be a lot of people who are like, have their headphones on the bus
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.660]   that suddenly are going to be slapping them away.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.340]   And their head will explode like scanners.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.340]   Can you...
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:09.820]   Did you hear it, Brian?
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.220]   He did because he's a young guy.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.220]   So you know where it was.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.620]   Can you cut that out?
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.620]   And then everybody listening at home will go, "What is he talking about?
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.620]   I must be dead."
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.620]   Yeah, no one on the recording is going to hear it at all.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.620]   Yeah, we're going to take that out.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.500]   Can you hear the headphones banned from German Parliament?
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.220]   Does that mean they can still have Android phones but no iPhones?
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.980]   They're playing too much Candy Crush?
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.820]   Yes, probably.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.820]   Not using micro-USB.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.540]   iPads were banned from 10 Downing Street due to spying fears.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:40.100]   And now the German Parliament concerned about NSA eavesdropping.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.540]   Oh, gosh.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.380]   But the odd thing is why they decided iPhones are more...
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.380]   It's more...
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.380]   American company, Leo.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.380]   The NSA invented them.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:59.540]   Only software approved by the Bonn Federal Office for Information Security can be used.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:06.100]   I presume that Androids are also banned but this is focused on iPhones.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.660]   It's an article from Kultimak that's odd.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.940]   Apple is selling Sim-free, unlocked iPhone 5s in the US.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]   Hallelujah.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.020]   And why is that such a big deal?
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.540]   We have that for the iPhone 5, right?
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.340]   Yeah, just they didn't have it right away from the iPhone.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.340]   They didn't have it right away from the iPhone 5s.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.900]   You had to buy it from a carrier.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.900]   Unlocked is great because you could put it...
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.900]   I was kind of glad I fell behind.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:27.900]   I haven't got my 5s yet.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.900]   Not cheap.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.900]   849 dollars for the 6-year-old.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.300]   I spent a lot of time overseas.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.220]   It prevents scalping for you days of launch.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.540]   Oh, that's why they do it upfront.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.140]   They want to make sure...
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.420]   A lot of places they get so many people.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.860]   It's always the same 20 dues lined up in front of the Apple Store every day to buy unlocked
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.220]   units and send them other places.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:49.820]   And if they make them unavailable, then that lets actual customers show up and get iPhones
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:50.820]   unlocked there.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.540]   Yeah, I think unlocked is great.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.700]   And it's what I generally buy, even though you pay, of course, a premium because it's
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.700]   unsubsidized.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.700]   No, I was told I was...
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.700]   I have friends in Zimbabwe.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.620]   He's like, "Yeah, if you took 10 iPads and you could basically fly it as Zimbabwe and
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.620]   stay for a week and pay for the whole thing."
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.380]   Just don't bring it to bond, apparently.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.380]   Yeah, so it doesn't...
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:16.100]   It's going to become more and more important too now that the Moto G is now shipping.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.020]   And here's an unlocked phone that's really, really good.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.620]   It costs $200 flat and you own it.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.340]   So I think it's going to be more pressure, particularly...
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:28.260]   And in the United States, particularly as ST Mobile and other carriers are doing a lot
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.260]   more...
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.540]   I try to draw a lot more, bring your own device people to like contract month-to-month contract
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.420]   free data plans and voice plans.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:41.580]   So I think that it's going to be more and more important that makers have an unlocked
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:47.460]   option that is not something buried on page three of three submenus on the website, but
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.180]   do you want it white or black?
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.180]   Black?
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:51.180]   Good.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.180]   Do you want it locked or unlocked?
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.180]   Got it.
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:56.100]   I always think of news stories from China as kind of the equivalent of news of the world.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.100]   You don't really know.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100]   It could be...
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100]   That boy.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100]   Alien-siding.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100]   I'm playing a baby.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100]   You don't really...
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.100]   And there's always the woman who got electrocuted by her iPhone.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]   Right.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.100]   Things like that.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.100]   But this one is such a good story.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:13.220]   So just take it with a grain of salt.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:18.660]   A thief stole an iPhone, pickpocket an iPhone from a man named Zobin.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:22.940]   Zob had a lot of contacts on his phone, no backup.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.100]   He texted the thief, "I know you are the man who sat behind me.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.860]   I can assure you that I will find you."
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.420]   This is the equivalent of...
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.420]   Lea Neeson.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.660]   Lea Neeson's.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:39.540]   I have certain skills.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:43.180]   The text message goes on to say, "Look through the contact numbers in my mobile and
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.660]   you will know what trade I am in.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:52.500]   Send me back the phone to the address below if you are sensible."
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.140]   He didn't get the phone back.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.740]   Apparently he works in an industry linked in China to gang activity.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:02.820]   He didn't get the phone back, but he did get a parcel containing his SIM card and 1,000
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.900]   handwritten phone numbers.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   Contact numbers.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:07.700]   I would have sent the phone back.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.300]   I was going to sample the Crook's handwriting and probably finger prints too.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   That was smart.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:19.940]   I'm sure it's going to take us down or get us taken down off of YouTube, but I just got
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:20.940]   to play this.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:21.940]   There we go.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:22.940]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.940]   There's an ad.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:24.940]   Hold on a second.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.780]   We don't want to play ads when we steal videos.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.780]   We want the original.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:32.140]   So is that advice to make sure that we start to salt our contact database with like...
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.140]   Secret Service.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.140]   Tony Siprano.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.140]   555.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.380]   One of the guys.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:42.180]   One of the guys in our team named his Wi-Fi.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.900]   When we build Wi-Fi signals, it's always NSA surveillance.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.900]   We have an F...
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.900]   That's where we're getting the FBI surveillance fans.
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:48.900]   Probably from you.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.900]   All right.
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.900]   Liam Neeson, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.020]   I don't know who you are.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.420]   I don't know what you want.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:03.580]   If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.460]   are a very particular set of skills.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.900]   Skills I've acquired over a very long career.
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.500]   Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.940]   Give him his phone back.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.860]   If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.660]   I will not look for you.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.460]   I will not pursue you.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.460]   But?
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.940]   But if you don't, I will look for you.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.940]   I will find you.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:27.940]   Oh boy.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.940]   And I will kill you.
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.940]   Aah!
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   Aah!
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   Send him his iPhone.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   Send him his iPhone.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   That's what I should have said.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.860]   You should have sent the movie.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:42.300]   I'm putting that on my iPhone.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.420]   And then just going to have it triggered.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.220]   You can have the sound trigger, the high-pitched sound.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.420]   But maybe I could have Liam Neeson.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.980]   The high-pitched sound would be kind of useful.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.980]   Or the mosquito sound.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.420]   11-killer-hertz tone.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.820]   I will find you.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.060]   I don't know if I believe that story.
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.980]   A lot of the stories that come out of the Chinese news services are a little...
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.980]   Pat.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.540]   Yes, you know what I'm saying?
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.540]   But it's a good story.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:05.820]   China Mobile is going to get the iPhone.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.300]   It's official.
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.300]   One day.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.300]   One day.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.300]   One day.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.300]   Chunching.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.300]   December 18th.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.860]   And this is the biggest carrier in China has never had the iPhone.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.900]   Other smaller carriers have.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.740]   The Chinese government has confirmed that they still must be true.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.740]   The world's biggest carrier.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:29.460]   So do you think that's going to cause a significant shift in global market share?
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:30.460]   Wow.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.460]   Well, I don't know.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.300]   I mean, you know, it's an expensive phone.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.260]   I don't think it's a global market share, but I think it's a lot of revenue.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.860]   I mean, I don't think Apple needs to change the global...
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:44.140]   The 1% or 2% in China would be an enormous number.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:50.940]   According to an analyst in Hong Kong, China Mobile has the most wealthy subscriber base.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.900]   700 million subscribers, at least 10% or 70 million wealthier ones would be potential
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:56.900]   customers.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.700]   So potentially 70 million iPhones.
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:11:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.700]   That's a number.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:03.100]   That's more than they sold less quarter.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:07.500]   Apple has 0% nor do they want any percent of the under $400 phone market, but they have
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.940]   an incredible amount of the over $500 from market.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:10.940]   And that's what they want to target.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.860]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.300]   And still the analysts are saying, "Oh, Apple, come on.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.380]   Why didn't you offer a cheap 5C?
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.380]   Why did you make the 5C?"
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.700]   Is there a metric that shows what percentage is Apple versus Android over $400?
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:25.700]   Oh, that's a...
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.460]   I was talking to Ben Bajaren from TechPinnions about it.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460]   He's got a lot of stats up.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.740]   I think he did a global smartphone post very recently on it.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.460]   But it's the same thing with computers where Apple issued the netbook market.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.900]   They just have no interest in the low end and they have a very, very large share of the
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.900]   high end.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:45.100]   Well, I mean, there's definitely a whole argument about the financial quality of the
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.900]   consumer as well, which is why you want to have one of the advantages of selling something
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.540]   that's more expensive is that everyone that's buying it is also buying a lot of other things.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.940]   And it's just not...
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:55.940]   The number of...
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.340]   The raw number of customers is not necessarily the full value of the process.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.620]   And I think the stuff that it needs to be segmented now, like a lot of other industries have
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.620]   been for a while.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.820]   There's a lot of things you can sell to a BMW, you know, someone buying a new BMW that you're
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:12.660]   not going to sell to someone buying a new Kia.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.660]   Exactly.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:20.140]   So the consensus then is it's not worth trying to go after the sub $400 market?
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:24.780]   It's like the netbook market, Leo.
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.780]   Right.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.980]   But in any business, you have to decide where you fit in.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.260]   So, and I've got to point this out, Apple has in the past, if you look at the iPod, for
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:36.420]   instance, they, as we've pointed out before, they ate up the top end of the market and
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:40.580]   then when they'd eaten as much as they could, when they'd feast as well as they could, they
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.860]   expanded it to the low end of the market and then basically killed it.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.860]   And I think it makes sense if they can do that.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:50.700]   I don't know if the iPod market and the phone market are the same as far as being able to
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.820]   do something that cheap and make it compelling.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.940]   I think that if Apple figures out a way to do that, I think that they probably would
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:00.300]   keep on going that direction.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.300]   But you do have to be careful of, as you go down, it's usually more trouble and less.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:09.300]   I didn't remember going to a class many years ago taught by a brilliant guy named Alex Lindsey.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.700]   It was the first time I'd ever seen him speak and he said...
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.700]   Okay, it's crazy.
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.700]   A bit of a prick.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.700]   He's also deaf.
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.700]   He said...
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.700]   It was crazy deaf guy Alex Lindsey.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:23.640]   Anyway, he said that the reason he writes tools for people who use Apple products is because
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.580]   people who use Apple products will spend a lot of money.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.580]   I remember him saying that.
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:29.580]   That's true.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.460]   I said, "There'll spend more money."
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:37.180]   They'll spend more money and they're also easier to take care of.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.180]   You know, it's just...
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.180]   Well, yeah.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.180]   Yeah, that too.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.220]   Alex, I did find an article techopinions.com.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:48.380]   Unfortunately, it's phones over $400, but it's in US share.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.300]   We know they dominate there.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.940]   But yeah, it's here was 64%.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:59.580]   Apple only has 12% globally of the phone market and that's because their phones are so expensive.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.580]   Right.
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.220]   So the question is, is it worth doing something to get the other 78% or 88%?
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.980]   Yeah, I don't remember what the...
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.940]   We probably find the exact story, but there was...
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.660]   When Dodge came out with their new truck, this is a long time ago with a Dodge Ram truck
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.940]   or whatever, and they went through opinion polls.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.620]   They found that 15% said they just absolutely had to have it.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.380]   And I believe that it was like 60% said it was the worst...
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:27.940]   Or 50% said it was the worst thing they'd ever seen and 35% were on the...
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:28.940]   And they said, "Well, that's a failure.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:29.940]   We're not going to do that."
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.820]   And the CEO was crazy.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:38.740]   Our current market size is 7% and going to 15% would double our revenue.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.700]   You just have to...
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.220]   And the point is, is that in a highly...
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:48.940]   In a very mature market like cars, no one has that massive percent.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:54.380]   So we're used to this new market where everybody's got 50% or 60% or it's really a fight between
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.380]   Apple and Google.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:16:00.140]   But I think that number one is I think that Apple doesn't need to have that to be very,
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.140]   very profitable.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.100]   And number two is, I still think there's a lot of issues with Google.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.220]   I mean, not Google, but with Android that are about to flesh themselves out.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.220]   I think that...
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.500]   I don't know if we're going to be able to call everything that's in Android and Android
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.500]   much longer.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.460]   You look at what Samsung's doing and what Amazon's doing and everything else.
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.700]   Android may cease to be really a singular operating system that we can call on a majority.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.700]   The Chinese especially.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.700]   I don't think that...
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:32.540]   Whenever you hear all those columns and reports saying, "Oh, Apple's doing look how Android
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.060]   is gaining in market share and now overwhelming."
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:39.660]   Well, no, it's sort of like if you have one sensor chip that is in every toaster and every
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.940]   coffee pot and every car, that doesn't...
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.820]   There are so many people who are Android users who don't know or care that they're Android
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.420]   users where Android does not enhance the experience in any way, share before.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:55.180]   And when you look at the anti-theft, the stuff that I'm sure we talked about last week,
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.860]   but the whole anti-theft, it turns out that Verizon and AT&T and everyone else, they just
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.860]   turn that off.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.300]   You know, on the Android one, I'm like, "Nah, we're not going to do that."
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.300]   And Apple, the kill switch.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.300]   The kill switch.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.300]   They didn't want to kill switch.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.300]   Why didn't they want to kill switch?
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.020]   Because they sell insurance against having your phone stolen.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:14.460]   You know, you know, they would be big financial problems.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.300]   The insurance gives you a new phone.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.300]   The kill switch doesn't help that.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.300]   It just keeps your data safe.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.300]   I don't know.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.300]   It takes all the...
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.300]   I don't understand that.
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:22.300]   Because if everybody had a kill switch, it wouldn't...
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.300]   You still need a new phone.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.300]   But stealing phones.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.300]   Not as many people would steal them.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.300]   Not anymore.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.300]   Ahh.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.300]   So they want to encourage theft.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.300]   It's not that they want to encourage it.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.460]   They just want to leverage it.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   They don't want to discourage it.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.460]   Exactly.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.460]   They want to monetize it.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.300]   It's what they want to do without actually stealing phones themselves.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:45.060]   Now, expect on the market share thing, there's an unwiredview.com article about the iPhone
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:49.140]   5C generating some real traction in India.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   Is that important?
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.820]   No, I think absolutely.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.300]   I mean, I think that generating...
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.300]   You know, the emerging world is the growing...
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.860]   Is the growth of the good for us?
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.500]   Does that show price sensitivity?
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:02.980]   That even a hundred bucks less means it's enough of a cut to make it desirable?
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:03.980]   If that's why.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.780]   I mean, you know, there could be a variety of reasons.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.780]   Well, maybe they like the color phone.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.780]   Maybe it's culturally.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.100]   It might make more sense.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.700]   You know, in different parts of the world to have that.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:15.500]   Understanding is both a lot of Android manufacturers and Nokia are targeting what they call the
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.900]   next billion customers, which are people going to a phone for the first time or to a
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.620]   smartphone for the first time.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.780]   And for them, price is really one of the most important features.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:27.780]   And so far, Apple has no interest in that because it's not a valuable customer base
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.780]   for them.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.660]   They'd much rather be the second or third or fourth phone when someone is mature in the
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.540]   market and they want a better experience according to them or a more premium product.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.980]   And that worked well for them in computers.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.820]   And the thinking is that, you know, in the iPod, they had 70% market shares.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.940]   They had to start competing against themselves.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.980]   And phones are probably not going to get anywhere near that.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.340]   So their primary concern is to maintain the most profitable segment of that market.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.500]   And there's a profitable segment in all these markets.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:56.780]   I mean, when I was in Rwanda, I mean, everybody's gotten some kind of smartphone.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.860]   I mean, these are all like ambassadors and leaders and stuff like that, but they're
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.140]   all on their iPads and they have iPads and Android phones.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:03.140]   It's a status product.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.380]   I mean, the photo, it was Android phones and iPads.
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:09.260]   You know, those are the, that was kind of the mix that you saw pretty, pretty commonly.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.380]   But it's, but there's a lot of people there in any, in any one of these countries that
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.820]   are buying, they're buying Mercedes, they're buying high end phones, they're buying, you
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:16.820]   know, all those things.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.340]   And so, and that's in every culture.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.340]   So there's, there's definitely a market.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.300]   But it's the 1% or less or fewer.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.460]   Or the second or third time buyer.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:25.460]   Right.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.140]   This is why Windows Phone, by the way, is doing very well in India and other places is
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:33.180]   because Nokia has some very credible low end phones running Windows Phone.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.780]   They're good smartphones and they're less expensive.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:41.460]   They're doing quite well in those markets, which is a smart move for Microsoft and Nokia.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.380]   Who are those are Nokia phones?
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.380]   Yeah, they're no key.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.380]   They're inexpensive.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.380]   They're good inexpensive.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.980]   But is that that Asha thing or is it the, well, Asha's one, but, uh, five twenty.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.420]   Yeah, the five twenty is what?
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.300]   How much is the five twenty on, on subs?
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.300]   He's a hundred bucks.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.300]   It's cheap.
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.540]   And that's a real, and that's a genuine smartphone.
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.140]   I mean, I think, you know, in, in that marketplace, they're not saying, oh, well, you don't have
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:06.900]   Instagram or in the truth, they do now.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.620]   So even if they were, there you go.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.380]   Motor roll is offering the Moto G for one seventy nine.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:15.620]   It's going to be seen how profitable these will be for them though.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.620]   Right.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:18.620]   Right.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:23.500]   But I think that's one of the reasons Microsoft bought Nokia because they, they, they realized
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.300]   that this, this is a way to get into some of those markets.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.460]   It's not an either or thing.
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.460]   The all good markets.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.620]   I mean, these are, I mean, these are all good.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:33.060]   I mean, the, the low end market is a, is a, there's a lot of, there's a lot of revenue
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.060]   to be had there.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.740]   It's just, it's, and it's not whether Apple should or shouldn't, or whether that's a
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:37.740]   good market or not.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.780]   It's whether it's an app, a market that Apple should go into, you know, they, they just
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.260]   aren't maybe not built for that.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.820]   I mean, there's a lot of, you know, as a, like for instance, we're a production company.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.060]   There's a lot of productions I can do and I, there's certain ones I just can't do anymore.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.820]   You know, that it used to be able to.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:51.340]   Web 70 eight or nine.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.740]   The chat room says the reason that his wife got a five C is because she plans to drop it
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:55.740]   a lot.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   And she thought that that would be more robust.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.460]   If the five C had everything that the five S had.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:02.700]   It'd outsell the five S.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.700]   I would buy the five C.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.460]   I mean, I would, I would, it's a five.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.460]   I don't, I don't like this.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:09.540]   The, the, you know, all the hard surfaces.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.300]   I like it to be so, so I drop it a lot.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.380]   I actually played with the five C on Sunday.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:19.060]   We had a woman from Apple who actually does the materials for the five C. And she, of
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.740]   course, carried a five C. And that was, it feels nice.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:22.740]   It's a really nice phone.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:23.740]   It's a nice phone.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.540]   It's a lot of fun too.
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.540]   It's a fun phone.
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.860]   It feels like a nameled metal.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.020]   It doesn't mean like, you know, kincey pasta.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.900]   It's not Sam's, it's apple plastic or it's no kid plastic.
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.700]   It's not, it's not Sam's song plastic.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.300]   It feels like to just like, I didn't realize those were separate varieties.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.300]   No, they really are.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.860]   Like if you listen to Nokia or Apple engineers talk, they've been a lot of time and a lot
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.860]   of like bottomless pits of money making really good materials.
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.820]   It's part of their process.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.180]   So I've been scruggled already.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.180]   I searched for a hearing aid.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.180]   How long ago?
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.180]   10 minutes ago.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:58.060]   I was seeing ads for hearing aids now on my, okay, you can't escape.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.420]   That's the interesting thing, Leo.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.820]   Is that like, Android can sell you that cheap motor roll and make a lot of money off the
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.180]   phone after the audit, which is not an option for Apple yet.
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:06.180]   Right.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.020]   But when you log into Facebook, you'll get the same ad though, Leo.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   Somehow Facebook.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   I don't think so.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   I bet not.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   This is a Google ad.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.020]   I don't know.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.020]   That's a good question.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   Facebook's never seemed to give me ads that are of any use at all.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:21.060]   Oh, you said it's always asking about the continents, properties and things.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.060]   Okay.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.060]   They're trying to sell me a car.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.060]   A camera.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.660]   And a camera, digital photography, colleges.
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:28.460]   No, no, not a camera.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.460]   It says you should pursue a career as a pro photographer.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.460]   I can remind the green line.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.460]   Leo, I've often thought that.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.660]   I thought that you should give up.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.860]   I think they're right.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.700]   They must have looked at my pictures on Facebook and said, man, you're good.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:45.380]   To my problems that I buy things so quickly that that that I get ads for things that I
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.380]   already purchased.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.500]   I'm like, okay, you don't need to talk about this anymore.
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.020]   Like, you know, as I said, you know, I've already seen this stuff on Amazon.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.180]   And then all I got was because I was searching for the prices.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.540]   All I get is ads for stuff I'm trying to sell.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.540]   It's completely worthless.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:03.220]   Amazon's funny because it's their recommendation engine always tells me, oh, you would like
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.820]   something I've already bought.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:09.820]   No, that's the, well, you can go to your account settings and actually say, please forget
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:11.620]   that I ever searched for this and it will.
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.620]   That's nice.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.900]   But also, yeah, that's exactly the thing when we're talking about like invasion of privacy.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.700]   It's like, you know, corporations, they learn too much about it.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.860]   Ooh, there's a new David Bowie album.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.700]   Oh, my complaints.
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.020]   I have to admit, my complaint isn't the Amazon.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.380]   My complaint isn't that Google's doing it.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.620]   It's just they're not doing it very well.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.620]   Yeah, they're doing it badly.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:33.860]   I mean, if they were actually able to think about that a little more and hearing it.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.300]   I mean, it seems sensible.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.660]   In fact, I went to hearingplanet.com, right?
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.380]   So that's why I'm seeing a hearing planet.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.380]   Exactly.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:41.380]   I mean, that seems sensible.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:46.820]   Without getting into an Android rat hole, I've been noticing things that they've been,
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:51.700]   they've been adding to Google now now that I'm used to the idea where I needed to go
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.380]   someplace last night.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.500]   I happen to do like a quick Google search map search.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.140]   I got my desktop for it in the morning.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.380]   Okay, there it is in Google now.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:23:59.380]   There's the map.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:00.380]   There's a location easy to transfer.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:04.980]   But I did not notice that they added something where, oh, you were reading this website.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.140]   Do you realize that that website got updated in the last two days ago?
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.140]   Here's the free.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   Here's the fresh look at the contents of this page.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:11.620]   You can see so much time looking at it.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.620]   It's good.
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.620]   Alrighty then.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.620]   Thank you.
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:20.700]   I'm also getting a lot of ads for coin, which I've talked a lot about how bad coin is, but
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.780]   they seem to think I should buy one anyway.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.780]   So here's the story that I was looking at.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:28.380]   Apple posted Black Friday teaser.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.420]   They did it first in Australia, which is a little odd because I don't think Australia
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.660]   celebrates Thanksgiving, but apparently the day after Thanksgiving is still a big deal
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.660]   in international shopping.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.660]   For Apple, Apple does it everywhere.
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.260]   They do it in silly year everywhere.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:39.340]   This is it.
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:43.060]   And the story by the very well-named Buster Heine.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.700]   Is that his real name?
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:45.700]   Come on, man.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.900]   He must have a hard time on April Fool's Day.
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:50.860]   Nobody believes any of his posts.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:55.980]   I say hypothetically that there are two PR people that email me regularly that I'm at
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:02.100]   least 82% sure you pick that name just to make it stand out inside of email.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:08.060]   That's either a porn name or a very, very unfortunate translation of something.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.260]   If his parents named him Buster Heine.
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.660]   I just don't know what to say.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.540]   Anyway, enough of that.
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:17.900]   So what is Apple going to do?
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.100]   Traditionally, they don't do the biggest discounts ever.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.300]   This is the only time they have.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.300]   You can get 5% off.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:25.300]   100 bucks off a laptop.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.300]   That's typical.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.300]   MacBook Pros, $101.00, MacBook Air is $101.00.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.300]   That's a lot of radio.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.380]   I've had $461.00 to $30.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.980]   That's last year, not this year.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:34.980]   Oh, is this last year?
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   Oh, you're right.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   That's right.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.540]   But that's probably representative kind of thing.
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:39.540]   5%.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.380]   But it wouldn't be nice if they surprised us.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.940]   Well, that can be more than 5.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.820]   That's $101.00 off even last time.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:46.820]   It's not bad.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:48.820]   That's right.
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:54.060]   It's not Elbow, a parent of three in the face at 4 AM on Thanksgiving morning.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.540]   Good discount, but still it's like it's like...
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:02.020]   Black Friday, ironically, is at least certainly on the online world is nonsensical.
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.020]   Every day is Black Friday.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.380]   There's, you know, I mean, that makes no sense.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.380]   The only time any more seems to me, Black Friday makes sense is if you are in the physical
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.620]   brick and mortar world and you want to get in line at 3 AM at Walmart to get a $19
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:14.620]   television sale.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   Oh.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620]   I mean, really seriously, right?
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.620]   I mean, I don't understand.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.620]   Who cares about Black Friday?
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.740]   If you really want to buy from an Apple store, this is the only time you can do that and
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:22.740]   get a sale price.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:23.980]   That's what's once a year for that.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:24.980]   Right.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.980]   This is it.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.980]   So it's good to know.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.980]   And it'll take a long time.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:28.980]   You don't have to wait in line.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:29.980]   And it's not great deals anyway.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:30.980]   No.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.980]   You have the sharp stick, though.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.140]   Well, I mean, I'll take it.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.140]   100 bucks.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.140]   Yeah, why not?
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.820]   And you'll need a sharp stick on Black Friday.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:41.820]   Yes.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   Yes, you will.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.140]   And you'll be in the days.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140]   Sharp sticks.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.140]   Yes.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:48.140]   They sell them at a discount at Walmart.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.140]   I heard a star base hard.
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:52.500]   I get there early, then get them at Walmart and then go to Target.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.940]   That's that's when they sell when they sell the sharp sticks on on Thursday.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.380]   I didn't read this post, but Eric Schmidt apparently posted something on Google+, on
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:04.180]   how to convert to Android from iPhone.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.180]   All his Android.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.740]   She keeps iPhone friends are switching to Android Leo.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.940]   Never mind that he's been using a Blackberry, his iPhone friends are switching to Android.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.500]   He didn't write the Blackberry Switcher's Guide, which would have been really nice of
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500]   him.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.500]   But he did.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500]   I thought this was really interesting.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.900]   So basically he just walks through, here's the kind of stuff you need to do and back it
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.900]   up.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:24.460]   And here's how you move your contacts and here's how you do this.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:29.420]   And the other thing, what was fascinating to me was how adult the comments were.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:30.940]   There's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.620]   I probably read 50.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:37.300]   And either somebody was really moderating them or it is a sign of how good Google+ comments
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:41.660]   are because at least half of them were people saying, oh, yeah, you know, this really helps.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.260]   You know, it's a great idea and everything in the other half where people saying, well,
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.300]   you know, I've got a lot of friends who tried to switch and they've actually switched back
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:48.300]   to the iPhone.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.980]   It was just, it was really measured an interesting dialogue going on there.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.820]   Well that's kind of Google+, yeah.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:58.860]   The best social network for you to stay in touch with your friends who work at Google.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.060]   And it's also, thank you.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.060]   I think I still have a nice case of these.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:07.380]   I wonder why no PR people write you, Leo.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.380]   Next I'm on there, Liz.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:11.620]   Do you think Eric wrote Tyler Moore of the industry?
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.740]   You know, what do you like?
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.500]   Do you think Eric wrote this himself?
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.500]   No.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:24.340]   You know, the reason, one reason I think not is this line in the very first paragraph,
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.900]   they are a great Christmas present to an iPhone user exclamation mark.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.940]   I don't see Eric Schmidt using an exclamation mark here.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.420]   No, no.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.780]   It was suggested he did not write that.
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.420]   But he did not write it.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.420]   It was suggested by whom?
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:39.980]   It's been suggested by various people on the internet that he did not write that.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:42.140]   Well I want to syntactic analysis.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.140]   Can we get Watson to work on this?
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.140]   I'll send you a link.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.540]   I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't say someone, what are these?
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:51.220]   I'm going to post this and having somebody else, you know.
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.780]   Yeah, just had someone do it for him.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:56.020]   And probably talked about it, looked at it, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.580]   I need a memo from my iPhone friends.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.580]   They're all switching to Android.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:59.580]   Help me.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:00.580]   Kind of odd that he put the line in.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.980]   If you're using AT&T, download the visual voicemail app from the Play Store.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:04.980]   That seems like an odd.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.460]   First of all, it comes on all AT&T phones, Eric.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:08.460]   So no need to download.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.060]   I don't know if you buy the Nexus 5.
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.180]   Oh, right.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.700]   So this is aimed at Nexus 5 users, among others.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:18.700]   Okay.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:19.700]   Did get them a lot of press.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:21.700]   Yeah, got a ton of press.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:22.700]   That was a good article though.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:24.700]   I mean it's a good article.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.700]   And kind of thing we would have written.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.700]   I mean it's very how to, helping out to.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.540]   Either way, Google gets all your information.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:29.540]   It's win-win for him.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.420]   Well, no, it really is.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.420]   It really is win-win for him.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:35.220]   They make as much money if not more from iOS users than Android users.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.220]   They can't lose.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.220]   You know what they don't make money from?
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.220]   Blackberry users.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.220]   Eric.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:43.340]   And they have more windows because they don't make money from the app.
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:45.340]   They're almost done with them.
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:50.580]   It's so funny that Google's, Google, the YouTube snake food over the Windows phone.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.580]   It's just bizarre.
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:55.260]   And by the way, the Xbox One ships with a very nice YouTube app on it.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.220]   It's a great way to watch YouTube.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.220]   It's weird.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.220]   Okay.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:05.300]   Leo, one of the things in there that was kind of strange, Fushiki reminded me of it.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:09.540]   He says to download the Visual Voicemail app from AT&T, I think.
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.220]   No, he says from the Android store, from the App Store.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.220]   He says it right.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.540]   Unless this was a fix later.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.140]   He says to download it from the App Store.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:19.140]   That's the weird thing.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:24.460]   The Play Store is filled with carrier-specific apps that every time I try a new device and
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:29.240]   I sync it from my old account, it's like, "Okay, so now I've got Verizon Special Navigator
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.980]   and I've got Sprint Special Voic Styler and I've got..."
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:33.460]   Again, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:38.220]   We're moving slowly towards everybody having their own version of Android to a point where
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:39.700]   it's just different OSs.
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:42.540]   It's a good, you know, it's a power of Babel.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:47.820]   The good news is, in my opinion, the best Android phones are the Google Experience phones.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:49.820]   The Nexus 5 is fabulous.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.660]   I love my Moto X, which just got KitKat.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.860]   I think you're crazy to buy a phone from Samsung at this point.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.460]   It's so junked up.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.060]   It really put me off, Andrew.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.220]   I mean, put me off Samsung.
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:01.220]   It really did.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.820]   There's a next week.
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:07.460]   Hopefully I'll have to finish the next day or two, but I've decided there's so many really
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:12.100]   interesting phones released this year that next Monday I'm running a Phone of the Year
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:14.700]   competition, which I'm naming one.
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:18.820]   But the thing is, what you're saying about Samsung is exactly right.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:23.500]   There are a couple of features I really like about Samsung phones, but now, boy, the other
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:28.180]   hardware makers are doing so much better work in Samsung and in specific handsets that
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.180]   you have to have...
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.140]   There are a couple of good reasons to get a Samsung device, but now you need a reason
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:33.140]   to get a Samsung device.
[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:37.140]   If I could get a Google Edition Note 3 or something like that, I might, because I like
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:38.140]   the...
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:39.140]   I like the Note, but...
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.620]   I wonder how much that is geeks, because a lot of people buy Samsung phones.
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.340]   A lot of them might not even know they're Android phones.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.340]   They just buy Samsung phones.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.340]   Yes.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:47.660]   And it's in Samsung's best interest to make sure their phones look the same and other
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.980]   people's look different so that you'll be more inclined to stick with Samsung.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.620]   That's exactly what Alex is saying, isn't it?
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:52.620]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.620]   Is that...
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.620]   It isn't about Android anymore.
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:55.620]   It's Samsung versus HTC.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:56.620]   They're competitionists other than...
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.540]   Yeah, they want to distinguish themselves.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.460]   And Amazon has distinguished itself.
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.980]   Samsung's distinguished...
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:06.220]   Some people are just limited because they don't want to give away certain features, but I think
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:12.460]   we're seeing with Samsung and Amazon specifically, we're seeing a concerted effort to tweak something
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:16.500]   so that it looks exactly like their environment and not necessarily the Android environment.
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.820]   They don't want it to be the Android environment or to create an environment.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:23.140]   That's really leveraging the difference between Android and iOS.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:28.380]   iOS's strength is consistency that you have one philosophy and one expression of what
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.380]   a phone should be.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.940]   The great thing about Android is that you can have a company like Amazon say, "No, we
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:36.340]   really think the experience should be optimized towards this sort and feature."
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.620]   And I'm saying, I think it's great.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:43.620]   I think that the one thing that we think about, we need to think about is when do we stop saying...
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:48.100]   When we talk about market penetration, when do we stop saying Apple and Android and start
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.100]   saying Apple...
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.100]   Google Android.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.940]   Samsung is already starting to do that.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:52.940]   You know, like, you know, it's...
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:53.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:54.940]   I think it's an irrelevant...
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.420]   It's almost an irrelevant discussion anyway.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:01.860]   If you are concerned about labeling winners and losers, okay, good for you.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:05.900]   If you are a market analyst, nothing that you say needs to be provably right or wrong
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.140]   anyway, so I don't know why you even care about accuracy.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:15.060]   I just like the fact that there are so many great choices for people, including a wonderful
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:21.420]   iPhone, wonderful Android devices, and now, good God, wonderful Windows phone devices.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.340]   What world am I living in right now?
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:28.220]   In which I'm looking...I'm putting a Windows phone back in the box and bring the ship back
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.940]   saying, "By Windows phone, come back soon.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:31.940]   I like you."
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.300]   And to Alex's point, Samsung had their own developers conference a month ago.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:36.700]   It wasn't an Android developers conference.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.780]   It was specifically for Samsung, you know, as DK and Samsung APIs.
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.940]   How far does that connect?
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:46.420]   And the question is, is when do you end up with consumer confusion when people don't
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.860]   understand why they can't download one thing or another?
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.740]   You're really going to have to have completely separate app stores.
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:52.740]   They do.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:53.740]   They have their own apps.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:54.740]   They do.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:56.740]   But it won't be at least something you can't go to Google Play because...
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:02.220]   Well, and that's what Google's fighting, frankly, with its Nexus program and its motor...and
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:04.220]   I think Motorola is going to be a tool in that, too.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:08.100]   Although, they have to be judicious there because Motorola is an OEM.
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:12.740]   I do think that's overstated, though, because again, I try at least one new Android phone
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:17.420]   every month, and again, usually I start off by just re-syncing to my reference account.
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.420]   So nice, isn't it?
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:19.420]   Exactly.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:24.580]   I'll try it stock the way it comes out of the box, but once I say, "Okay, make this phone
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:29.020]   look like my own Android phone," it doesn't matter what maker model it is.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:32.540]   It will have my launcher, it will have my keyboard, it will have my desktop wallpaper,
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:37.820]   it will have all the little enhancements that are Google Play store standard.
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.180]   So it's cool that you can actually choose your own software experience and choose your
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.340]   own hardware experience.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.420]   I don't think there's a whole lot of...
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:47.620]   You need to have an HTC phone to make this work or you need to have a Samsung phone to
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.620]   make this work.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:51.700]   Google's so smart that they're taking back ownership not by making their own phone only,
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:55.180]   but by making so many things tied to Google Play services that it behooves you to use
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:57.620]   those things and the value lives in there.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.620]   That's such a big deal.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:04.700]   Now that they've released things like, "Okay, we will now release the Google Play experience
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:08.980]   keyboard so that now every single device can use it."
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:14.380]   They're basically saying, "We have tried this idea where we let manufacturers do whatever
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.780]   they want with Android.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:18.580]   That didn't work out great for us, so we're going to make sure that we can make even
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:24.460]   the crappiest, crappiest blister pack, cheapo, Android phone have actual good interface
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:26.220]   and actual usability."
[01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:31.580]   I just got the Kindle Fire HDX, the 8.9 inch.
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:33.060]   It's very impressive by the way.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   It's great.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:39.020]   It's a better screen than the iPad Air.
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.100]   It's lighter than the iPad.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.300]   It's 69, which always is a little weird.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:46.540]   It's Android, but not really because it's got the Amazon.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.540]   Although the Amazon's got...
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:48.900]   It's Mojito, Leo.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.380]   It's got Fire OS.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:52.780]   Fire OS has gotten better and better and better, I have to say.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.780]   I didn't like it all the way much.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.780]   Oh, name, Mojito.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.780]   Or a Smokito is better.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:59.500]   So, Leo, I know the specs on the HDX are better than the iPad Air.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.660]   When you're actually using it, is it something that you notice or is it just spec-wise you're
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:04.660]   thinking?
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:05.660]   You can notice it if you pay attention to it.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:10.420]   It's specs, but I immediately noticed what a good-looking screen it is.
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.180]   I mean, it really is a good-looking screen.
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:14.060]   That technology, unfortunately, is small batch still.
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.340]   You can't make 100 million of those screens, but Amazon, to their advantage is you're
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.340]   making them for the ones that they can have.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.860]   It's still a consumption device.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.740]   It's not much more than the iPad is.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:27.300]   It really is a door into Amazon.
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:28.300]   But I loved it.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.300]   All my audio, Audible.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:31.660]   It comes Leo's Kindle.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:37.420]   Leo's seventh Kindle, it said.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.020]   By the way, it's far more than that.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.580]   That's what they gave it the name of.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:44.540]   Then it has all my Audible books.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:47.580]   The library is not downloaded, but the library is there.
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.620]   There's an audiobooks tab and it's there.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.180]   All my Amazon stuff there.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:55.580]   Does it do anything you can't do with Ripehead?
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.220]   Yes.
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:03.940]   Mostly in the content area of it, they've got the X-ray feature that is marvelous for
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   watching video.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.580]   The May Day thing where you can meet chicks.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:08.580]   That's cool.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.580]   You can call Leo.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.580]   What is the X-ray thing, Andy?
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:15.020]   How many times have you been watching a movie or TV show?
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.020]   That's a good song.
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:18.460]   I want to buy or I wonder who wrote that.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:23.140]   Or you see somebody in an old movie and say, "Wait, was that guy in this other movie too?"
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:27.460]   With X-ray, the movie will still play, but if you tap this button, there'll be an overlay
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:30.500]   that will tell you, "Oh, the song that's playing right now, here's the title, here's
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.340]   the artist, if you want to buy it, go here and you're birdfiring."
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:34.460]   So you don't need to flip over to IMDB then?
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:36.020]   You don't need to do it.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:40.900]   The cool thing is that you will actually have like, it's almost like a role-playing game
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.140]   in that every time a new character enters the scene, a little thumbnail of that character
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:46.140]   appears.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:49.660]   Here's the person's name, here's the actors playing it, tap that button, it will show
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.140]   you, "Oh, here's the other movies."
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.780]   It's kind of like that.
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:55.580]   Well, not only that, but it's connected to IMDB.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:00.460]   So again, if you want this content, it will also give you trivia that goes shot for shot
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:01.460]   by shot.
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:05.980]   It's not quite as good as saying, "Okay, take a look at that red drum in the background
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:09.780]   because that was also like in a previous scene that supposedly happened 50 years ago in
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:10.780]   a different country."
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:13.380]   It's not quite as good as that, but all it is.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   It's not anything next to you.
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:20.140]   But the answer a little bit to what you were talking about with this Android kind of bifurcation
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:24.260]   of Android is that I think really ultimately what's happening is we're living in ecosystems.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:28.180]   So this is for the Amazon ecosystem liver.
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.740]   iPad is for the Apple ecosystem.
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.980]   Samsung is really for the Samsung ecosystem.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:38.660]   And I think Samsung and these other companies aren't as good as ecosystems as Apple is,
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.100]   as Google is, and as Amazon is.
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:45.780]   So I think ultimately it's going to come down to people who create a good ecosystem.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:50.540]   And because I watch, I mostly buy movies on Amazon because it works on a broad variety,
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:53.140]   including the iPad of devices that I use.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:57.060]   So when I bought the Sopranos, I could have bought it in various places, but I bought
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:01.100]   it on Amazon because I would be able to watch it in the most places, including now.
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:04.740]   And I buy it on iTunes because most of my stuff is that I'm using it in a base.
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:08.940]   This feels constricting because I can't do it on my Roku, I can't do it on my Chromecast,
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:12.860]   I can't do it on my TV, which has many of my TVs are smart TVs.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:16.020]   I can't do it on my Kindle, but I can't.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.380]   So in other words, it's only Apple, right?
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.940]   And so to me that makes the decision a little bit.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.940]   And for some people that's problematic.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.940]   Well, it is.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:26.580]   Amazon, I use Amazon Music.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.300]   My whole library is on Amazon Music.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.300]   It's very nice.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.140]   All my library is there.
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.820]   It's sort of like developing on Flash versus developing on Xcode where one is horizontal
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.820]   and one is vertical.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.780]   You can buy stuff vertically on iTunes or horizontally on Amazon, but both are a lock-in.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.780]   You're locked into Amazon.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.420]   And if one day they have a big disagreement with a certain vendor and poll content or get
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.900]   pushed off, you're still as liable.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:49.140]   But for right now, if you have a lot of devices, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:53.740]   Somebody in the show said they like the immersion reading on the Kindle, but now Android KitKat
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.580]   has immersion reading as well.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.380]   So that's where all the controls go away, your full screen.
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.780]   I like the listening reading.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.620]   I have to say the HDX is really nice.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:08.620]   I like the first fire, but it had issues that kept me from saying this is a good buy.
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:10.540]   I'm changing my attitude on this thing.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:11.540]   This is a really nice issue.
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.540]   Still mostly US only though, sadly.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.700]   Yeah, it's only available in two countries.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.900]   All right, let's do our picks of the week.
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.740]   I think we're ready to wrap this up.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:25.180]   And since Alison is our guest of the week, let's let you start from nozilla cast, Alison
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.180]   Sheridan.
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:30.940]   All right, so I know you like to keep things really crisp and short here, Leo, but I'm
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.940]   going to--
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.940]   No, no, that's so untrue.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   Go ahead.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:36.700]   So much so that I believe you're being sarcastic, yes.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:37.700]   It's possible.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.700]   It's possible.
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.700]   I have two picks.
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.100]   The first one I want to do is a hardware pick.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:45.380]   So Steve bought me the iPod, the new iPhone dock.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.780]   Let's see if I can get that up where anybody can see it.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.500]   It's a nice little dock.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:54.620]   It's only 29 bucks, except it doesn't come with the lightning cable, which means you
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.700]   have to buy what a $20 lightning cable.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.220]   So when you're done with this thing, it's about 30 bucks.
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.300]   And you have to take your phone out of the case to stick it in here.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.260]   And when you put it in, it stands almost perfectly straight up.
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.780]   Oh, he's getting ahead of me.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.980]   So what I got next was the Sydoku.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:15.940]   Let's see, my pronounce here, Sydoka from RadTech.
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.260]   And this allows you to put it in--
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.620]   Put your iPhone into the dock in a case.
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.620]   Lying down.
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:22.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:25.220]   And you can also line down, which is really nice because you can actually tap on it and
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.980]   play with it when it's in the dock.
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:32.180]   And it's got really sticky little feet on the bottom, so it stays still so you want
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:33.180]   to yank.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.180]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.420]   So when you want to yank your phone out, you can yank it out.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.260]   So it's 50 bucks.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:43.260]   But the other one is 30 plus 20, which I think is 50, again, when you're done.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:46.220]   So I'm really happy with it.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.260]   It uses a micro USB cable that actually comes with it.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.260]   Wow.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.460]   I really like this case and are this dock.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.740]   And like I said, you can yank the phone out and it doesn't pull it off your desk.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.740]   That's nice.
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:00.580]   So it uses a micro USB, but it has a lightning in the case itself.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:06.740]   And I have the Apple case, the product red case, and it fits in there just fine.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:09.580]   If you have a giant case, it's not going to fit in there.
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.820]   But a moderate case, it still will fit.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:12.820]   Oh, look.
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:14.420]   And you can take the rubber out.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:16.420]   So they're showing a T with the other case.
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:17.420]   What's the rubber for?
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.420]   Just so it could just--
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.420]   That's if you don't have a case.
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:20.420]   Oh, I see.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:21.420]   The rubber takes a place of a case.
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.420]   I get it.
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:24.420]   Wow.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.420]   That's nicely done.
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.420]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:27.420]   Yeah, red tech.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:28.420]   Very definitely cool.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:31.420]   So my software pick is-- I got to put a disclaimer on it.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:35.620]   I actually advertise for these guys, but they are not paying me right now to do it.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:40.420]   The audience of Mac Break Weekly and most Twitch shows are really sophisticated users.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:44.500]   So I'm guessing all of you help other people with their computers, with their Macs, with
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.100]   their PCs, whatever it is.
[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:47.100]   You're always helping them.
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.420]   And you're having to answer the same questions over and over and over again.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:55.260]   The software I'm in love with is called Clarify from Clarify-it.com.
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:59.340]   And it's a tool that lets you take a bunch of screenshots really quickly, throw in some
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.340]   annotations.
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:05.100]   You can put little sequence numbers in, arrows, text, put some text around it, and then publish
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:09.020]   it either to the web or to create a PDF or throw it into Evernote.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:13.820]   And it allows you to send instructions to people, keep them, and make sure that you
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.740]   only answer every tech question once.
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:17.740]   I'm not phrased by this.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:19.380]   I've got tons of tutorials on it.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:21.820]   So when people ask you tech questions, you send them screenshots.
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:22.820]   You're very nice.
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.820]   Well, yeah.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:24.820]   Well, I do the things.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.820]   That's awesome.
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:27.020]   A lot of times they'll do it for myself.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.260]   And then somebody else asks me for it.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:31.700]   So I save a lot of time by doing it.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.740]   Now I use Skitch right now, which is the free Evernote.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:35.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.500]   How does it compare to Skitch?
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.340]   Skitch is just a single screenshot.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.180]   This allows you to create a little tutorial.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.700]   If you go to Podfeet.com in the menu bar, there's a link to tutorials.
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:48.940]   And every single one of those I've created with Skitch or their other product screen
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:50.500]   steps.
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:51.500]   There's a Mac version.
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.780]   There's a Windows version.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.140]   There's a Sliders version of the software.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.660]   So if you go back and forth, you can have both.
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:59.540]   But it's a bunch of steps.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.460]   It's for more complex things.
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:05.100]   Sometimes I'll use Skitch to just throw a single screenshot up.
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.060]   But it also, you can store them all in Evernote.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.500]   So tutorials for yourself.
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:12.220]   So things I forget, I'll often just throw them up in Evernote.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:17.420]   So yeah, if you see there's a tutorial tab there right under where it says Mac up there,
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:18.420]   right there.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:22.980]   All of those I've created using screen steps or clarify depending on which tool I was
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:24.540]   using at the time.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.540]   That's cool.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:26.740]   Not how to wax a card, not that one.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.580]   I knew you'd come back.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.020]   How to wax a car.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.780]   Yeah, it's screenshots.
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.060]   So I might have to buy it.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.780]   How much is clarify?
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:36.780]   I knew you'd ask me that.
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:39.020]   I think it's 40.
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:40.620]   Is it on the App Store or is it?
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.620]   Clarify.
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.140]   It's an App Store version, but I wouldn't encourage you to do that right now because
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.700]   you're about to come out with a new version.
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:49.860]   And since Apple doesn't allow you to upgrade pricing, I would buy it from Clarify-it.com
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.700]   right now or wait till Clarify 3 comes out.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.820]   It's going to be a pretty major upgrade.
[01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:58.300]   This is such a problem with the App Store because I like to buy in the App Store because
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:00.180]   it's so easy to set up a new computer.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:04.700]   But at the same time, so maybe I'll wait until version 3.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.700]   Is that imminent?
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.580]   Yeah, it's pretty soon.
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:10.420]   They haven't given a date on it yet, but it's, oh good.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:12.660]   We brought Clarify-it.com down.
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:13.660]   We did.
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:14.660]   We cut the site.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.860]   Maybe we want to tell them about Squarespace.
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:16.860]   Squarespace.com.
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:20.740]   Andy and I go, thank you, Allison.
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.740]   Great picks.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:22.740]   I'm going to buy the Clarify.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.900]   That looks really good.
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:27.260]   And I want to get the RadTech.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.980]   So there you got two, both sold.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:30.980]   Sold.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:31.980]   Here you go.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:32.980]   What do you got, Andy?
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:36.580]   My pick is something that I think you mentioned a couple of weeks ago, but I got my pre-release
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.780]   copy just last week.
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:41.180]   It is the massive cool tools.
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.060]   Easy and this awesome.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:47.620]   This is like, here's my mail sorting procedure.
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:51.260]   I'll come home or I'll come downstairs for the first time.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:54.740]   I'll see a couple of packages on my doorstep and I'll just do a quick triage and put them
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:55.820]   someplace.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.380]   This one, I didn't know what was in the package.
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:45:59.740]   I opened it up and I saw this.
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:00.740]   Oh, that's right.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.060]   They were going to send me this one.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:07.020]   Twenty minutes later, I was still at my front step and my socks and my pajamas put the door
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:09.940]   open because I was looking at so many things.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:17.620]   This is just a contendium of highly recommended individual products, ideas, tools, services
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:22.700]   and things that have been recommended on that really great cool tools site, kk.org.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.860]   I'm coming Kelly's site.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:29.420]   And every, it's the most browsable physical object.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.420]   That's great.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.820]   I took it up because I knew I was going to be using this as a pick of the week and you know,
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:39.500]   what I was talking, I was flipping through and every single page I get to, I was stopping
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:47.380]   and reading some more because here are two pages on camping and travel stuff and I'm like,
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:55.300]   so wow, here's a really cool $40 travel sheet that's like a portable sleeping bag that's
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.780]   packed into a small queue.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:57.780]   Oh, wow.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.860]   I've never thought about actually having parachute cord and here's a little article explaining
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:06.220]   why parachute cord is much more interesting and wow, here's a, I didn't know that they
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:11.740]   make like these little tents, these tents that you put on the top of your car and turn your
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:12.740]   car into a camera.
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:14.740]   It's really the whole catalog back.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:15.740]   Exactly.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.100]   And you know the QR codes too.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.100]   The QR codes.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:21.740]   It sounds like typing in, instead of typing in the URL to where do you go to buy this or
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:22.740]   what more about this?
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:24.220]   There's just, there's just a QR code.
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:26.540]   You just, there's that raising rapids book.
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.740]   Do you have the natural goat care book?
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:29.740]   No.
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:30.980]   Did you know this is a good rear-end and utter?
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.820]   This is a cow-hocks and divided utter.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.820]   I didn't know that actually.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:39.740]   So well attached, and this is a poorly attached, and pendulous and uneven.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:44.220]   That is something you don't learn these days in the modern world.
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.220]   I thought we could make it through Leo.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.220]   Nothing.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:49.220]   Like that.
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:51.540]   How about slowly your own mineral water?
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:54.300]   How about how to make your own mineral water?
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:55.300]   Huh?
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:56.300]   I've got all things to buy.
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:59.860]   It's also, here's a technique that really, really works for splitting wood.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.860]   And here's-
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.860]   So, so.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:02.860]   And so.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:05.700]   This is, what I, the best recommendation I can give for this is that-
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:06.700]   I have it.
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:10.260]   I remember like as a little kid when it's the holidays and you're being dragged to like
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:14.220]   relatives' houses and you don't really know them, but your parents know these people very,
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:15.220]   very well.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.820]   So you're stuck here for four and a half hours and they don't have a game console.
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:19.580]   They don't really have the kids to play with.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.900]   So you start like, okay, they've got readers digest.
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:24.820]   I guess I'll sort of like look at the jokes.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:28.380]   If this had been like on the coffee table in one of those houses, they would have had
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:31.940]   to drag me away from that house because it was just nothing but page after page of things
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:35.540]   I'd never heard of but became immensely fascinating.
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:36.700]   This is a very expensive book.
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.260]   I don't mean that it's expensive.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.260]   It's expensive.
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.260]   It's not expensive to buy.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.260]   It's expensive to use.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.220]   A lot of buy the world-
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:44.220]   That Barnabas is awesome.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:45.220]   I have it.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:46.220]   These are all colors pages.
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:47.220]   It's 40 bucks.
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:50.340]   I think it's, I checked on the official link.
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:54.780]   It's an Amazon link and it's on pre-order and I believe it'll ship very, very soon.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:58.540]   This would be the best Christmas present for everybody in your family.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:48:59.540]   I'm so serious.
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:02.940]   You'll, you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll come, if you, if you give this to someone at the
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:07.380]   start of the Christmas party, I guarantee you it will never be closed and put away for
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:11.220]   the rest of the Christmas party because someone is going to be, again, it's, it's, it's like
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.700]   the Sarlacc pit of interesting articles.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.900]   It's like you think you're getting a little bit closer but then you'll get drawn right
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.340]   into it and you will never escape it.
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.140]   I, there's something on every page I want to buy.
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:22.140]   This in the bathroom with an iPhone is expensive.
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:24.340]   Do you have to keep on costing?
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:26.820]   So we're going to Kevin Kelly self-publish this.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.980]   That's what's so amazing about it.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:28.980]   I think you mentioned that.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:29.980]   That's amazing.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:30.980]   Right.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.420]   And then it doesn't, this does not look like a, you know, self-published project.
[01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:35.460]   It is, it's beautiful.
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:38.940]   I like it when I open a book and I smell the ink, the color ink.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.860]   I just, it's fabulous.
[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:42.900]   You smell the internship.
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:43.900]   This is something everybody should immediately.
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:47.300]   I got to stand out more now because we're so used to not having them.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.300]   Right.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:52.780]   It's, it's random access that you really like because the, on the, on the web, you can
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.660]   find whatever you, you think of and you search for.
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.420]   It's really, really hard to find something.
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.420]   Serendipity.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:03.660]   And this is like hundreds of pages of serendipitous discoveries.
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.660]   Hose connectors.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:06.300]   With QR codes.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:08.300]   Soil testers.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:11.260]   Brom squirrel buster bird feeder.
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.500]   Bust those squirrels.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.260]   I, I literally every page through some of them.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:19.260]   No, I was.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.740]   So Kevin's going to join us on a triangulation and a few, probably some time.
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:25.020]   Early next year to talk about this.
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.180]   But I agree with you, Andy.
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:27.820]   And what a good gift this would be.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:28.820]   Yes.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:29.820]   The gift that keeps on taking.
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:30.820]   Exactly.
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.980]   About to say, about a little.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:38.220]   Or better yet, like buy a copy for yourself and use that as like a feeder for the next
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:39.220]   five years.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.220]   Right.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:44.660]   Well, this is the perfect gadget because I'm always calling artichokes and always complain.
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.020]   How did you find this perfect tool for it?
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.820]   Like, well, you know, I pay attention to you and your needs.
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:56.020]   And I, I asked around the artichoke calling community and I just feel like this is Kevin
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.020]   Kelly's masterwork.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:58.540]   He says so many great things.
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:50:59.900]   This is like the curated skymull.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.100]   Like the one that wasn't just someone paying to be in there.
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:05.940]   It's like, it's like, it's like stuff where it's not kooky.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.020]   It's just if he never did anything ever else again.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.380]   He may not have to make him the hominology.
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:12.700]   It's a site in culture.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:16.900]   Now, this question is, does the QR code take you to Amazon and give him 4% back?
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:18.900]   I would if I did it.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:19.900]   Sure.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:20.900]   It doesn't say.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:23.900]   It just says a QR code is a hyperlink.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.780]   I don't know if to scan some.
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:30.060]   I think I scanned a couple and it took me to like the official, like the canonical products
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:31.060]   I forgot.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.260]   I hope he gets a backend on it.
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.260]   Well, he's getting, yeah.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:35.820]   I mean, 40 bucks probably just barely covering the cost of this.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:37.780]   This is a beautiful full color.
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:39.620]   As a business model, that would be excellent.
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:43.340]   But this is the whole earth catalog, but only in four colors and beautiful.
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:46.780]   And I think Kevin Kelly is one of the most lovable people in the world.
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:47.780]   I just had to work.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:48.780]   It's a whole key catalog.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:49.780]   Yes.
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:53.260]   And by the way, done on a Mac G5.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.020]   So how about that?
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.020]   Wow.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:52:14.900]   It's a source for a
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.500]   something missing in that comment.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.860]   But all right, they wouldn't have any Macs.
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:24.260]   Although if it turns out if you're honest, you can have a cell phone if you're on a skitter.
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:26.300]   I'm wondering.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.140]   Many of the QR codes in this book were to Amazon because almost everything is available on
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:32.300]   Amazon.
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:34.260]   And he is using Amazon.
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:36.060]   Well played referral codes.
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:37.540]   And I would hope he would.
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:39.540]   That's like, it costs us nothing.
[01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:41.860]   We went through all the trouble of figuring that thing out.
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:45.420]   I'm happy to make sure that I.
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:46.420]   That's good.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.420]   Good idea.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:48.420]   So use the QR code.
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:50.340]   He could become quite wealthy if you all do that.
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:51.340]   Yes.
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:52.340]   Use the QR.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.340]   Don't just search an Amazon for it.
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:54.340]   Use the QR code.
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:55.900]   Everyone buys the yacht on page 37.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:58.220]   He'll be a millionaire.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:00.220]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:03.020]   So as you may know, I travel a lot.
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:04.020]   What?
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.020]   I know.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.020]   I just wanted to believe.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.660]   But I spent a lot of time on a flight.
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:12.300]   And I just wanted to point out that are you in Star Alliance or are you on?
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:13.900]   I am a Star Alliance card carrier.
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:16.140]   Who do you mostly fall fly on?
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.140]   Mostly United.
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:18.140]   Because that's-
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:19.140]   Can you use the United app?
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:20.140]   Yeah, of course.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.140]   It is awesome.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:22.140]   It's very good.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:23.140]   So I just want to go on off because it's what everyone-
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.140]   Yeah, it's a textbook though, right?
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.140]   No, no, no, no.
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:26.140]   There's the United app.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:27.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.900]   So there's a- so the application that United came out with, it's just that all the other
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:32.460]   airlines, you know, chain one, you know, and you know, it's an app.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:34.500]   I know, but this one works so well.
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.500]   And I have to admit.
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.500]   So I can go in here and I have-
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.500]   Wow.
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:38.500]   Yeah, I know it's pretty.
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:41.740]   It just got updated and it is- Brian, do we have it over the shoulder?
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.300]   He's working on it, I think, for you.
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:45.300]   Alex looks over.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:46.940]   You're a little PTZ.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.940]   What?
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.940]   Is mine?
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:49.940]   I'll show it.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.580]   I put a little post this on my camera.
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:52.820]   Just show it and I'll show it.
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:55.700]   So anyway, so the- So it's smart boy.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.700]   Look at that.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:58.700]   It's good.
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.700]   I'll just put my thumb there too.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:00.700]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:01.700]   So anyway, so then if you-
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.700]   If you click on that tip, welcome back Alexander.
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:04.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.700]   And then, okay.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:11.340]   So the thing is that you can- What's kind of cool about it is, you know, you can-
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.180]   I can look at my flights, I can check in.
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:14.180]   Shim and the Christmas.
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.220]   You got a quarter million miles in here.
[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:17.220]   That's just this year.
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.940]   You're a- You're a premier 1K traveler.
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:22.020]   So anyway, the- I can't really see any of that because it's so-
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:23.020]   Right, but this is pretty-
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.700]   Anyway, but the thing is I can look at it, I can request upgrades, I can move my seats,
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:32.060]   I can change flights, I can- So you can really do everything that you would do, you know,
[01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:33.060]   that you would call someone for-
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:34.060]   Your art maps?
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:35.060]   That's cool.
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:39.420]   I mean, it's really- I mean, they really went like, okay, we're going to not just do something
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:41.420]   where you kind of check in or do something basic.
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:46.340]   We're really going to give you all the tools you need to, you know, to actually, you know,
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.060]   interact with United.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.060]   And anyway-
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:50.060]   And you're even-
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.060]   Those are boarding passes.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.060]   Those are boarding passes.
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:54.060]   I don't know if there's any- There's probably not anything right now.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:55.060]   No, there's nothing right here.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.060]   But the- That's cool.
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:58.620]   But yeah, you can have all your boarding passes in there.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:04.340]   And so you- I go to- I send them the passbook from here out of habit, but the reality is
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:08.460]   I now just use the app most of the time instead of passbook because it's just easier and-
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:11.860]   So this is not- They do have a passbook app, but this is not that.
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:15.820]   No, so you can send it from this app to- To the passbook.
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:16.820]   To the passbook.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:17.820]   It'll let you do that really easily.
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:18.820]   Okay.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.820]   But this is so good.
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:21.540]   It's actually so much better than passbook that you don't bother.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:24.740]   You just- When that little piece is there, you hit the little plus sign, it gets bigger,
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.620]   it's got all the information and it's- I have it on my phone because I have a, you know,
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.300]   I have all the passbook apps.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:36.060]   This is the one I'm sure United offers to go with passbook.
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:39.900]   It is, but it's- But that's the one- But that's the one- But that's- But that's the one- But don't use passbook is what you're saying.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:40.900]   You don't need it.
[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:41.900]   You don't need it.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:42.900]   You just use the app, the United one.
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:43.900]   So it's great.
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:44.900]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:48.220]   You can see a lot of- You can see all the- You can buy tickets, you can- And the interface,
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:49.860]   it's not just that you can do it.
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.100]   It's that you can do it easily.
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.560]   And it's really- It's really well done.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.700]   And it's just, anyway, that's all.
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:56.460]   Okay, that's it.
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:57.460]   That's it.
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:58.460]   It was great.
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.460]   I'm done.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:00.460]   That's all you need.
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:02.020]   All right, United Airlines app.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:06.060]   And finally, Renee, Richie, and your pick of the week, sir.
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.140]   I've got two as well.
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:08.260]   One software, one hardware.
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:11.180]   The first is Procreate version two shipped yesterday.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.180]   I love Procreation.
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:19.180]   Oh, no, that's not where- This is a drawing and painting app where the iPad made by Savage Interactive.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:23.180]   It is the pro- My favorite pro drawing app on the iPad.
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.180]   It's just fantastic.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:27.020]   They have layers, brushes, opacity.
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:31.100]   If you like, I mean, paper is a good app, but you have almost no control over the various
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:32.100]   elements.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.940]   This is a full-fledged, fledged artistic suite that lets you do pretty much- I mean, you
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:39.860]   can see from the examples pretty much anything that you can imagine.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:43.100]   And it's got a 64-bit support now, 4K Canvas support.
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.340]   It's got a whole bunch of new- It's got layers.
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.100]   Yeah, layers, GPU-accelerated filters now.
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:51.300]   It's got an iOS 7 redesign.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:55.860]   Everyone I know who just loves to do art on an iPad absolutely loves- Yeah, and it won
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:57.300]   an Apple design award.
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.300]   The guys at Savage Interactive very well deserved.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.020]   They also make a pen to go with it.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:05.340]   Well, it supports all the Bluetooth 4.0 styluses, yeah.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.700]   Which is the only way to do pressure sensitivity on the iPad right now is to have Bluetooth
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.700]   4.0.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.700]   Does that Bluetooth actually work?
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:12.700]   Ish.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.500]   I mean, if you're used to a Wacom, it is not the same thing.
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.180]   Because I spent years on a Wacom, sir, this is no Wacom.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:23.100]   But if you're used to an iPad stylus, it does give you more possibilities than the usual
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.540]   dumb iPad styluses do.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:30.420]   Some of the images that they have from it are amazing.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.420]   Unbelievable.
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.900]   And it works really well.
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:34.900]   Wow.
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:37.660]   Procreate, how much?
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.340]   So it's $6, at least $5.99.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:40.340]   But the update is free.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.620]   If you have Procreate 1, for some reason, which I still am upset about, they did not
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.620]   charge for the update.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:45.620]   They should.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.580]   I would have paid 40 bucks for the update.
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.580]   That's a good deal.
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:54.340]   Because if you want to get, even if you are using, which I'm going to call it, the other
[01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:55.340]   one.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.340]   I mentioned paper.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.100]   It's like eight or nine bucks to get all the tools.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:00.620]   So this is a good deal.
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:01.620]   Absolutely.
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:03.620]   I mean, this is the best money I've ever spent on art supplies in my life.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.380]   It's just absolutely fantastic.
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.220]   Less than the cost of a single chalk pencil box.
[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:10.220]   Wow.
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:11.220]   Create it.
[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:13.620]   Procreate.si if you want to know more.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.900]   Yeah, and available on the App Store.
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.540]   It's iPad only, but you'd really want.
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:19.500]   And it makes the iPad era phenomenal artistic tool.
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.500]   $5.99.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:21.500]   Nido.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.660]   I can't draw it.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.500]   I'm going to still buy it.
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:25.900]   The other one I wanted to mention was.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:26.900]   I do.
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:27.900]   I do.
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.900]   I do.
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.580]   Paddin Quill makes these, you know, hipster moleskin cases.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:31.580]   This is a new one.
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:35.300]   They just put out for the iPad air and you can open it up.
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:39.220]   They've made them for iPads for a long time and you've got all your stuff inside it and
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:42.220]   you can use various, you know, stand positions.
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:46.820]   But they've just put out a new series of bags, bags and sleeves as their new line.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:49.820]   And they're using artisans in various places to make them.
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:51.580]   Some of them sign their own bags.
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.820]   It's available on the website now.
[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:55.740]   They have the messenger, the full size bag.
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.740]   They're expensive, but like all their products, they're handcrafted and they all work well
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:00.740]   together.
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:04.260]   So when you look at them, you can have your iPad in its case, your MacBook and its sleeve.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.780]   It all goes into the bag.
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.740]   And the degree of craft that they put into these.
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:09.740]   These are beautiful.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:10.740]   Gorgeous products.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:13.620]   This is the most expensive part of the show for me.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.140]   It's Brian and Carrie.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:16.620]   They're a couple from Minnesota.
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:18.900]   They really care about the work they're doing.
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:20.300]   Brian and Carrie Holmes.
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.140]   They do fantastic stuff.
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:25.740]   They're always really excited about new products that come out because they want to make fantastic
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:26.900]   stuff to go with them.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:32.540]   I just got their new iPhone cases and they came with little brown paper with seals put
[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:36.140]   on them, you know, hand sealed.
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:38.460]   And that's just an example of, it's the same thing, Johnny.
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:42.540]   I've talked about in that video where humans like the idea that their objects they buy
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:43.540]   are cared for.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:47.100]   We know when something's cheap and when no one really cared about making it.
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:50.380]   And we also know when someone put a lot of time and effort and love into making these
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:52.100]   things.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:55.460]   And that's the kind of feeling I get when I look at our seasonal products like this.
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:58.660]   That someone really sweated the details and made something that will last more than a
[01:59:58.660 --> 01:59:59.660]   year if I buy it.
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:04.180]   I'm ordering right now from my iPad mini.
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:05.740]   Just gorgeous.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:06.740]   Just gorgeous.
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:10.580]   When I travel, if I'm only taking my iPad, I put it in one of these cases and put it
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:12.700]   under my arm like a book and just it's fantastic.
[02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:15.620]   Yeah, nobody knows you've got a expensive device.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:18.740]   They just think they're carrying around a silly little tab.
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:19.740]   Nope pad.
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:20.740]   They're an expensive case.
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:21.740]   They just don't know.
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:22.740]   They're buying what's inside.
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:26.180]   Yeah, I'm thinking like the latest aluminum and glass technology and wrapping it in something
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:29.740]   that's as old as bookbinding and Italian leather and birch.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:32.500]   It feels like that duality is just really nice.
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.380]   I love it that my I have a three letter name.
[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:39.300]   So when people ask for a monogramming, I can get my name on it.
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.020]   Somebody said that's tech.
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:44.380]   They all say Leo, you should have your initials, but I don't know.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.380]   I like it.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:46.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:47.380]   I have a three letter name.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.820]   I'm going to take advantage of it.
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:53.180]   Hey, what do you want from me?
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:54.180]   Good pick.
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:55.180]   You're right.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:56.180]   This is the most expensive part of the show.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:59.460]   I just spent $100 on anything that you mentioned.
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.460]   Yes.
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:01.460]   That's at www.tattinkwill.com.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.460]   www.tattinkwill.com.
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.460]   www.tattinkwill.com.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.460]   Thank you so much Renee Richie.
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:05.460]   www.imore.com.
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:09.620]   If you want to know more, anything you want to plug Renee?
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:13.740]   Tomorrow I'm sitting down with Don Melton again who he made web kit for Apple and Safari
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:18.780]   for Apple and now he's retired and he's working on H.264 transcoding of all things.
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:23.060]   So he's going to go over the various ways that you can take all your beloved videos
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:26.860]   and put them on your computer with the best quality possible.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:27.860]   Neat.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.700]   He's an amazing guy.
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:32.420]   Leo, can I suck up to Renee for a minute?
[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:34.020]   Yeah, please suck up to Renee.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:37.340]   I just want to say Renee, I think you're a fantastic addition to the show.
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:41.580]   I really like having you on regularly and not just because I'm on now, but just want
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.900]   to say something nice to you publicly.
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:43.900]   I agree.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:44.900]   I agree.
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:46.460]   And so for you, Alison Sheridan.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:47.460]   He's blushing.
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:48.460]   I'm going to be on the website.

[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:28.460]   Thank you, Mr. Alex Lizzie.
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:29.460]   Nice to have you here for a change.
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.460]   Come back soon.
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:31.460]   I'll do the best I can.
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:38.460]   I'll be in a later next week, but I'll be the best I can to come out soon.
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:42.460]   We're going to be looking for more local producers all over the world.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:44.460]   Definitely follow me on Twitter.
[02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:47.460]   Twitter and G+ those are the two places to follow me.
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:53.460]   We're going to be doing a concerted effort in December to identify more people to work
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:54.460]   with us.
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:04:00.460]   So if you've got spare cycles, then you like video and audio and the internet.
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:02.460]   There you go.
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:06.460]   Follow me on Twitter and follow me on G+ while we send out forms and stuff like that for
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:07.460]   people to fill out.
[02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:08.460]   There you go.
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:10.460]   It's if the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise.
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:11.460]   Thank you, Chatham.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.460]   I think that's about it for this show.
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:19.460]   If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise, we'll be back next Tuesday, 11am Pacific,
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:23.460]   2pm Eastern Time 1900 UTC on Twits.tv.
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.460]   Love it if you can watch live.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:28.460]   If you'd like to be part of our live studio audience and we have a good number here today,
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.460]   welcome to all of you.
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:33.460]   You can email tickets at twit.tv and if you get here early, you get the comfortable chair.
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:34.460]   Yes.
[02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.460]   And there's only a few of those.
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:37.460]   The rest of you just going to have to.
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:39.460]   The rest of you are going to get a stool.
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:42.460]   Well, it's not the most comfortable chairs ever.
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:44.460]   They haven't taken the comfortable chairs.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.460]   See, they had the comfortable chairs in the back.
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:47.460]   They wanted to sit up front.
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:48.460]   That's what we do.
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.460]   You get a comfortable chair and no view.
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.460]   See, this is an audience of overachievers.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:53.460]   You know, these are all at all.
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:54.460]   They sit in the front and the front row.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:56.460]   They didn't show up here, yeah, exactly.
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:57.460]   Man, that's amazing.
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.460]   Very nice to have you.
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.460]   You can also get, go ahead.
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:05.460]   Just hoping that someone's Skype feed goes out and they need, just like that kid who goes
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:08.460]   to the ballpark with a mitt in the cap saying, "Put me in the game.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:09.460]   Put me in coach.
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:13.460]   I'm ready to play today."
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:14.460]   We do this show on Tuesdays.
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:18.460]   As I mentioned, if you can't watch live though, you can always get on to made audio and video
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:19.460]   effect.
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:25.460]   That's at twit.tv/mbw or wherever finer net casts are aggregated and delivered to your
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:28.460]   device, such as iTunes.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:29.460]   Thanks for being here.
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:30.460]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:32.460]   Now get back to work because you know what?
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.460]   Breakdown is over.
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:34.460]   That's what I say.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.460]   It's over.
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.460]   It's over.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:37.460]   It's over.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:38.460]   You can't be here no more.
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:45.460]   [Music]
