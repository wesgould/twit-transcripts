[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.580]   Hey, everyone.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.080]   Welcome back to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.280]   This is Alex Lindsey-Sitt and in for Leo, who is in LA covering E3.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.920]   In fact, we're going to be jumping to-- for those
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.480]   of you watching live, we're going to be jumping to E3
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.240]   a little bit later at noon as it opens.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.360]   Leo is going to be covering that.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.560]   And so it should be a lot of fun.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.600]   But of course, we're going to stick to Macintosh
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.760]   for the next hour or so.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.240]   So joining me today, we've got Andy Anotko.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.520]   Hey, Andy.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.720]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120]   And it's good to see you.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.160]   We're just here.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.720]   I just feel like you're--
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.840]   I know.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   The misty water-colored memories of the twit cottage
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.720]   that were--
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.960]   It was a weird thing.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.000]   The air conditioning, the complimentary beverages.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.680]   The 3D camera, I have a great shot of you playing
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.000]   with Diet Coke in 3D, which we'll have to post somewhere.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.040]   It should be the sponsorship opportunity.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.200]   Yes, exactly.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.160]   Also here is the illustrious, the wondrous.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.080]   Christopher Breen.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.760]   Hey, Chris.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   How's it going?
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.400]   Hang on, I've tried to order an iPhone.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.920]   It's only been four hours.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.320]   I swear, this time it's going to work.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.200]   So this is, of course, the story, the top story of today,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.400]   is that we have, of course, the iPhone
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.360]   is available for pre-order, theoretically.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.440]   Theoretically available for pre-order.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.160]   The iPhone 4, of course, is supposed to come out today.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.280]   And there's been a lot of changes.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.040]   And it's hard to tell exactly what has caused the issue,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   because there's been a lot of changes.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.440]   Apple has added a new application.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.280]   They've put this all the stuff up.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.240]   They've set up the web page.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.440]   And you can get through part of it, right?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.320]   But not quite all the way.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.680]   Is anyone getting an order through?
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.600]   Chris?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.160]   No, let's see, I started 7 o'clock AM Pacific time.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.960]   It's now three hours later.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.120]   I've been trying for two and 1/2 hours.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.600]   I've reached various levels of success.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.200]   There's the crashes immediately.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.560]   There's the getting through to checking your information
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.280]   on AT&T and then timing out.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.160]   And I stumbled upon something unique twice,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.120]   where I actually get through.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.800]   It goes through AT&T, and then it says, I'm sorry.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   We can't process your order, because your bill hasn't been paid.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.520]   And so they throw you out for that reason.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.640]   And then you go back to the beginning,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.840]   then at time, side a bunch of times.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.200]   Is that kind of a little bit like the check is in the mail?
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.520]   It is kind of like that.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.920]   It's sort of like you feel like, OK, I finally--
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   I got those front row seats to the Nirvana get together again.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.760]   They've brought Kurt back from heaven.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.080]   And they're going to be able to see him.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.040]   And then-- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.840]   We won't accept your credit card information.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.240]   And you have to start back at the end of the line again.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.960]   So I still haven't been successful.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.440]   I did help her finally order in store pickup,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.120]   thinking that will be my backup plan,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.600]   and got through using Apple's app.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.960]   And I got a message.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.080]   I got a confirmation saying, your phone will only be $600.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.640]   When AT&T told me it would be list price plus $18.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   When did you buy your 3GS?
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.000]   I bought it the first day.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.600]   Interesting.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   Because yeah, I got the-- you know,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   I did the same thing where I text messaged the magic number.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.000]   And it told me $18 as well.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.640]   Now, Andy, are you pre-ordering an iPhone, or have you tried?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.480]   No, because I feel as though ordering Apple stuff
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.800]   has become like trying to get cold plate tickets where.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   The whole process is just to underscore user or a chump.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.240]   There are people who are meant to get these.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.840]   There are people who are meant to buy it
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.480]   from the people who got them and pay a 400% markup.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.320]   I know that's not what's happening here.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.360]   But when a consumer item becomes so difficult to purchase
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.240]   that it becomes a little bit like a Candyland game,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.400]   where roll the dice 1, 2, 3.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   Oh, your web browser had a DNS failure.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360]   Go back five spaces and go to the back of the virtual queue
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.680]   again.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.880]   Oh, well.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.800]   You got to the head of the line.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.920]   Oh, but the white one is sold out.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.520]   Go back.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.800]   Go back eight spaces and resubmit again.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.960]   It seems-- I was surprised to see the Apple store running slow.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.000]   That was the thing that seemed--
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.440]   I mean, the AT&T thing-- you kind of expected it's AT&T.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.040]   But to have the Apple store actually just feeling like it
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.440]   was just barely making it through the process really surprised
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   me this morning.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.720]   And of course, I got about as far as-- to me, every single time
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.320]   I was patient, I would just click it,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   and then I'd go back to doing whatever I was doing.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.880]   I'd come back, and I'd be on another page.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.200]   And then I click on that, and I'd do it.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.320]   And I'd get to the point where AT&T--
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.120]   where I had to check AT&T to find out
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.320]   whether my phone number and my address,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.560]   and then that was the end of the road in all cases.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.240]   Now it turns out there's a report
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.440]   that people are actually lining up in Japan
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.000]   for the-- to get pre-orders.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.440]   I mean, yeah.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.600]   See, if this was the first working cell phone in history,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.760]   then yes, it would be worth lining up for like that.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.480]   Otherwise, I could wait--
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   my dignity is worth about three and a half weeks.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.880]   If I have to not get it first day
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.360]   and be able to have to wait a little bit,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.960]   that's perfectly fine by me as a consumer.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.320]   Now, what do you think is really driving the heavy demand?
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.440]   What part of the new iPhone are people really
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.840]   that excited about to buy?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.000]   I mean, is it the retinal display?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.160]   Do you think that that is the number one driving factor
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.000]   of this new iPhone?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.120]   Is it the front-facing camera?
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.600]   Chris?
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.320]   Well, I think that there are a lot of features in here
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.640]   that people find attractive.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.840]   But honestly, I think what may be driving a lot of the traffic
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.360]   today is the fact that Steve said AT&T is offering people
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.320]   generous terms to re-up when prior to this in the past,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.200]   when we had a-- we're going from the 3G to the 3GS.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.240]   The people who purchased the 3G had to pay that penalty.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.080]   That, OK, I'm going to flip the phone in one year.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   It's going to be a lot more expensive,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.680]   but I'm willing to do that.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.480]   Those people like me who checked AT&T and found out,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   no, it's actually going to be less price was $18.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.440]   Of course, I'm going to try to get it first day.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.520]   So I think that there are a lot of people like me
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.840]   who believe Steve with the generous terms.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.200]   And actually, I think the generous terms probably will
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.640]   happen.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.360]   I think my little message about it being $600
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.320]   is something that Apple and I will have a long discussion about.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.560]   And I expect that this has been a mistake,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.000]   because I've heard from a couple of other people
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.160]   who got that same message and said, no, no, no, AT&T,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.240]   confirmed that this would be it.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.720]   So I think the price is part of it.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.280]   But certainly, the front-facing phone
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.400]   looks very attractive, the faster processor, the screen.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.720]   People I know who've actually laid hands on the thing
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.000]   say the screen is fabulous.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.920]   So--
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.000]   So I think it's any one thing.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.200]   It's not any one thing.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.000]   It's a mixture.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.320]   Now, here's the-- here's one question that I have
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.960]   that I haven't been able to quite get to the bottom of,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.320]   which is when we go for $18 rather than the more expensive,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.520]   are we giving up our unlimited subscription for bandwidth?
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.720]   Unlimited data?
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.560]   No, AT&T did say that if you have an existing data plan
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.120]   before the new plan goes into effect,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.760]   you'll be grandfathered in.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.000]   That even extends to iPad 3G owners
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.480]   who thought they were going to be buying just one month
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.120]   worth of 3G service and then canceling it just to test it out.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.080]   But now our feeling is, though, yeah,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.160]   I really would like to have unlimited data
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.080]   for the life of the product.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.120]   So maybe I will keep that.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.280]   So it is the life of the product.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.320]   So if you buy-- if you do the $18 thing
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   and write a new subscription plan,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.760]   you're still going to be on the unlimited
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.720]   if you started there.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.000]   Because that's the whole thing.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.720]   I'm sorry, with the 4G.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.520]   I believe from what I read of AT&T's press release
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.960]   and the questions that I ask of AT&T afterward,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   the impression I got was that the data plan is attached
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.920]   to the account and not to the device.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.600]   So as long as you keep paying $x per month
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.160]   for the data plan that you had before the switchover,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.720]   if you upgrade your service to a new phone,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   again, you're basically transferring that existing SIM
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.560]   into the 4G, then I believe that it should go--
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.800]   it should continue through.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.640]   If you were to buy a 4G as a second line,
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.360]   then I don't believe that you would still
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.200]   have unlimited data.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.040]   But it would still be attached to that original SIM
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.280]   and that original account.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.440]   OK, because my conspiracy theory mind was looking at that going,
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.840]   well, they give us $18 upgrade because we're
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.880]   going to rewrite our subscription.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.160]   I mean, giving you that means that you're starting a new two-year
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.800]   plan, not continuing the plan that we bought last year.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.320]   And as a result, it won't be unlimited when we move forward.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.760]   And I hadn't been able to find it,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.120]   but it doesn't look like that's the case.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.640]   So it looks like you're going to be able to continue--
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.280]   the theory is, you're going to be able to continue unlimited,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.040]   at least in the midterm.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   I think that's true.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.720]   I've read reports of that as well,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.400]   but maybe that I'm reading Andy's reports.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.520]   And that's-- maybe he's the source for all this information.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.040]   But I believe I've read this in a couple of different places
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.280]   that it is grandfather Dan.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.680]   There are times when you don't even
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.720]   know if the person that you're talking to at AT&T or at the company
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.560]   truly understands the terms of the deal
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.960]   that their company is offering.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.360]   So as a consumer, before I click any button to switch to,
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.400]   I'm going to upgrade to the 4G, believe me.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.080]   That's the one time in three years
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   I'll be reading every single sentence of one of those
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.640]   just click through.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.280]   I agree to these terms, agreements.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.320]   And I have to admit that for me, as I look at it,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.720]   I mean, at first I was like, oh, I can't believe I'm going--
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.280]   you know, the unlimited is going to go away.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.360]   And if I get anything new, it's not going to be unlimited.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.240]   But I have to admit that most of my day--
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.480]   I look at really most of my day, it's Wi-Fi enabled.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.120]   Most of my day is something that I already--
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.440]   I mean, I don't run over my limit on my Wi-Fi.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.560]   As a matter of fact, I was using my Wi-Fi as a baseline
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.360]   for my usage.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.760]   To me, the 5GIG cap on the Wi-Fi is pretty much perfect,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.400]   because there are many months out of the year
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.120]   when I use more than four gigs.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.320]   There are very few in which I actually break it.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.760]   To me, the 2GIG cap is a big problem,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.720]   because that means that there are going to be at least three
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.320]   or four months out of the year when I will be paying extra.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.000]   It'll probably even be more than the extra five bucks a month.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.520]   And I have to do a whole bunch of math now to figure out
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.200]   whether or not saving five bucks a month times 12 months
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.040]   will make up for all the overages I'm
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.080]   going to incur with a 2GIG cap.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.360]   Unfortunately, there is that if you go into settings,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.280]   you will be able to click on a tab and find out exactly how
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.240]   much data you're using per month in your iPhone,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.320]   so you can get a good handle on whether the changes are
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.360]   going to affect you or not.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.760]   I agree that for a lot of people, it's just not going to be
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.640]   something that they're even going to notice.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.560]   I do admit that if AT&T gave me an option to do exactly what
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.160]   I do with my MyFi with my iPad, if I was able to have five people
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.360]   connect to it, not just tethering my computer, but all of them.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.680]   For 60 bucks a month, I would just get rid of my MyFi.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.240]   Right.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.440]   And it would be so much more convenient, one less device
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:31.960]   to have.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.680]   Also, it would give us parity with all these really great Android
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.560]   devices that have been coming out over the past two or three
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.080]   months.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.440]   The new version of the operating system
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.160]   will have that built in as a built in feature
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.240]   of the operating system.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.840]   It'll still be something that the carrier will have to--
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.040]   will probably charge extra for, but at least it's not
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.720]   some special freak system that you have to be on sprint
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.120]   in order to get this feature.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.480]   So I think Apple really needs to pull up
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.360]   its socks in terms of how well this device shares its internet
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.680]   with other devices.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.120]   Now, also today, Apple released--
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.920]   as we talked about alluded to-- the Apple Store app.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.240]   So this is a new application, so you
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.640]   can buy your iPhone on your iPhone.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.280]   Chris, did you take a look at it?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.440]   What do you think?
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.000]   I did.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.920]   I like it.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.600]   What you can do on this thing is that I was able to pre-order
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   for pickup.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.080]   And it was very simple.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.200]   And it actually worked.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.960]   There was no spinning anything.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.880]   You just tap it.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.000]   You entered your information.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.880]   And it said, great.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.080]   Here's the store.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.680]   Come and get it.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.280]   It will be here starting at 7 a.m.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.920]   And it will be here till close the day.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.840]   After that, you likely give the thing up.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.360]   And you get a receipt for it within minutes.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.960]   So I think it's a very nice application.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.560]   I wish the results had been better than what they turned out
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:43.920]   to be.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.040]   But it's good.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.800]   I wish there was an iPad version.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.880]   I think so far it's just the iPhone version.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.280]   I downloaded it to my iPad, so it looks a little funny when
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.600]   it's blown up.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.120]   2x.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.200]   But it works.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   It does seem a little odd that you wouldn't have an eye.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.600]   Because it seems like the iPad would be the perfect device.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.280]   Or maybe that's the next one coming.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.960]   When I started playing with it this morning,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   because I thought, oh, well, maybe it
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.640]   will work better than the website as far as ordering.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.080]   So I tried it this morning.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.320]   And I thought that I was like, I would never order from a website
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.400]   again if I had an interface like this to put this stuff together.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.960]   Andy, have you given it a shot?
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.560]   Just briefly, I downloaded it about an hour, hour and a half ago.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.280]   This will sound weird.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.760]   But I was a little bit surprised they didn't decide to do it
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.480]   as an HTML5 app.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.880]   Given that this is something that they're given the different kinds
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.720]   of data that Apple pushes out to people
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.120]   or would like to push out to people,
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.240]   it seems as though you'd want to have something that was really
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.120]   dynamic that keeps adding features
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.640]   without having to upgrade the actual app itself.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.800]   Also, it's a way to sort of emphatically state, hey, look,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.200]   here's you're never going to believe this.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.640]   But we were eating our own dog food.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.800]   Our own iPhone's Apple Store app is written entirely at HTML5.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.680]   So nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.840]   So I'm not sure how often I'm going to use it, though.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.400]   I don't think that it'll do anything for me personally
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.560]   that I couldn't get just by simply hitting the hitting
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.480]   apple.com and having them having a really good mobile version
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.440]   of that site.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.640]   I do sometimes reserve reservations at the genius bar.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.560]   But I'm not sure if I want to be told that, oh, by the way,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.680]   Final Cut Pro 10.4.1.8 is now 10.4.1.9.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.760]   Tap this for more information.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.560]   Right.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.440]   We'll be right back with the show in just a minute.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.840]   But before we do, I really got to tell you about--
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.760]   Sorry.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.360]   I--
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.860]   No, wait.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.640]   I want to hear what you're going to tell us about.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.320]   We'll play it then.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.240]   If you want to see what he was going to talk about,
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.000]   Leo was--
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.640]   British Petroleum's pockets.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.760]   He silenced Leo before he could tell the truth.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.280]   Yes.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.400]   I was like-- he was saying something scandalous.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.240]   No, actually.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.080]   It wasn't scandalous at all.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.760]   In fact, we'll go ahead and play it for you.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.920]   This is-- instead, Leo, as you know,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.680]   is down in the south covering E3.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   But we didn't want to leave the whole show without him.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.480]   And he has a couple of things to say about the Ford Sync.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.440]   So let me play this again here.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.760]   So let's-- let me make sure that I've got everything working
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   here.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.920]   And we'll be right back with the show in just a minute.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.600]   But before we do, I really got to tell you about Ford
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.680]   and the Ford Amazing Ford Sync.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.800]   I've been a Ford Sync owner now since last year.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.520]   And I can't tell you how much I love it.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.000]   In fact, anytime I try the GPS, the turn-by-turn directions,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.720]   the hands-free calling, and any other make, I go, what?
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.800]   How could I have used this?
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.200]   We haven't-- I won't say the name.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.880]   But Artoyota Highlander, the other car in the family,
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.000]   just doesn't cut it compared to this.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.440]   I want you to go to SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.960]   You can find out more about the amazing Ford Sync Sync MyRide
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.320]   podcast.com.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.560]   Details are there.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.400]   Video, you can watch Sync in action.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.280]   Let me give you an idea of some of the features.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.920]   We're all making mobile phone calls these days in our car.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   And you know how dangerous that is.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.240]   Ford Sync keeps your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.960]   while you're making these calls.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.080]   You press the button on the steering wheel.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.640]   The Sync says, what do you want to do?
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.520]   You say phone.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.360]   Then it says, OK, who do you want to call?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.080]   You say, by name, who you want to call,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.560]   or you can dial a number by number.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.640]   Never look off the road.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.520]   Never keep your hands off the wheel.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.640]   And yet you can do everything that you'd want to do.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.200]   For instance, I use it with Dial to Do, which is a great service.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.760]   And I'm able to add stuff to the calendar,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.440]   send an email message, and everything, all using the Ford Sync.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.960]   It's just incredible.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.520]   It's true, hands-free calling.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.280]   You also get turn-by-turn directions.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.880]   You get 911 assist.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.280]   So if something bad should happen, it will call 911 for you.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.320]   Send the GPS coordinates to them.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.280]   Sync is available exclusively on Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:00.640]   dealers.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.480]   It works with most Bluetooth-enabled phones.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.440]   In fact, I have a number of phones
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.800]   all connected to my Sync.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.440]   Even my iPad connected to the Sync, not for phone calls,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.640]   but to listen to the audio.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:16.920]   You get personalized traffic alerts, music and podcast search
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.600]   on my iPad, on my iPhone, and most MP3 players on my iPod.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.760]   If there are traffic alerts, and if there's a problem with traffic,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.920]   it will reroute you with turn-by-turn directions
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.200]   on some phones, audible text messages as well.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.160]   They'll read you the text messages.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.640]   Go to SyncMyRidePodcast.com and learn more.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.760]   And the next time you're in the market for a car,
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:45.000]   this is, believe it or not, a reason to consider a Ford.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.280]   There are lots of other great reasons.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.400]   I love my Mustang, but Ford Sync makes it all the better.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.960]   SyncMyRidePodcast.com or visit your Ford dealer
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.560]   and get them to demonstrate the fantastic Ford Sync.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.720]   SyncMyRidePodcast.com.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.000]   Thanks for letting me interrupt.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.760]   Guys, now back to the show.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.520]   So there we go.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.160]   That's what I ran into there.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.360]   And I have to admit that I like Leo's Mustang too.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   I wrote in it all the way from San Francisco to Petaluma,
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.280]   then from Petaluma to the airport last week.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.000]   And what you don't know about the Twit Mustang
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.120]   is that it is just like being in a car that's sponsored
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.600]   by Coca-Cola.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.440]   The radio plays nothing but Twit Podcast,
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.240]   like all to the ride up and down.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.680]   It's not like Cuichesa Station, but no, no, no, no.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.840]   Let's listen to this week in incandescent lighting.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.320]   Almost time in this week in recycling.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   It's such a-- the Mustang is such this--
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.280]   it's this odd mixture of muscle car and geek tool,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.240]   all at the same time.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.960]   So it's like the perfect mix.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.200]   It is indeed one sweet ride.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.000]   Speaking of a--
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.520]   By longs of the day when I can ride in that car.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.360]   Oh, you haven't been in the Mustang?
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.960]   No, I haven't been up to the cottage.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.440]   I'm hoping to come up in September
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.600]   and get a little ride around the block.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.000]   Very, very, very carefully.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.320]   Because Dan was driving.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.960]   It was like he had dad's car.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.800]   It was like when-- like floundering like--
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.440]   This is my brother's car.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.560]   There's a scratch on it.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.640]   He's going to kill me.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.120]   He only-- he only wipes it with a diaper.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.040]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.240]   So speaking of new rides, Apple has also quietly.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   It's funny, you know, this continues this conspiracy
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.280]   theory that Apple's not paying much attention
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.600]   to the hardware end of things.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.480]   When they just kind of quietly-- no real announcements.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.480]   It just kind of shows up in the lower corner.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.120]   But there is a new Mac Mini.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.240]   Chris, have you taken a look at this?
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.440]   I have-- this is actually--
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.560]   I think to demonstrate that they have kind of gotten a little
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.720]   sloppy about some of the details.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.520]   This is actually should be the Apple TV2.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.680]   Yeah, rather than the Mac Mini.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.520]   Because that's what this is really designed for.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.840]   Apple finally realized that people are using Mac Mini's.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.760]   And they get these things.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.880]   And if they're not using it for servers and that kind of thing,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.640]   they attach them to their television set.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.960]   And they make some sort of odd and ugly connection
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   to the TV.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.920]   Now they don't have to, because this new Mac Mini is really
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.560]   about media.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.960]   It's got an HDMI port on it.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.920]   It's got the disc player on it, which people have been wanting
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.240]   in an Apple TV.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.640]   It also has DisplayPort.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.760]   So if you don't want to do the straight HDMI connection,
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.480]   you can maybe do DisplayPort to HDMI.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.840]   The hope is that audio goes to that DisplayPort connection
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.720]   as well, and that you can get an adapter that supports
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.520]   that sort of thing.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.680]   Well, and also isn't it--
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.040]   HDMI now will allow all the copy written material.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.640]   So if you were going to do a streaming service,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.600]   an HDMI connection would be required, wouldn't it?
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.280]   You know, I've gone through here on the latest MacBook Pro,
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.560]   and I've been able to get copy written material
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.320]   to go out through DisplayPort into an adapter that then goes
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.160]   to HDMI.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.000]   It all goes out through a single cable.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.440]   OK.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:03.840]   OK.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.160]   And Andy, have you taken a look at it?
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.680]   And I found out about it the way that most people did
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.360]   by incorrectly by creating a new window in Safari,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.800]   and it brought me to Apple's site by default.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.560]   And oh, I guess there is something new this morning.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.600]   I didn't get a press release.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.800]   There was no phone call, no nothing.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.920]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.320]   It doesn't look like a Mac Mini.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.040]   It looks like an Apple TV Plus, or it
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.960]   looks like the hybrid between the two.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.040]   It's got a lot of features.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.480]   It really looks great.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.760]   But man, the price.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.440]   They essentially gave it all the oomph of a $9--
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.600]   $1,000 MacBook, same graphics processor,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.320]   same internal processor, mostly the same capabilities.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.440]   But the idea of now spending $699 on a Mac Mini,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.480]   I'm wondering if Apple hasn't lost the thread.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.000]   I always thought that the greatest feature of the Mac
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.440]   Mini has always been the price, the idea
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.120]   that you can lay down less than walk in with $500 or less
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.440]   and walk out with a Mac.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.280]   My guess is that they're looking at who's buying them.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.560]   And Apple, of course, has more data than we do.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.120]   But I know that for me, I bought an Apple TV,
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.600]   and then I bought a cheaper Mac Mini
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.280]   and then at the company.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.960]   And then I bought for myself another Mac Mini.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.320]   But I just got the most expensive-- the one that is as
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.360]   tuned up as I could get it.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.320]   And I'm guessing that a lot of people
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.240]   might have done the same thing.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.160]   Where Apple may be seeing the data where just a lot of people
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.520]   are buying the $699 version of the Mac Mini.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.280]   I kind of feel like if I'm going to buy one,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.960]   I think a lot of-- for me, I always
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.640]   look at-- I have to commit to this thing
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.240]   for a certain period of time.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.400]   And $100 difference doesn't mean a lot to me,
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.840]   because I'm going to put a bunch of stuff on it.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.080]   I'm going to be doing all the stuff with it.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.480]   And I don't want to have to want to upgrade later.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.560]   I think part of it is also my own prejudices.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.200]   Growing up, I always thought that a desktop, a Mac,
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.000]   or desktop computer is a box about yay big.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.800]   You can open up the lid and get access to the innards with.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.720]   And a hot plate size device is built out of CNC,
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.920]   out of one block of aluminum, just like aircraft,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.040]   the spacecraft components.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   And that's an actual quote from Apple's tech specs on it.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.280]   I don't associate that in my mind with a $699 computer.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.800]   Even though if I look at the specs,
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.960]   they really didn't chimp out on anything here.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.240]   There's a huge number of USB ports.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   There's a full firewire port.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.840]   And not only is there that HDMI port,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.280]   but they are two separate outputs.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.640]   So you can have two screens plugged into this at the same time.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.280]   So in all fairness, although I do really
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.600]   think that Apple needs to have a cheaper Mac out there
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.240]   in the product line somewhere, if you essentially
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.400]   took the same thing, stuck it inside a Mac LC3 box
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.040]   and kept the price at $699, I'd probably say, yes,
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.520]   that's a handsome product.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   Well worth the $699.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.520]   Right.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.200]   It's a very compact little--
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.600]   It also has an SD card.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.440]   I don't know if we mentioned that, an SD card slot.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.720]   In the back, though, what an odd place to put it.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.520]   I'm really going to reach the ground behind it
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   to get into your camera card.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.840]   Why don't I put it on one of the sides?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.560]   Well, but it doesn't look as nice.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.360]   I think that--
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.800]   I feel like the DVD--
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.960]   someone was mentioning today.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.400]   I tweeted it and someone was talking about,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.360]   does it have Blu-ray?
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.840]   And I was surprised that it had a DVD.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.000]   I was surprised it had any kind of way to input plastic.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.320]   Apple seems to be so anti-plastic.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.040]   Well, now they also have a server version that has no slot
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.400]   at all.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:27.900]   Right.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.240]   Well, and that's interesting.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.440]   And I think that Apple has looked at--
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.080]   I felt like they were listening to me.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.240]   It's like a Microsoft commercial.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.520]   I thought they were listening to me,
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.880]   because the two ways that I use our Mac minis
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.280]   is, one, is I have them for media servers.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.800]   And two, we have a lot of them that we use for servers
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.560]   within the office, like little key servers that
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.760]   don't require a lot of hardware.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.160]   They don't require a lot of stuff.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.280]   They're not going to be handling lots and lots
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.440]   of web traffic or anything else.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.320]   They just need to kind of give us access to a--
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.760]   as I said, a VPN or give us access to drives or whatever.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.560]   They're the perfect little device for it.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.160]   Absolutely.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.520]   I can't tell you many times I've walked into a server room
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.360]   or a server closet.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.640]   And you see these big screaming blade servers made by Dell.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.920]   But somewhere in the middle of it,
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.760]   there is going to be a Mac mini that
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.400]   isn't serving all these files to 1,000 different employees.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.340]   But it's the one that serves all the tools
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.040]   that the administrators use to administrate all that network.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.200]   So it's a staple of networking.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   Now, Chris, do you think that the HDMI is a precursor
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.800]   to something like a streaming service?
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.200]   I hope so.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.160]   I think the fact that they bought Lala indicates
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.440]   that they're interested in this.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.920]   I don't buy the idea that they needed engineers,
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.440]   because it's not like there aren't lots of them out of work.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.720]   So yes, I do think that they're probably
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.480]   looking at a streaming service video as well as audio.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.400]   I'm not sure how they're going to implement it.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:45.480]   Nobody is.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.520]   But it may temporarily be, at least for audio,
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.920]   to be the stuff that you already own.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   And you get it through a mobile me sort of service
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.600]   where we understand what you have.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.320]   We're going to make all this stuff available to you
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.600]   through the cloud.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.640]   But yes, for video, it would be so sweet to sort of say,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.280]   oh, Apple TV, yes, that was a prototype for this.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.640]   And this is what we really want to do.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.880]   What it means is they're going to have to tweak front row
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.920]   or create something else that's a good media application.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.240]   I like the Mac many a lot as a media server,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.440]   but I do because I know how to operate a Mac
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.600]   and I can do all those multimedia things with it.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.640]   My family doesn't.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.160]   And front row isn't yet capable enough
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.960]   that it provides me with all the capabilities I need,
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.880]   although it's easy enough for my family to use.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.040]   I mean, for me, I just want to be able to just use my iPhone
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.480]   or even my iPad to just run the Mac many.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.120]   So I'm sitting there in front of my TV
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:41.160]   because I have to admit that about 60%, 70% of the time
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   that I'm sitting in front of a TV,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.520]   I'm also sitting in front of my iPad.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.160]   Because I'm usually fiddling around with it, stuff.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.160]   And if I could just switch over to control the Mac many
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   and change the channels and do all the things
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.920]   that I want to do on my iPad, it seems
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.280]   like it would be the perfect little connection.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.880]   Yeah, it's an interesting problem because, yes,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.480]   you can have Wi-Fi control and there are lots of apps
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.160]   that can do this and I've done it on my iPhone
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.960]   and it works really well.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.280]   But you've also got IR issues because most of your components
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.480]   aren't Wi-Fi capable.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.720]   So you have to have IR solution and there are these little
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.440]   dongles that will plug into your iPad or your iPhone.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.360]   But I've tested five or six of them and none of them
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.760]   are terribly good.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.480]   You're much better off of the Logitech remote
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.080]   doing that.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.640]   So now you've got the two devices.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.080]   So we're still looking for that single app IR solution
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.240]   that we can do from an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.360]   Andy, do you see that interconnection between the iPhone
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.560]   and the iPad imminent for what we're seeing with the Mac
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.680]   many?
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.360]   One should definitely hope so.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.160]   If you look at the developer capabilities inside the iPhone
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.720]   and the iPad, you see that a very close level of interaction
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.000]   between those two devices is definitely possible.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.760]   Also, the idea that this could be not just an Apple TV,
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.480]   an Apple TV, but also you think about now,
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.200]   it used to be a big deal for somebody
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.040]   to have a high resolution computer grade monitor in your house.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.320]   And if you had it, it was attached to that box
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.440]   that was in your office.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.120]   Now, every house has two or three devices of HD TVs
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.720]   that are capable of supporting this sort of video.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.880]   This thing will pump out.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.120]   So maybe it's more of a budget thing than we assume.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.240]   If we're just assuming that it is designed to be plugged
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.880]   into an HD TV, maybe they are thinking
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.040]   not just the idea of plugging into the living room,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.440]   but Junior has an HD TV in his bedroom.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.480]   And now that will be the screen for his brand new Mac
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.640]   instead of spending $1,500 on an iMac.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.440]   We'll have the affordable $699 and $1 one,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.920]   it's bring your own monitor time.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.240]   And I do admit that with my Mac mini,
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.200]   I love being able to just sit there with a wireless,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.560]   and I can sit on the couch with a wireless keyboard
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.040]   and sit there and do a little surfing
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.600]   and then jump back to, for me,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.760]   it's still switching back to Comcast
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.200]   or whatever to watch TV if I want to.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.600]   But it'd be great to just get that completely disconnected.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.960]   - I'd be more pleased if there were a way
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.280]   to get my iPad working in that kind of a way with my HD TV.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.800]   It still steams me that it doesn't matter how much money
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.720]   you've spent on video content, five-g iTunes store,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.800]   all they're gonna give you is a VGA dongle
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.040]   that will not output to that
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.720]   because they think that you're gonna pirate movies
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.080]   via that cable.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.760]   - Well, and if you're really gonna pirate the movies
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.000]   via that cable, I mean, the thing is,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.720]   is with an HDMI connected to an intensity card.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.840]   So you get a little, you know, a $150,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.680]   you know, black magic intensity card
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.600]   and you take the HDMI out of your Blu-ray player,
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.920]   just a standard Blu-ray player and plug it in there
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.120]   and then just hit record.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.960]   (laughs)
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   If someone wants to back up their Blu-ray collection,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.720]   it's not any harder than that.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.000]   - Yeah, but don't try this at home.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.840]   - Yeah.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.680]   - What?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.760]   - We would never suggest that you should actually do it.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.720]   We're simply talking about the technology
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.960]   that is available to people with lower moral standards
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.120]   than we would ever have.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.400]   That's all right.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   - But Doshi hate this.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.080]   It's the standard approach of saying we are powerless
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.040]   to stop video piracy where it is actually happening,
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.560]   which is actually inside the,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.360]   in the duplicating facilities where they're secured
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.240]   but they're not that secure.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.080]   They're gonna wind up in bit,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.160]   really good copies wind up on bit torrent,
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.200]   like within days of it being sent out for remastering.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.920]   But let's just hit it, let's just attack this problem
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.280]   in a way that makes sure that people who have no intention
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.160]   and no desire to pirate movies will not be able to access
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.560]   a simple, natural feature of this product
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.240]   they've just paid a lot of money for.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.320]   Just stinks.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.040]   - I think we just need to have,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.520]   people need to start wearing T-shirts to say,
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.080]   "Computers don't pirate software, I do."
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.960]   (laughs)
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.880]   - So that's a, this argument looks very much
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.720]   like a gun control argument,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   where it's only the evil doers have the stuff.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.560]   And it just, it seems like like everything else.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.320]   It's just something that it's very difficult to stop.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.800]   So anyway, now speaking of something hard to stop,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.360]   there's also something hard to start.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   This is in, you have Microsoft actually paying
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.280]   high app developers to port to Windows 7.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.200]   This is according to the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.360]   Andy, can you give us a little information on this?
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.000]   - Just a little bit, realize that the app,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.280]   Microsoft has actually had this gaming platform,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.960]   so to speak, up and running for nearly a year now,
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.840]   because the very first Zoom HD that came out
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.800]   for Christmas time last year is the exact same development
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.400]   platform and the exact same gaming platform,
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.320]   as we're gonna find on Windows system series,
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.400]   seven mobile, seven mobile phone platform.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.240]   I don't know what they're calling it now,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.920]   but let's just make fun of it no matter what.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.280]   And they thought that there would be a certain,
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.880]   a lot of game development for this device.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.440]   Nothing has really materialized.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.160]   They're also realizing that they're starting
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.040]   just absolutely from, from step zero,
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.600]   with releasing this new platform.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.840]   So they're giving actual cash incentives to developers
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.640]   to try to port their hit iPhone games
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.120]   over to Windows seven to make sure that
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.440]   they'll have something in the stores
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.040]   when it actually opens.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.600]   And I haven't, this is early stuff.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.120]   I haven't really talked to anybody who's accepted
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.240]   that offer yet.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.040]   I've talked to a couple of developers who seem to think
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.000]   that they don't want to be that first paying
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.760]   when to jump off the ice flow.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.280]   That they're not, that the terms are that they think
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.760]   that Microsoft are being offered is not enough to offset
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.560]   the monumental cost of totally rewriting this game
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.280]   in a totally alien development environment.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.040]   They'd have to go from C flavors,
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.320]   which is what they develop software for the iPhone
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.000]   to Silverlight and other bizarre little hicomodoodles
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.400]   to get it working on a Windows phone.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.520]   They feel as though they would really have to have enough
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.880]   money upfront to pay their staff's salary
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.160]   for the amount of time it would take
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.560]   to move those games over.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.280]   And they just don't see that happening.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.480]   - Chris, is Microsoft in a bind here where,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.440]   I'm sure they have a majority of the PC market,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.400]   but when it comes to online,
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.000]   whether it's Google Docs or mobile devices,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   it seems like they just can't seem to get a foothold
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.760]   in any of these markets.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.080]   - Yeah, they're really struggling and it seems odd
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.760]   that Microsoft should be considering the behemoth
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.280]   they once were, but they really have been so slow
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.880]   about so many things recently,
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.040]   getting an operating system out that's worth a damn,
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.400]   getting into the mobile space that find the Xbox
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.920]   has broken through and it's a viable platform.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   But in this mobile gaming space, they're up against it.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.880]   I mean, the App Store is done so well.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.400]   People, particularly the high profile developers
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.640]   are making a lot of money there.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.720]   Andy's absolutely right.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.800]   It's very costly to do this kind of porting.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.960]   I would also think that if you're a major app developer,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.320]   you have to think twice before putting your stuff
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.960]   on the App Store and then turning and say,
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.560]   "Oh, by the way, you wouldn't mind so much
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.000]   if we did this for Microsoft too, would you?"
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.080]   Because Apple has demonstrated lately
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.320]   that they kind of like to keep their stuff in their store
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.480]   and they don't care so much for people venturing out.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.720]   So I have to, first of all,
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.520]   I think the big name developers don't need it
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.080]   because they're doing quite well with the App Store.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.360]   And the smaller ones, I think, would be concerned
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.680]   that if they were to go and work for Microsoft,
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.880]   that maybe they wouldn't have such great exposure
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.160]   at the App Store or maybe no exposure at all.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.080]   - Between the App Store and Android
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.120]   is the oxygen just kind of leaving this mobile market?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.040]   I mean, it just seems like between those are the two markets
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   that are working and nothing else is really,
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.400]   it might get to the point where it's very hard
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.320]   to launch anywhere else.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.720]   - Yeah, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.600]   I think the smartest strategy for Microsoft would be
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.200]   to not say, "We've got the store with 20,000 apps
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.400]   "and we are the computing platform of the future.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.840]   "This is like having an iPad in your pocket."
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.640]   They can simply say, "There is a great number of people
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.760]   "that have very, very limited needs
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.800]   "that go outside basic phone functions
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.320]   "where they want a working email client,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.920]   "they want a working web browser,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.400]   "and they want access to social media."
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.200]   And if they have a few extra apps outside of that,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.080]   that's really good.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.280]   But we're gonna make sure that the central experience
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.600]   of using this as a device for communications
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.760]   and media is the most polished and beautiful experience
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.280]   you can get in a handheld device.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.320]   And right now, if they went with that direction,
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.160]   they would be so far along in that gambit
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   because the iPhone is still my favorite
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.840]   phone operating system on the planet.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.800]   But if I could get their Microsoft Windows, excuse me,
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.360]   the Zoom HD media player on the iPhone,
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.320]   I would probably be using that
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   instead of iPhones basic built-in media player.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.560]   It's beautiful, it's simple, it's functional.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.920]   It lets you do things like just simply say,
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.400]   take disparate pieces of media,
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.160]   like playlist, albums, photos,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.720]   and just sort of pin them off to the sides
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.000]   that they're always one tap away from where you want.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.960]   You don't have to really start burrowing
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.360]   into the menu structure to get access to the stuff
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.160]   that you use all the time.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.600]   It's a very, very lovely thing.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.880]   And I really wanna see what they do with this a year from now.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.960]   If they stop trying to play Apple's game
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.720]   and they stop trying to play Google's game
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.440]   and they simply try to find people
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.200]   who aren't being satisfied by either one of those groups,
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.080]   they could really have something there, but it's Microsoft.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.120]   They're low on commitment.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:25.120]   And I really, if there's a row of like no Vena Camels behind me,
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.360]   there's about four of them lit for Microsoft right now,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.520]   they're mobile strategy.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.440]   - Well, is there an issue about time here?
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.360]   I mean, the thing is, is that the longer this goes,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.280]   the further Apple gets ahead, the further Android gets ahead,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.080]   it seems like that battle continues to be more and more
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.040]   of an uphill slog to get forward.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.600]   Chris?
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.440]   - Well, I think it is.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.360]   And I think also people tend to think in twos, right?
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.320]   There can be two things.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.320]   There can be Microsoft and there can be Apple,
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.080]   or there can be the iPhone and there can be Android,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.280]   but once you're sort of that number three option,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.960]   people go, "Oh, and yeah, and there's a burger king too,
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.320]   but it's not in and out and it's not McDonald's."
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.680]   So yeah, I guess if the other two are closed,
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.840]   maybe I'll try that out.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   I just, I keep looking at Microsoft
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.560]   and I think with all the money
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.600]   and all the engineering talent you've got,
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.560]   what are you doing?
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.200]   You just seem like you've stepped in quicks in
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.440]   and you're sinking and sinking in.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.440]   I don't know, maybe it means Balmer goes
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.000]   and somebody with fresh ideas comes in there.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.320]   - Now this is on the heels of course of an announcement
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   that Apple has now passed 10,000 native apps for the iPad.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.400]   So this isn't the 150,000 or 200,000
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.440]   or whatever the number is now for the iPhone,
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.360]   but actually 10,000 apps that are available specifically
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.800]   for the iPad is, once again, this seems like another instance
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.560]   where it's a self-fulfilling thing.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   Once it gets ahead, once you start having
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.160]   all of those applications, it's hard to go back, Andy.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.600]   - Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.640]   Apple had a big head start on every other Android,
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.600]   Tegra 2 based tablet and they're still gonna be coming out
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.280]   later in the year, but it seems as though
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.720]   those are being delayed further and further as
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.640]   those manufacturers want to take a look at what iPad,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.120]   with the iPad marketplace is like
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.600]   and make sure that they're building exactly
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.000]   the right product to compete with it.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.160]   But yeah, that's a huge head start.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.120]   It's not just the number of applications,
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.960]   but it's also the hearts and minds war of attracting
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.040]   developers that it's taken them two or three months
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.160]   to start to learn how to develop for the iPad.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.760]   They had the tools well before the launch,
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.240]   but they didn't have the iPads in their hands,
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.520]   which made it pretty much impossible
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.760]   from the right software.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.040]   I've been saying all along that the iPad 2
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.800]   is not gonna be the next piece of hardware.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.360]   It's going to be August or September
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.640]   when everybody who needed three or four months
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   to develop a really killer iPad app
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.360]   has had those two or three months
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.840]   with an iPad in their hands.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   I just heard from, I probably shouldn't give the name,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.360]   but if you were to name three of the coolest
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.640]   productivity apps for the desktop Mac,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.880]   you would probably mention the name of this product,
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.480]   it's something I use each and every day.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.280]   And now they're really, really close to saying,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.120]   when we're just trying to figure out,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.340]   do people want to carry their entire office with them?
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.000]   In this app or do they want a lighter version
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.600]   that they can simply carry around with?
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.120]   Those are the things we're gonna start to see
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.560]   in August or September.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.560]   So when these Tegra 2-based Android tablets come out
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.000]   and they undercut the price by $100, $150, $200,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.360]   everyone's gonna be looking around saying,
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.960]   well, where's the software for it?
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.720]   Where if I'm giving you $400 for this tablet,
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.560]   how can I carry around my documents with it?
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.600]   How can I actually get some work done with it?
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.560]   And with the application that's the central figure
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.160]   of my desktop experience,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.020]   how do I get that data into this device?
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.340]   With the iPad, they'll say, well,
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.860]   you have four choices over there.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.100]   With Android, they'll say,
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.940]   there's an open source word processor
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.300]   that there's a project that in Google code
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.340]   that they think it's really gonna be available
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.580]   or you can just buy the Android version and it'll scale up.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.700]   - Well, do we think that there's an issue with,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.940]   you're looking at not only a lot of the apps,
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.380]   I mean, probably by the end of the summer,
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.100]   we're probably gonna see 30, 40, 50,000 apps
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.520]   that are available for the iPad
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.660]   as this thing really starts to ramp up.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.100]   Do we think that a lot of these Android,
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.600]   or all these are the tablets?
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.300]   I mean, they really have to exist at $350 or less
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.800]   or be able to go head to head with every feature
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.760]   that the iPad has.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.260]   Do you think that a lot of these delays
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.300]   are trying to find a margin at $350, Chris?
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.220]   - Well, yeah, I think it's a Herculean task
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.380]   for them to try to compete.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.380]   Yes, they can come in for less money
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.540]   and hope they can find a way to produce
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.860]   a tablet that's worth a darn doing that.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.540]   But I mean, people are gonna compare immediately.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   And as Andy says, when the apps aren't there
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.620]   and the answer is, oh, well, there's Google Docs,
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.500]   just do everything in a cloud because that's what this is
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.860]   about, most people are gonna say, well, nonsense.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.580]   No, I see what the iPad costs, I can do this
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.860]   and I've got by this time, 30,000 apps to choose from.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.740]   Why should I do this?
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.540]   And honestly, I just don't think price alone is gonna do it.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.880]   If they come out with the $350 tablet,
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.920]   and if that's the main selling feature,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.440]   I think people are gonna pungal up the extra 150 bucks
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.520]   and get an iPad instead.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.400]   - Well, the other thing is that there are people
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.080]   that I've talked to,
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.640]   unconnected directly to Apple.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.080]   I've said that as they look at all the pieces,
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.560]   they look at all the sections,
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.240]   Apple could probably sell an iPad for the lowest version
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   of the iPad for $400 and still make a margin.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.320]   And so the thing is, is that in the fall,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.600]   it seems like if Apple really wanted to suck the rest
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.480]   of the oxygen out of the system,
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.880]   dropping the iPad, and they've done this in the past,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.200]   dropping the iPad by $100, I think makes it very,
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   just leaves an area that I don't think anyone
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.520]   really wants to compete in.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.560]   - Well, they can always do that.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.920]   They can use an iPad or iPod shuffle strategy with this.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.040]   And basically, when Apple had the iPod
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.640]   and they said, well, yes, but it's so much more expensive
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.000]   and we've got, we've got still this area at the bottom
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.840]   that we can occupy.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.040]   - Yeah, Apple, when they come out with iPad too,
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.040]   could do what they've done with the iPhone,
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.360]   3GS and say, oh, now it's 99 bucks and for the iPad.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.560]   Okay, so now it's $400.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.520]   That's it.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.360]   I mean, you're done.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.040]   So you might as well just go home.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.560]   - A lot of it is, I think it's really curious
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.000]   to see the difference between the devices
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.560]   that I was seeing in January,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.080]   each and every one of which looked almost exactly
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.400]   like an iPad in terms of size and shape.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.280]   It seems as though one of the things
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.040]   that these competitors are experimenting with is,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.520]   is there an inconvenience factor to the size
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.360]   and would it be possible to make one that's about the size
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.240]   of a standard Kindle or paperback book,
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.280]   something that you could conceivably fit into a back pocket
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.240]   that people will respond to?
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.960]   And I think that's where we're gonna find $300 devices
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.720]   and that's gonna continue to kill the Kindle
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.480]   because Kindle always had an inexpensive price
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.120]   and high portability back on its side.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.880]   When you start to see a $350 or Android device,
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.320]   that's the exact same size screen,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.400]   only it's a color screen and also has Wi-Fi.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.480]   That's gonna be a big deal.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.840]   The second area is the ability to simply say,
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.800]   what if we are the one that gives you an SD card slot
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.640]   and we will give you a USB port
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.760]   and we will not have to wait for third party Bluetooth devices
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.920]   to come in in order to give us the simple ability
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.320]   to move a file in and off the pad?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.760]   Is that something people like?
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.720]   - Well, yeah, the horse is pulling away.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.360]   - And I know that for us, we're looking at,
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.000]   we're playing around with a lot of development right now
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.920]   in the office and one of the things that we're dealing with
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.000]   is the incredible effort that it would take
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.200]   to get Apple to approve a hardware connection
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.840]   to the iPad.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.640]   You know, that's not something people to talk about
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.120]   getting approved to put software in the App Store,
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.400]   it's at a whole different level to get hardware
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.520]   to be linked in and we've talked to some developers
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.600]   who have done it successfully,
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.760]   but it's no minor process and for us,
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.920]   when we wanna connect it to hardware,
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.800]   cameras or video cameras or still cameras
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.880]   and so on and so forth, trying to get that figured out,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.240]   like to us, there have been discussions
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.720]   that maybe we should just do this on Android
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.480]   because it would be easier to interconnect that
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.400]   and unless Apple streamlines that,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.040]   I think it could be a challenge for some markets.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.680]   - And I'm not sure you'll see that streamline,
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.480]   this has been a problem since the iPad.connector first appeared
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.200]   that people have been trying to get and use the
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.520]   dot connector port and Apple is very tough about that
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.560]   and it isn't just a matter of getting them to open up
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   but also they take a much higher cut of whatever it is,
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.640]   the device that you're selling to get in there.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.520]   So yeah, I wouldn't hold my breath.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.200]   If I were dealing with hardware and I really needed
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   device A to talk to whatever this tablet device is,
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.760]   I think Android certainly is the better way to go.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.560]   - Yeah, now another little piece of news here
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.400]   that I think some of us have been,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.240]   I didn't get the email,
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.000]   but some of us got an email that our information
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.160]   had been leaked.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.280]   So this was this kind of welled up over last weekend.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.480]   Can you give us a little bit more information
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.440]   about the AT&T leak?
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.040]   - Yeah, and I'm actually pulling up my own email right now
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.520]   because I did get one of those.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.840]   - Ooh.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.040]   - And I was sort of hoping that it was like press release
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.920]   as opposed to dear valued AT&T customer, please don't hit us.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.680]   Recently here there was an issue that affected
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.440]   some of our customers with AT&T 3.2 service for the iPad,
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.360]   please don't hit us.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.400]   Resulting in the release of the customer email addresses,
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.000]   please don't hit us.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.760]   Yeah, and so there are a couple of problems with it.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.280]   It gives, it's like about a seven rate paragraph letter
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.040]   that just simply says, here's what happened,
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.440]   a bunch of emails, email addresses got released
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.400]   on unauthorized way.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.320]   Here's how it happened.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.160]   We took swift action to print any further unauthorized exposure
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.720]   of customer email addresses within hours AT&T
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.840]   to disable the mechanisms automatically
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.520]   popularly, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.680]   But the big problem is that the problem was that they were,
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.880]   they had instituted a convenience feature
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.480]   that would automatically populate their email address
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.080]   in certain forms so that you wouldn't have to type it in
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.480]   yourself and that information was stored
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.120]   in a vastly unsecure manner.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.960]   And so paragraph number three in here,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.400]   after here's some additional detail, on June seven
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.240]   we learned that unauthorized computer hackers
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.120]   maliciously exploited a function designed
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.440]   to make your iPad login process faster.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.640]   Which is, first of all, that makes them think,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.440]   that makes the customer think that,
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.000]   wow, it was Matthew Broderick using a WarGames dialer
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.880]   and using a World War III computer
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.120]   in order to break these passwords.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.840]   No, it wasn't, it was a very, very badly implemented thing.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.480]   Secondly, it wasn't necessarily hackers that did it.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.880]   It was, there were hackers, but I believe that we're correct
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.640]   in thinking that these are white hat hackers
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.760]   who were saying, this is a problem,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.800]   you guys need to close this whole.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.440]   My understanding is that they only released this information
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.640]   to one journalist just to get the word out.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.760]   And they say that they deleted all the information
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.320]   that they collected.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.840]   A very embarrassing way to prove that there's a security hole.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.240]   I don't know much about exactly how this information
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.200]   was developed or making sure that the people
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.560]   who actually did this hack disposed of that stuff
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.280]   thoughtfully and responsibly.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.840]   But I don't think that they,
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.400]   I really think they should have left that part of it alone.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.280]   They should have said that there was an unanticipated
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.200]   and unknown security hole in the way
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.560]   that we populate this address.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.480]   As a result, they should have gone so far as to say,
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   here's how many iPads we have sold.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.280]   Here's how many email addresses we let out of the barn.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.840]   It is a small percentage of the total iPad 3G sold.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.920]   But nonetheless, it's a problem.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.320]   We wanna make sure that you know about this.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.800]   Your passwords weren't compromised,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.080]   your account information was not compromised.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.240]   However, we're to the wise, we're sorry, please don't hit us.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.040]   Remember that company that dumped all that oil
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.920]   and killed all those birds?
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.280]   We haven't killed any birds.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.840]   We're not British Petroleum, don't hit us.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.680]   - Not great.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.280]   And the thing is, is that people's, your ID, your iPad,
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.160]   and this isn't an Apple League, this is an AT&T League,
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.280]   your Apple, the ID for your iPad and your email.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.080]   Now, most of us have lost our email to some,
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.760]   some one of our friends having their email account hacked.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.640]   I think mine has been lost many times at this point.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.120]   So I think that that is not something
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.200]   that I would necessarily consider private private.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.120]   It's kind of like we kept the house door really, really well
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.800]   fortified and the porch.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.400]   And we didn't really lock the front screen.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.440]   You know, that seems to be more of it.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.200]   You know, is, but it's, you know, and it,
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.920]   there was, of course, the problem they had of the,
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.280]   some of the people that were affected, of course,
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.480]   were celebrities and more importantly, the military.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.120]   And so now we have the FBI looking into it mostly
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.160]   because there's probably some general who had his eye,
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.960]   who got that email and is perturbed
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.000]   and talking about the fact that we have, you know,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.560]   probably, you know, satellite imagery from Afghanistan
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.360]   on my iPad and is this safe?
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.080]   I mean, that seems to be the concern, Chris.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.280]   - Yeah, I feel a little left out.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.520]   They didn't steal my email.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   I didn't get that.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.400]   - You weren't part of the, of the, of the upset.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.240]   - I'm just not important enough to have my email address stolen
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   and I feel, well, I swore I wouldn't cry on camera.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.880]   So yeah, too bad.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.880]   - Yes, AT&T could certainly have taken a little more
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.840]   responsibility for this to say, oh, by the way, yes,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.600]   this was our fault and we're embarrassed that this happened.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.440]   Sorry.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.520]   And, but, and we swear we'll never do it again.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   - And, but there's no oil.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.600]   - And there's no oil.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.680]   - Yeah, right.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.080]   So up, we got, we have a couple more stories here
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.240]   before our picks.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   We've got Apple changing the development rules
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.920]   and also making it harder to advertise.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.400]   So that's coming up in just a second.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.480]   But before that, we want to thank our sponsor, Carbonite.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   Of course, Carbonite is the leader in online backup.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.680]   You can back up your PC or your Mac, of course, offsite,
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.840]   securely and automatically.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.920]   And you can get a, you know, for, you know,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.160]   the thing is is you got to start doing this.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.440]   You got to get your data off of the, you know, off the cloud
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.320]   and you know, into the cloud.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.720]   You have to get it off into the cloud
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.960]   because the thing is, is that,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.480]   is it's just not going to be safe at your house.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.320]   I mean, I know that when I travel a lot and, you know,
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.120]   I worry about this stuff.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.200]   I worry about it in our office.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.840]   I worry about it at my house.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.400]   So I always make sure that my stuff is, you know,
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.800]   the most important data, not everything.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.640]   I shoot a lot of heavy video and everything else.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.080]   But my most important photos, my music, my emails, you know,
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.120]   those types of things that I really want to keep,
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.600]   that I don't, that I don't want anything to happen to.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.000]   I got to have that backed up somewhere that is not my house
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.280]   and probably not anybody else's house.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.840]   And that's what Carbonite is great for.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.120]   So of course, you can back that stuff up.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.680]   You can recover loss files,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.560]   restore to previous versions of files.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.360]   So if you accidentally did something to the one on your,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.200]   on your drive.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.080]   And of course, you can transfer files from one computer
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.960]   to another.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.200]   You can access those backup, those backed up files
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.440]   from the Carbonite.com website from any computer
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.080]   or via their iPhone app.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.080]   So there's a lot of different ways to get to it.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.680]   Of course, it's secure.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.040]   So you can choose to encrypt it however you like.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.040]   And of course, now you're not worried about theft,
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.080]   fires, floods, and all kinds of other disasters
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.400]   that may be inflicted upon your home,
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.120]   but not in the cloud.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.040]   And again, I always say that it's two places in the office
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.720]   and one place in the cloud is really the best way
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.760]   to keep things backed up.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.800]   You can get unlimited backups as much as you want there
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.760]   for $5 a month.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:44.920]   And remember that when you use the coupon code TWIT,
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.120]   you can-- and I think-- actually, I don't think
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:47.640]   that that's right.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.880]   I think that we have Macbreak.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.520]   So you want to use your coupon code Macbreak.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.160]   And Macbreak is the-- if you use that,
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.560]   you're going to get two months for free.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.400]   So it's $5 a month, only $5 a month.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.840]   But you can get two months for free
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.160]   with if you use the coupon code Macbreak.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.040]   So definitely check that out.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.360]   And you've got to really be thinking about, I'm warning you.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.080]   As someone who's lost a lot of data,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.280]   you've got to be thinking about some kind of cloud backup
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.520]   because it's going to come to haunt you sooner, probably
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.880]   sooner than later.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:24.120]   So definitely check it out, carbonite.com.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:28.760]   And now we have our next little story here.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.800]   Apple changing the eye app development.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.360]   So Apple, of course, said that you
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:39.360]   can't use any third party tools to develop for the iPhone
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.240]   or iPad and to put it in the iStore.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:45.320]   And now it looks like they might have given just a little bit,
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.000]   Chris.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.040]   Yeah, they have given it a little bit.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.480]   I think it makes it clear that what Apple really meant
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.520]   was when they changed those rules, they said,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.920]   and we hate flash.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.080]   We really hate flash.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:02.000]   We are grinding flash under our corporate boot, no flash.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.040]   And again, please, no flash or Adobe tools
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.200]   to develop anything happening to a flash.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.080]   And it's a good idea, not so much to stomp Adobe
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   into the ground, but the initial rule
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.120]   was so broad that developers couldn't do certain things.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:19.600]   So they wanted to.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.360]   They need these other kinds of tools to do things,
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.480]   particularly game development.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.280]   If you look at what game developers
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.480]   do to produce the magic on their apps,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.920]   they have to do a lot of very tricky things.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.160]   And some of these rely on tools that maybe Apple, using
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.640]   this much broader generalization, they wouldn't
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.480]   be allowed to do.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.280]   Apple has since tweaked that, probably,
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.640]   from the feedback from developers saying, no, no, honestly,
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.440]   we need to use some other tools.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.440]   I swear we won't use Adobe tools anyway,
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.120]   but we do need to change other things
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.360]   so that we can produce apps that look really great
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.200]   on your devices.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.160]   And so it sounds like Apple's still not
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:01.520]   going to approve an app that is completely written
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.000]   in some other form.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.920]   What they're really allowing for on a case-by-case basis
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.640]   is the ability to add little bits of code that
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.920]   may not be built in Xcode.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.720]   Does this get-- does including these bits of code
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:23.120]   open a whole can of worms of censorship and slow approval?
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.120]   Andy?
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.040]   I don't know that I agree with that.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.160]   I think that every new piece of information
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.480]   we have about Apple's controls on developers
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.360]   is another piece of the puzzle that
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.680]   makes the puzzle harder to read, not easier to read.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.800]   I think that there are at least eight forces that apply
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.240]   to every single policy change that Apple makes.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.360]   Sometimes it's an absolute self-interest.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.320]   Sometimes it is just the idea of having
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.240]   a tidy and orderly platform.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:55.360]   And sometimes, when they're allowed for certain outside game
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.480]   platforms to suddenly be allowed in Xcode,
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.440]   they're realizing that, OK, we went a little bit too far.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.920]   We're going to back it off one notch or two.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.320]   But unfortunately, I've had to accept humility
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.640]   and understand that any time I try
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.760]   to understand any of Apple's motivations
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.160]   in setting their app store development--
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.600]   ha.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.720]   Or phosphoric acid.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   We're starting the show one hour early.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.040]   I had to be sharp at one in the afternoon.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.520]   I've never been up this early in my life.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.920]   I'm very, very sorry.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.360]   Anyway, I just think that it's a very complex system.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.720]   And the only thing that we know is that the system is kind
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.960]   of screwed up, and it will remain so for quite some time.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.520]   Sometimes not to everybody's benefit.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.560]   I know for me as a developer, it just seems
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.520]   like I'd be asking all kinds of trouble
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.120]   if I was going to start adding this stuff that would be one
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.480]   more reason for my app to spend that extra two months
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.320]   in the approval process.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.520]   And it seems like something I wouldn't do unless I really,
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:52.480]   really need to.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.440]   Maybe that's what Apple is trying to do,
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.360]   a set up situation like if you really, really need it,
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.480]   you can go ahead and add it.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.240]   And you need to know that it's going to take a little longer
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.240]   to go through.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:01.760]   But it's--
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:01.760]   Right.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.360]   And you can make your case as well.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:04.860]   Right.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.580]   So if you're somebody like EA or a Bager, a Carmack,
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.300]   or somebody like that who can make a significant impact
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.300]   on this device, I think at this point,
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.700]   you can make your case with Apple and say, look,
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.940]   we really are trying to stay as close to the letter of law
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.780]   as possible.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:22.380]   But we need X, Y, and Z to run on this
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.140]   so that our game is going to be terrific.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.180]   I think as little tiny developer,
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.540]   you don't have that kind of opportunity.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.180]   That's the whole point.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.340]   I think a key line in the keynote last week
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.660]   was that when he was telling me-- talking about the Apple's
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.300]   claims of the top three reasons why apps get rejected,
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.980]   and they're talking about use of third party
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.260]   outside frameworks, the line that these developers know
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.780]   exactly what they're doing.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.340]   I think that there seems to be a line drawn between,
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.300]   if we think that you want to use this technology to get
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:53.300]   around our limitations, then we're
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.620]   going to slap you down.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.700]   If you're trying to use this technology
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.780]   because it is absolutely necessary for the development
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:00.900]   of this app.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.180]   If it's going to narrow the scope of the app market
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:06.740]   instead of expand it, then we are
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.380]   amenable to saying, OK, we're going to look
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.380]   the other way on this one because clearly, the letter of the law
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:14.300]   is out of sync with the spirit of the law.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.620]   It seems like a lot of the concern.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.660]   I mean, obviously, there's some business concerns.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.500]   If you force people to only develop for your app--
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.060]   and customize it, number one is you get a better application.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.060]   You are going to definitely get a better application
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.460]   by having it developed specifically
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.580]   for that platform rather than develop for the lowest
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.820]   common denominator across six platforms.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:34.980]   So that's going to benefit you.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.900]   It's also, from a business perspective,
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.940]   making it very hard for Windows 7 to move in
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.500]   because people can't develop for both platforms.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.020]   They have to decide which one is going to be the biggest
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.780]   platform for them to develop for.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.460]   But I think also, technically, there's
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.660]   an issue of if we want to interrupt services,
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.260]   if we want to do stuff in the background,
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.580]   if we want to make sure that things are being started
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.580]   and stopped smoothly, it seems like using those external
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:01.740]   frameworks are the things that could really gum that up.
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.060]   Apple is giving you the frameworks that it controls
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.420]   so that it can do that in the background without having
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.020]   to ask you for permission.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.980]   That's one area in which I just don't agree with that.
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.540]   Apple does these things specifically
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.020]   to be anti-competitive and to retain control the market
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.940]   because it's such a complicated operating system
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.900]   and such a complicated development system.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.260]   If you're going to say that you're
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.380]   going to write a piece of software for the iPhone
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.540]   and then be able to simply cut and paste code directly
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:32.100]   off of your iPhone project and put into a Windows 7 project.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.220]   And that's going to be as simple.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.500]   You expect that to be a very simple and straightforward
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.500]   procedure.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   I don't know what world you learn to code in because even
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.780]   if you have this--
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:43.060]   unless you're using an interpreted language,
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.020]   that's not going to fly.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:46.460]   Even if you had Apple Basic and you're
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.420]   trying to convert it to Microsoft Basic,
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.940]   you're not going to be able to cut and paste.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.700]   And it goes beyond the fact that in 1984,
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.940]   you didn't have cut and paste on DOS.
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:54.460]   Right.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.260]   Absolutely.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:59.140]   Now also in the land of the threats of anti-competitive
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:03.780]   nature, Apple has changed some of its rules related to apps
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.660]   that use advertising.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.180]   So this is a--
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.940]   they're making it a little bit more difficult.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.660]   And basically, some of the new rules
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.460]   are stating that if you own a platform--
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.620]   Google--
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.780]   if you make hardware that is like a phone, Google,
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.740]   yeah, you can't have a lot of the data that you would normally
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.820]   have or that other developers may have.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.980]   Chris?
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.820]   Yeah, it smells bad.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.300]   It clearly looks like it's targeting AdMob, as you say.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.660]   It's Google because Apple was interested in them.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.780]   Google bought them.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.940]   And so they're saying, oh, sorry, AdMob, you're out.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.820]   And it does seem like a deliberate decision
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.140]   to cut them out.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.380]   But at the same time, that does sound like I'm wearing a tin hat.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:58.140]   So I'm going to defer to Andy on this one and let him state
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.660]   why this isn't evil.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.940]   Andy?
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.180]   Because there are complicated issues here.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.660]   Because when you--
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:10.940]   I imagine that you have two competing car companies.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.100]   And car company A has a technology built in.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.860]   So the product company B can take a look at every single car
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.060]   the competitor is making, every single feature
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.740]   they're putting into it, every single thing
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.780]   that they're developing it for future models.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.140]   Not only that, but also how all of the competitors
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.420]   are users are using their devices.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.660]   That's a lot of valuable inside information
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:35.500]   for a company to have.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.340]   So if Google wanted to-- let's say that I
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.820]   know that Google went to all that trouble of writing out
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.540]   the statement, we're not evil.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.260]   And I know that their legal repercussions,
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.660]   if they do anything that's evil, because they've actually
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.620]   written that out as part of their mission statement,
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.420]   let's just be fantasies here.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.340]   And assume that they're a large, huge,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.620]   Golgothical corporation that's interested in being
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.980]   a mega-golgothical corporation.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.700]   And they can simply say, you know what?
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:04.100]   Through our ad system, we can get a list of every single device
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.540]   that's on the Apple campus.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.740]   Not only that, but we can find out
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.740]   how every single iPhone user is using their device,
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.820]   how every single iPad user is using their device,
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.420]   and use that to decide how we can best
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.820]   develop a machine or an operating system feature that
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.380]   will directly compete with that.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:24.500]   So when we talk about selfish reasons for Apple
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.460]   to put that kind of limitation on,
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.140]   it is a selfish reason for them not
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.180]   to want to give up what could be considered trade secrets
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.340]   to the enemy.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.660]   But it kind of makes sense for them to want to do that.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.020]   Now, there's a user--
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.740]   Apple would probably couch it more in terms
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.580]   of a user experience where we don't necessarily
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.700]   open to lower the drawbridge to simply say,
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.340]   you can harvest any information you want about our users
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.500]   and profile them any way you wish.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.620]   That's a not inconsequential benefit.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.180]   But I have to believe that they're
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.140]   more concerned about, again, a direct competitor
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.780]   to the iPhone using that kind of a hole
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.340]   to get so much information for free on all of their users
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.060]   that Apple would be at a huge disadvantage.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.620]   And the thing that would be--
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.100]   a lot of people talk about antitrust and anti-competitive
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.380]   nature and so on and so forth.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.940]   And the FTC should look at this.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.980]   But it seems like it would be hard
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.420]   to say that Google is a small company being oppressed.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.380]   Would you agree, Chris?
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.940]   Well, yeah, I think that there's a--
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.580]   I mean, where's the line between being a tough competitor
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.180]   and anti-competitive?
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.740]   Google is huge.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:33.380]   So I think they would have a hard time walking in
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.940]   with sort of a shabbily dressed attorney,
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.500]   because that's all they can afford.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.900]   He's like, look what they're doing to us.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:40.300]   And we--
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.580]   They're not going to get Aaron Brockovich to represent them.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.020]   Exactly.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.940]   You can't be like Jim's Five and Dime
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.180]   with having Walmart move in next to you
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.180]   and putting an extension hanging over your shop.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.140]   It's a big company.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.380]   And we have big people on each side of this one.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.020]   So I think it's going to be a tough case
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.620]   to make that Apple is shutting out poor little Google.
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.940]   I mean, in some ways, aren't these things
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.100]   from a monopoly or antitrust situation?
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.780]   I think we've talked about this a little bit in the past.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.620]   But all of these things revolve around.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.500]   This is the time that if Apple's going to set these rules,
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.060]   they have to set them now when they are in the majority,
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.460]   when they're in the minority, when they're theoretically
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.740]   fragile, vulnerable, in the market,
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.260]   where when they get to a point--
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.060]   if they got to a point with 70%, 80% of the market,
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.380]   they couldn't do these rules.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.180]   I mean, they couldn't shut people out if they get larger.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.380]   I mean, isn't that part of the strategy that
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.780]   has to be going on here?
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.300]   That's a good point.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.060]   But I think that this point--
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.700]   it's less of an antitrust thing and more of a thing of,
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.980]   let's keep the doors closed before the horses leave the barn.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.420]   Right.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:49.900]   Right.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.900]   Now, the other little thing that Apple added
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.300]   without talking about it at all--
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.180]   I mean, so we didn't see much of it in the keynote.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.260]   We were all talking about iPhones and iPads.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.940]   And Apple slipped out Safari 5 with Reader.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.580]   And now that Reader has started to sink in,
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.140]   some people aren't completely happy about the whole situation,
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.100]   Chris.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.620]   Yeah, there's this issue that Reader
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.500]   will present the user with a very nice formatted page
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.060]   with just the text on it.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.420]   And all those ads, they get in the way
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.100]   that make you move your eye over here instead of being able to go
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.940]   straight down the page, seem to be gone.
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:33.780]   And I, as a user, like it a lot.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.300]   I also happen to work for a company
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.740]   that depends on ad revenue from websites.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.300]   And even though all of us who work there
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.180]   kind of like the idea, there is the question of people
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:47.020]   who operate websites who say, but the reason we have so much
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.860]   of this free content on the web is because there are ads.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.540]   And if Apple looks like, well, no, we're
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.180]   just going to strip all those ads out.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.620]   So it'll make a better user experience.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.460]   That concerns people that are trying to make a living off this.
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.260]   Andy, is this completely user driven?
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.060]   Is Apple just trying to make it easier for the user?
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.620]   Or is there some deeper plot?
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.340]   I don't think there's a deeper plot.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:12.940]   I think that it was just a cool feature that got shown that--
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.220]   if I'm going to take a guess, and this is a guess only,
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.660]   this is a feature that somebody inside the team wrote
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.220]   because they thought it was a cool feature.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.140]   The right person happened to see it and said, wow, that's great.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.900]   We're putting that in Safari 5.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.620]   And then a great many people shocked.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.460]   It became a bullet item on the box feature of Safari 5.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.580]   It is-- it's not the first time this problem has really popped up.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.020]   There's a tool that I recommend highly to lots of people
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.660]   who like to read comic strips called the Dark Gate Comics
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.620]   Slurper that if you have online comic strips that
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.780]   don't have an RSS feed necessarily,
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:49.900]   it will figure out how to get the comic strip off of that page
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.860]   and aggregate it all of your favorite comics
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.180]   onto one scrolling page.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.620]   And there are links back to the original.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.540]   So if you want to go back to the original site,
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.900]   you can take a look at it.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.060]   It really is, for me, the only way that I can read all the comics
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.660]   I want without having a bookmark 20, 30, or 40 sites.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.180]   And the argument against it is, of course,
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.900]   they support themselves by ad clicks and ad revenues.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.540]   And if you divorce all this free content
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.500]   from the mechanisms that causes the artist to be able to support
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.020]   themselves, that turns into a problem.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.380]   But the other thing is that I really
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.180]   think that this is a case of the web
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:29.340]   is built on having to release yourself from counting on how
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:33.340]   this-- the whole part-- when you put something on the web,
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.340]   you understand that you can't control
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.620]   how someone is going to view this.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.100]   What kind of browser they're going to use?
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.500]   What kind of plugins they're going to turn off?
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.700]   If they're going to have a plugin that modifies your content?
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.580]   If it's going to turn your text to white on black
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.820]   instead of that beautiful mauve on peach
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.820]   that you designed via CSS.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.140]   And if you don't like that, then you
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.020]   need to find a different way of publishing things.
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.860]   And the bottom line, though, I think, is that I would hope
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.980]   that if I've created my website in such a way
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.580]   that someone needs a special tool to access it and read it
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.460]   in the way that they want, that I'm not delivering that to them,
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.740]   my response should be I'm going to redesign my site
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.580]   to make sure that people are going to read it the way they want.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.660]   If I've got so much wickety-wack on my website
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.380]   that people want to strip it all away and use reader,
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.660]   then I think that means I need to go back to the drawing board.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.780]   For me, when I look at it, I mean, I
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.700]   have to admit, the Google reader, the moment that I saw it.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.460]   I think it's Command Shift R.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.180]   And I just find myself just immediately going up
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.300]   to a website in Command Shift R. And especially the one
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.540]   that single page versions I don't really think about it
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.460]   as much.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:42.140]   But as soon as I see, oh, this is going to be a three page
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.060]   or four page or five page piece, I immediately
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.180]   hit Command Shift R because I don't want to deal with the reload.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.300]   And as someone who does research for these shows,
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.140]   so as we do research on the show,
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.540]   we used to use a program called WebStractor.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:58.740]   And then it was this huge process to get rid of all--
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.660]   it was still like you'd copy the page,
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.660]   and then you'd delete all the pieces,
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.940]   and then you'd do all this other stuff.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.820]   And now you hit Command Shift R, and then there's
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.620]   a little button at the bottom that says email.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.900]   Or I want to save it, print it.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.340]   It's like printed directly to a PDF.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.620]   I've been using that to put things on my iPad.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.100]   And so the thing is, is that it is so fast and so easy.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.460]   It seems like, though, the timing is a little scary
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.780]   because you're talking about at the same time
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.340]   that the I-ads are coming out.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.860]   I mean, it's a shot to the I-ads seem to be a shot to the head,
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.700]   and the reader seems to be a leg sweep.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.540]   I'm not sure that part of its basic function
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:43.420]   is intentionally to cut out ads because I have clicked that button
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.980]   and saw ads kind of discreetly tucked away on the bottom.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.420]   I'm wondering if the Apple, either directly or just
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.220]   by not protecting their whole card too well,
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.460]   is going to-- if people who are upset by this
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.700]   are going to find a way to redesign their sites,
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.980]   not to disable reader, but to make sure there's a way
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.740]   that their ads can be tucked away on the bottom.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:08.740]   Like if they can simply sense that browser type is Safari 5.reader,
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.180]   then it will spit out a different version of it
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.540]   in which all the important ads, like the Google Ads, the keyword ads,
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.380]   are sort of either at the very, very top or at the very, very bottom
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.740]   so that they at least get credit for review.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.180]   Well, and I think the other thing is,
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.980]   is that when you look at-- if they added them as pictures,
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.860]   if they added the ads as pictures,
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.580]   those things still show up within the ad reader.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.620]   The problem with them is, is they're not dynamic.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.660]   So what it's doing is stripping out a lot of the dynamic tools
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.060]   that they had to make that actually work.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:36.980]   So it's--
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:41.020]   No more leprechauns barfing out dollar signs for my home refinance
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.220]   at, well, somehow I'll struggle to go along.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:48.060]   Chris, do you think this is the end of web publishing?
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.380]   No, no, I don't think so.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.300]   I think, as Andy says, people will adapt to this somehow.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.980]   And you don't find a way to deliver content.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.820]   You can see fewer and fewer albums behind you.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.620]   Week after week, we'll see fewer and fewer albums behind you
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.940]   as you sell off your collection to buy food for your children.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.420]   Exactly right.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.100]   I'm just showing the rare ones now,
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.540]   because I know those are the ones that are going to go first.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.300]   Now, last but not least, we had a--
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.940]   there was Adobe-- it was one of the things we saw.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.820]   Wired, the Wired Magazine came out.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.540]   And sold a lot of copies on its first couple days.
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.980]   And it came out the week before last,
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.020]   but I think we weren't talking about it all last week.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:33.860]   But the-- so Adobe now has also released some of the tools.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.300]   Now, they haven't released them to the public.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.580]   They're really being released to publishers and so on and so forth
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:45.020]   to allow them to build their documents inside of InDesign
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:48.540]   and then simply publish to the iPad.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.700]   Number one is, do we think this is going
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:51.740]   to be a solid solution?
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.260]   There's a lot of people to talk about the size and the format
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.620]   of the Wired piece.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.620]   And do we think this is going to be something that's
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.700]   going to eventually trickle down to just being
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.340]   installable with your InDesign?
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.180]   Chris?
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.940]   I think we'll be installed, but I have to think
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.780]   that Apple should be working on the solution and not Adobe.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.660]   I know that lots and lots of publishers--
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.660]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:18.300]   No, no, it seems like I'm kind of amazed that we don't see pages
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.220]   and outputting directly to the iPad that we don't see DVD Studio
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.780]   Pro sending out.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.820]   I mean, no one-- Apple doesn't believe in plastic anymore.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.620]   Why are we even-- why don't we even have DVD Studio Pro
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.740]   if we're not going to export interactive stuff
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.140]   to the iPad, in my opinion?
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.180]   But it does seem surprising that Apple hasn't taken a lead
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.540]   on this, but this is the beginning.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.100]   Well, there's certainly a market for it.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.580]   I know that when this was first announced,
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:47.940]   every author I knew, publishing company agent
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.780]   was talking about having direct control,
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.660]   being able to get stuff into the iBook store
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.980]   and get stuff on the iPad directly.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:58.060]   And I think when we first heard about it, we thought, oh, well,
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.780]   of course, Apple's going to come up with something
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.780]   and provide these tools for us.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.740]   And great, we can all self-publish,
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:06.220]   like we can put music on the site while we can sell various things
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.300]   to the App Store.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.580]   And yet they've been silent on this, basically.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.020]   You know, say, well, yeah, we support EPUB.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.780]   That's not the answer.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.300]   We want interactive stuff.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.420]   And you're really going to send us to Adobe to do this?
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.820]   I don't think that's the answer.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.500]   Well, and I talked to--
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.140]   I was sitting next to a person who
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.460]   does a lot of publishing for cooking books and everything
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:27.740]   else.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.940]   And they said, from their perspective,
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.860]   if you have a very pictorial-driven book that
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.340]   has a lot of stuff that you really
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.020]   want to have precise formatting, that the EPUB formats,
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.020]   doing the stuff through iBooks,
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.540]   that's not a solution for them.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.620]   That's not a solution that they want.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:45.580]   They want to be able to design their own solutions.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.100]   And right now, everyone's just writing their own apps
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:49.860]   to make that happen.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.060]   And it's ugly.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.540]   And I think that this is a real--
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.860]   it's not an issue yet.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.940]   But it seems like it's going to become a building issue
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.420]   if Apple doesn't take a hold of the process.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.380]   It might be a technology--
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.540]   I know that a half hour ago, I was talking about how you can't
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.060]   build an application and expect to simply cut and paste it
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.220]   onto other platforms.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.220]   But that is absolutely what newspapers and magazines
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.620]   really want to do, especially because they
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.460]   take a certain amount of pride in how they present their pages.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:19.340]   That's part of the signature of their magazine.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:22.300]   And if you try to present them with the idea where
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:26.700]   we're going to give you a beautiful design solution that
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:31.580]   lets you develop an absolutely wonderful HTML5-based dynamic
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.260]   magazine that can only be read on this one device.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.940]   And you'll have to be started again from square
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:37.340]   run every single month if you want
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.700]   to develop for any other device.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.180]   That might not go over well.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.300]   Whereas Adobe, being the producer of the tools
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.580]   that all those design departments are already familiar with,
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.260]   if you give them the ability to simply say,
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.220]   I'll burn off one copy for the iPad,
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.260]   I'll burn off another copy for the Google Pad,
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:55.820]   I'll burn off a third copy for the HP webOS pad,
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.260]   that is a workable solution for those people.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:04.460]   But I got to believe that if Apple built a really compelling,
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.420]   easy to use development platform for the iPad,
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.820]   while they're ahead--
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.620]   while there isn't a lot of competition out there,
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.820]   this would be another industry that they could start to lock up
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.300]   because it's the big industry.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.780]   And if they made it easy, I mean, I
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:18.180]   be developing all of our stuff for the iPad.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.100]   And I wouldn't care about the other platforms.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.420]   I wouldn't care about doing other stuff
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.740]   if I had an easy way to do it.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.900]   But right now, it feels like if I want
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.980]   to add all those interactive pieces--
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.140]   and it feels like DVD Studio Pro or Pages
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:30.500]   or the mixture of the two.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.220]   Pages already let you bring in movies.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.060]   It lets you add clickable items or keynote.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.180]   Keynote being able to build these kind of things,
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:41.660]   it seems like all the applications are so close
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.620]   to being able to just output an incredible experience
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.100]   and just not there.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.180]   And it just seems like a lot of people
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.780]   would be developing that kind of content
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.740]   if those tools were a little easier.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.420]   If you didn't feel like you had to learn Xcode to produce it.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.380]   I mean, that's like expecting the Wall Street Journal
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.780]   to use just your basic off-the-shelf word processor
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.740]   for all of their layout and all their compositing.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.900]   Their needs are particular and peculiar to each publication
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:11.140]   that are not going to be served by an app like Pages.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.780]   It can be fined for individual stringers submitting articles
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.900]   and submitting content.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.380]   But when you get one step upstream closer to--
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:23.060]   downstream closer to the reader, any large publication
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.700]   is going to want something that is at least 30% custom
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.820]   to exactly their needs.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.220]   Oh, no, I completely agree with it
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.020]   that for large publications, this makes sense.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.300]   The my thing is is that everybody
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.660]   would be doing it for their iPad.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.980]   You know, schools and small companies
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.740]   and small publishers and everything else
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:44.660]   if they could have an easy development platform to do it on.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.940]   And right now, it's not clear where Adobe's going.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.380]   Now, the other thing is, the other complaint
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.660]   is that basically what people are saying about the Adobe one
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:54.180]   is that it's building basically two different pages.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.260]   It's not the most efficient.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.860]   You know, the Wired app, I think, was 500--
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.060]   500 megs.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.740]   It's not the most efficient way to get--
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.500]   it's the easiest way to do it.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.180]   But it's definitely not the most efficient.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:09.060]   It's kind of like building your website in Dreamweaver
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.980]   where it's-- you know, it works.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:15.900]   It's easy, but it's not necessarily the cleanest code.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.500]   So we'll see how that--
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.180]   we'll see how that goes.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.580]   I'm very excited that Adobe's doing it.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.980]   I just hope-- and I hope that I get a chance to play with it
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.700]   because we definitely want to develop and customize stuff
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.500]   for the iPad, not even for general release,
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.940]   but just for our members, just for people who are watching.
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.260]   And it just-- to us, we just want something easy
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:35.580]   that we can publish to, not something
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.220]   that we're going to build a huge engine around.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.300]   You know, and that's the best--
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.380]   Well, if I have one worry about it,
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:44.660]   it's that I hope that these tools don't lock designers
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.740]   into thinking, well, that's great.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.980]   We'll just take the magazine that we have right now
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:51.060]   and reproduce the page model on the iPad
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:54.780]   instead of developing something brand new that's specifically
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.420]   tailored to the idea of holding a slate in your hand
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.020]   that's not only touchable, not only
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.860]   has an infinite page count, not only infinite page size,
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.300]   but also can be contacting the mothership with every page
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.900]   turned to keep modifying itself to suit the needs.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.900]   If that's why the Alex--
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.260]   I'm sorry, not the Alex reader.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.660]   But there's the--
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.860]   Yes, I'd like to read a lot.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.300]   I read out loud for everyone.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.740]   They call it the Alex reader.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.780]   It's Alex.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:20.980]   The Alex reader would be wonderful.
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.660]   It would be specific.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.740]   It would be spectacular.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.380]   But there are other competing of--
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:31.180]   News Corp has just bought out the big famous huge magazine
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.940]   size page, E-ank reader, where the whole point
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.540]   is to make electronic publications that look exactly
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:42.460]   like their new stand equivalent, which is just like saying,
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.660]   we're going to make a car, and the engine is going
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.980]   to be shaped like a horse.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.700]   And it's going to have feet that sort of propel it forward.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.380]   And that's-- I'm not sure if you're
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:54.980]   getting this whole wheel on an axle sort of thing that really
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.420]   moves things a lot faster than hoes on cobblestones.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.740]   Well, it's kind of like-- but that's the way film started.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.540]   We've talked about this in the past, where we put a bunch of cameras
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.900]   up and shot people on stages.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.580]   And then about 1910 or 1912, they were like, what if we--
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.460]   I think they got naked.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.940]   We could move the camera around.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.380]   Yeah, we could move the camera around,
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:16.620]   and then we could start and stop and not
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.620]   shoot the whole thing all at one time.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.300]   And it seems like people kind of attached that stuff.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.980]   I do think that-- and some people in the chat room
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:28.540]   have been talking about using PDFs that are--
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.900]   you could just put PDFs on your iPad, which is true.
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.100]   The problem is is that what you really
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.140]   want to do is develop all these interactive titles,
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.180]   develop all these interactive pieces to it,
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.500]   and have tools that really let you do that effectively.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.980]   And that's the thing that I think is not there yet.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.540]   So we'll see how that goes.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:51.020]   And before-- and it's time to move on to our Audible pick
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.700]   for the week, of course, Audible.com
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:57.580]   is the leading provider of audiobooks, 75,000 titles.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.020]   And you can get anything, whether it's literature,
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.180]   or fiction, or nonfiction, periodicals, all
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.500]   of that stuff's available.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:08.620]   I know that as many people have heard before, for me,
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.420]   I listen to long form.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.540]   If it's fiction, I'm watching it on a movie.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.700]   If it's not what I call linear nonfiction,
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.140]   I just listen to it.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:23.620]   The only thing I buy in print is really reference material,
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.660]   which I've now started to get on my Kindle app.
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.860]   And so the thing is that I've kind of been able to move
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:32.420]   into that electronic world, and Audible's a big piece of it.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.300]   Of course, you can get a free book.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.900]   And if you are thinking about getting a free book,
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:42.180]   Andy, most likely, has a suggestion.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.620]   Yeah, I've got an interesting one.
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.700]   This is a book that I just downloaded two days ago.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.380]   And I am now about three hours into it.
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.620]   And it's about, I believe, 12 to--
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.980]   I think it's like a 15-hour uncut version of the book.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:01.460]   It is Hitch 22 Memoir by Christopher Hitchens.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.740]   Now, I'm recommending it for two reasons.
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:10.100]   I'm giving you one warning at the end of that.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.220]   It's one of the strong entries I'm looking for in an audiobook,
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.500]   because it is a memoir.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:19.420]   It's about this kind of cantankerous political,
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.220]   who's had lots of very, very nicely worded opinions
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.900]   and nicely formed opinions.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:26.180]   And he's essentially telling stories from his life,
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.620]   and some of them are a little bit self-serving.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.020]   But it's always really, really interesting.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:32.500]   The big deal is that it's episodic in nature.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.380]   So it's not as though you really have to keep driving
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.060]   and driving and driving every single day
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.900]   so you don't forget what happened yesterday.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.940]   You can really dip in and dip out of it as you go.
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.340]   And every single one of these chapters
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.860]   is like a long-form essay.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.100]   It's not just, here's what happened.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.220]   Here's what I went.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.740]   Here's who I met.
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.660]   It's just, here's what I was thinking at the time.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.420]   Here's what helped shape my thinking
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.140]   as I became older and older.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.780]   And he grew up in the '60s, so, hey, yeah, baby.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.940]   So there's those two things going for it.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.460]   Now, there's one negative going for it.
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.500]   And here's where you're going to appreciate the fact
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.700]   that Audible lets you preview just about everything
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.340]   with a very, very, very, very, very long excerpt
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:14.260]   that you can play right from the site.
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:18.500]   Hitchens has the problem of, well, let's not call it a problem.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.460]   Let's call it a difference.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.380]   Well, let's, of being English.
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.380]   Let's listen.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.620]   We can listen to it here.
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.420]   Go ahead.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:32.140]   The problem is that not that he has an accent, it's that--
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.060]   He talks like this, and then sometimes stops and starts.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.420]   And then sometimes he will go like this,
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.620]   and then talk a little bit more slowly.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:43.220]   But then he gets into the--
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.220]   So there it is.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.940]   In cold print, the plain, on a dawn phrase that will one day
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.980]   become unarguably true.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.180]   It's not given to everyone to read of his own death,
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.820]   let alone when announced in passing in such a matter of fact
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.300]   way.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.900]   As I write, in the dying months of the year 2008,
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:04.220]   having just received this reminder note from the future,
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:07.020]   that future still contains the opening of the exhibition
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.060]   and the publication of the--
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.420]   So that's what you're-- this is kind of the stop-start method
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.900]   of that process.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.140]   He mumbles a lot.
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:16.100]   I really don't think that he was the best person
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.500]   to read this book.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.580]   I will be honest, if not for the fact
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.220]   that I had already bought and paid for it.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:26.780]   When I took it out for the drive on Sunday,
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.860]   I almost bailed on it about 15 minutes in,
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.260]   because I was just missing so much of this.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.740]   I stuck with it, and it got better-- or maybe my ear
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.620]   got better tuned to his speech patterns.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.020]   So definitely be aware of that.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:43.580]   Listen to a good five minutes worth of the preview.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.780]   If you don't have a problem with it,
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:46.980]   the text itself is very, very interesting,
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.300]   other than that.
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.340]   Just make sure you go in with your ears wide open.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:51.860]   Very good.
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.740]   And if you want to, of course, get that, you can--
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.060]   let me pop this up here.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:00.300]   If you are interested in Audible,
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.980]   and whether it's that pick or another pick,
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.300]   almost everything that you can think of is up there.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.060]   I mean, just about every book that I
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.260]   think of other than reference books, which you would really--
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.300]   I don't think you'd really want to listen to--
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:16.300]   the audible.com/macbreak, go check it out.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.780]   And find a book of your own.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.860]   If you haven't done this already, the first book is free.
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.660]   So there's no reason not to go up there and get a free book.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.660]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:28.060]   So definitely check that out.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:33.340]   And it's just a whole different little world.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.580]   I just-- I clean to it.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:36.100]   I work on the yard work to it.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.340]   I am sitting planes to it.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.180]   So it's definitely worth checking out.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.860]   And so now, without further ado,
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.300]   we're going to move to the picks of the week.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.460]   Chris, do you have a pick for us?
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.420]   I do.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:53.220]   My pre-pick is given my experience today for "Rison"
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.380]   for anything and everything.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:57.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.740]   By the way, did you see-- wait, before we move forward
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.180]   to the picks of the week, this was someone
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.300]   that someone brought up in the chat room.
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.740]   Did you see the MIFI hack for the iPad?
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:07.220]   No.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.700]   Someone has figured out how to take their MIFI, disassemble it,
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.620]   and install it into their iPad so that they can actually
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.780]   have a MIFI in their iPad.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.100]   And it actually works.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.820]   Very nice.
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.980]   So you can do this over.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.300]   I'm all over that.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:29.820]   Do you think that inside Apple, someone
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:33.380]   has actually printed this out, pasted it onto a big board,
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.540]   and just shoved it into someone's face, saying, now
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.380]   do you understand that we have a problem?
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.620]   This is not the act of someone who
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:44.100]   is happy with their AT&T service.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.620]   I have to admit, I saw that hack this morning,
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:50.700]   and I was so tempted to tear my--
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.500]   I was like, this might be a weekend project
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.700]   taking this thing apart.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.860]   And I have to keep on thinking about it.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.700]   I have a MIFI.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:00.820]   I have an iPad that doesn't have 3G.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.860]   Should I bond these guys together?
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.340]   And it may happen.
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.380]   I may need a little technical assistance, but I've got it.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.020]   It's like the premise.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:08.540]   It's like the premise.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.380]   It's like the premise.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.380]   It's like the premise.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.020]   It's a bit harder, but it's effective.
[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:12.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:14.220]   So Chris, you're picking--
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.700]   Oh, my real pick.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.700]   My real pick is an application called--
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.500]   I don't know if you can see with a glare.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.700]   It's called Lyric's Plus.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.580]   It's two bucks.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.860]   And it's for finding lyrics on the web.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.820]   And this could be lyrics that-- for songs
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.500]   that you have in your music collection or lyrics
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.300]   that you're searching for.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.180]   Specifically, something happened with Lyric's a while ago
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.660]   is that there was a main site called Lyric Wiki
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.300]   that people would go to to get Lyric's.
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:45.940]   They managed to get an all the Lyric's you would ever
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.820]   need to find on the web.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.940]   And the people who were in charge of making money off
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.940]   Lyric's found out about it, went over there and said,
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.700]   no, you don't.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:59.060]   So they shut off this capability to share the database
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:01.140]   with applications.
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:05.260]   But if you were a noble mind, you actually
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:07.860]   contacted this governing body and said,
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:10.660]   we would like to license this stuff and pay for it.
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.380]   And so a few app developers have been able to do with that.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:15.460]   And Lyric's Plus is one of them.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.660]   It's made by Schroeder Development LLC.
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.660]   Again, it's two bucks.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.420]   It's on the App Store.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.820]   It's not available for the iPad and an iPad native version.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.860]   But it works perfectly well on the iPad.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.540]   It looks good scaled up.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.940]   And it's very fast.
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.580]   And plus, you can play your songs
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.580]   from your music collection directly
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.260]   within the application.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.100]   If you like lyrics, if you want to know what the singers are
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.700]   saying, it's absolutely worth the $2.
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.020]   I love having lyrics.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.260]   I mean, there's a lot of times, I can't understand what they're
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:42.540]   saying.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.780]   I think I'm just too old for certain lyrics anymore.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.460]   And I remember the old ones that they slowly sink in.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:51.940]   And it's amazing how you see how sometimes with some songs,
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:52.980]   it's not important because there's
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.380]   songs that I've loved for a long time
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:57.380]   that I have absolutely no idea what they're saying.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.380]   Right.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:02.020]   And then when you actually read them, you're like, oh, I didn't.
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:02.540]   Yeah, I didn't.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.540]   That didn't completely sink in.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.220]   Anyway, I'm a lyric fiend.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.020]   So I'm definitely getting that.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.620]   Andy, do you have a pick for the week?
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.460]   Yes, it is an iPad accessory.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:14.700]   Then here is my iPad.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.700]   I'm going to be doing something quite magical with it
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.460]   that you will see in just a second.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:22.820]   It's the amazing levitating iPad.
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:26.940]   Because I've got this thing called the X band by TKO Solutions.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:32.620]   It is essentially S&M bondage gear for your iPad.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:35.500]   But it's like four very nicely done leather straps
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.220]   that hook into the corners and hold it very securely.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.180]   And a new preen back to it that still
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.340]   shows the Apple logo.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.460]   I have a sticker over mine, but it would show you the Apple
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.340]   logo.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:47.340]   So those of you who are worried, like if you tend to use it
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.660]   and like standing up and walking around sort of places,
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:54.540]   it really sticks it to your hand like very, very nicely.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.620]   You can do it that way.
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.820]   You can do it horizontally.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.180]   I prefer to sort of hold it kitty corner like that.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:01.700]   And that's why the hole is there not just
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.420]   to have brand logo awareness, but also
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:07.780]   so that you can hold it on the diagonal like that.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.100]   And it's actually very, very, very handy.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:11.780]   I'm surprised at how often--
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:15.620]   I got the guy who designed it, sent it to me about a month ago.
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.860]   And I had it with me on that Mac many cruise.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.940]   And I was surprised to find how many--
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.820]   how often I was actually using it.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.740]   Because I do like to have a certain tactile control
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.500]   over the iPad.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.020]   And this sort of prevented me from worrying about it being
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:28.700]   dropped.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:30.780]   But one of the nicest features of it-- and this
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.300]   avoids one of the problems that I tend to have
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.260]   with a lot of different iPad cases and solutions--
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:37.860]   is that when you take it off--
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:41.460]   I mean, it's just cloth so that you can just simply sort of fold
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.620]   it up and stick it in a pocket.
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:44.140]   So when you're not using it, it just
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:46.460]   doesn't take up any space whatsoever.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.900]   Nor does it screw up the nice lines of your iPad.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:52.220]   And for all that, it is 1999, which
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.540]   doesn't seem like a whole lot of money to me.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:57.180]   And the guy is just getting started.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.540]   I was going to recommend this a couple of weeks ago,
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.140]   but he's just only now gotten his website up and going.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:07.740]   And you can get it at tko-solutions.com.
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:12.100]   But as in the last three letters of my name, I just noticed.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.820]   So tko-solutions.com.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.660]   It jumps straight to cowbell.
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:18.300]   Oh, there we go.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:18.660]   Hold on.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.700]   There we go.
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:26.420]   When you type it in, here's the picture of the website.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:29.820]   When you type it in here, if you look at the URL,
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:33.340]   it says tk-solutions.com/cowbell.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.780]   So evidently, it's just a matter of having enough cowbell.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.060]   So again, in hand or on hand, is it on hand?
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.500]   I think the product is called the X-band.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:42.820]   OK.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.860]   I'm not sure if the on hand is the name of the company
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.540]   that he's set up to actually sell them.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.860]   The on hand by--
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:51.100]   I'm reading it-- on hand by tko-solutions
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:52.980]   introduced in the X-band.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.980]   Very good.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.380]   Looks like a great--
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:55.900]   Go ahead.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.860]   I think it-- yeah, I was just about to say.
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.780]   I mean, it's handier than you think it might be.
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.220]   But if you're the sort of person who's kind of active
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.220]   with their iPad, it's the sort of thing
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:08.020]   that if you just have that in your pocket and your bag,
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.260]   you're probably going to have that on and working using it
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:10.580]   a lot.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.220]   I've been using it a lot more.
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.340]   I thought it was a cool little thing that just wanted to try out.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.980]   And I thought, oh, well, that'll be fun for a day.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:17.180]   And they'll probably never use it again,
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:17.860]   or I'll give it away.
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.100]   But no, actually, I've been using it quite regularly.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.020]   I actually have a perfect pairing, a perfect pairing
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.820]   for your little attachment there.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:28.380]   Because that looks like the perfect thing to go with my pick,
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.340]   which is a--
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:32.860]   this is a little bit of a--
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.940]   this is a film geek app.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.900]   And this is-- here it is.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.780]   It's a little blown out when you actually see it.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:40.540]   But this is called Movie Slate.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.500]   And I saw this.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.980]   I think we covered it a little bit at Macworld.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.620]   And you can't see some of the pieces here.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.460]   I think it's a little--
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:50.740]   if I turn it just a little bit there,
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:51.780]   you can kind of see the--
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.660]   it was a little overexposed on the camera.
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.060]   But what you have here is a smart slate.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:00.100]   Now, I need to qualify something for people.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.420]   A smart slate is something that costs a lot of money.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:05.460]   These are $1,500 each.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.740]   And a company called Denicke makes the ones that
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.140]   are probably the most popular.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:13.180]   And when I saw this at NAB, I was like, oh, they should be so
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:13.740]   frightened.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.660]   Because this is really-- to me, this
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:19.780]   is the future of where apps are going, which is really taking
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:24.020]   over things that used to be complex code that was really
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:24.820]   like LEDs.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.380]   I mean, they're really low quality.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.900]   You're like, I can't believe I'm paying $1,400
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:30.940]   for these little spinning LEDs.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.620]   And here you have something that does--
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.620]   just about everything that a slate does, really everything
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:37.300]   that a slate does and a lot more.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:41.140]   The date you can just say, oh, I just want that to be today.
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.980]   I don't have to write any of that stuff in.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.620]   It keeps track of your role scenes.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.220]   You don't have to remember a lot of that stuff.
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.660]   You can type the stuff in.
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:51.660]   I can't tell you how many times I've been on a set.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:54.020]   And you can't read anything that someone--
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.580]   and a lot of times, the people that you pick--
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.940]   this isn't a very technical job doing the slate.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.700]   And a lot of times, the people you pick are people
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.020]   with good handwriting.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.420]   It's like, we don't know how good they are,
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:05.100]   but we can read whatever they wrote on here in a rush.
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.100]   And so--
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.700]   and I think that this is the first step.
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.420]   I mean, I think that the next step of this
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.100]   is being able to drive this data from a remote location,
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.900]   having this intersecting with the script supervisor that's
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.220]   sitting in the back, able to just have the slate.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.500]   No one has to write anything on the slate.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.460]   Right now you do.
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.700]   But I think that where I think this could be going
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:30.340]   is something like that in a more integrated pipeline.
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.020]   But with that little handle that you were just showing,
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.740]   with the little case, it would be perfect.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.780]   Because you could sit there and just hold it out,
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.660]   right in front.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.100]   Now you can also, of course, you can hit--
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:44.460]   there's the-- and which is kind of a cool little thing
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:45.620]   for the actual slate.
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.500]   Now what I really wish someone would build
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.100]   is a little case for this, that you could actually--
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:54.020]   you know, that you could actually have the physical slate
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:57.540]   and simply have all this kind of connect into it
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.660]   and become part of that.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.860]   Because there are things that you still
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:01.260]   want to be able to do with it.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.940]   But it's not the cheapest app.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.060]   It's $20.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:08.820]   There is a $50 in app purchase that really
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.020]   makes this thing pretty sick, which
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.180]   is that it--
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:14.220]   through the headphone jack, you can actually
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.540]   tap Jam Sync to a world time code generator.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.620]   So I know for some people who watch it,
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.060]   you don't know what a world time code generator is.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.540]   But being able to Jam Sync, your iPad to one is--
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.020]   yeah, it's cool.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:32.140]   So anyway, that's all I have to say from a geek perspective.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.660]   It's a pretty select piece.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.780]   If you were thinking of a smart slate, most of us
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.500]   don't need--
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:39.940]   most of us, this is all you would need.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:43.940]   And for $70, we pay $50 every time we rent a Denikys slate.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.300]   So the idea for $70 is being able to just have one that
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.140]   doesn't catch fire, like the two of the ones that we've had.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:54.380]   I don't know why, but they started smoking.
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:58.260]   And made us a little scared.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.900]   And I think for a lot of people, that's
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.460]   not going to be something that is fine to do whatever you're
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.060]   doing now.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.300]   But if you're really doing this stuff,
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.260]   and you need a smart slate, and you want something that
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.220]   isn't going to cost $1,400, and you already have an iPad,
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.620]   it's called Movie Slate.
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.580]   And with Andy's little handle there,
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.340]   the two of them paired together-- look at that.
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.380]   See, we hanging on to it.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.860]   That is like the perfect look at this.
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:21.780]   Look at this.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.460]   Speed.
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:23.700]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.740]   I think it's the perfect little--
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.220]   perfect pairing of these two things.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:28.940]   And it's Movie Slate.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.420]   And as I said, it's really, really a great little application.
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:35.060]   And I highly suggest it.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.460]   My other-- go ahead.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.220]   What are you saying, Andy?
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.460]   I just want to say that's actually a very, very useful thing.
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.540]   Even if you're not a professional producer,
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.020]   I have a similar little app.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.900]   I'm not sure if it's made by the same ones, same guys.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.940]   Same-- I think it's the same--
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.340]   I think it's the same-- the same program.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.340]   I thought so.
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:51.580]   And it's actually very, very useful,
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:54.580]   because I don't have the ability to have time code,
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:56.340]   or it's not even worth it for me to have time code.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:02.260]   But I might have my nice consumer-grade HD cam
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:03.740]   core that costs $500.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.860]   But I also have a little movie camera on my phone,
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.940]   or I might have a little flip video camera.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.220]   And if, when you get into Final Cut,
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.820]   it's very, very easy to do like a master shot,
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.140]   and then a two shot at the same time.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:18.540]   If you just point them both at this, do this.
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.700]   And-- oop.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.100]   There you go, right.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.460]   And then simply, when you're in Final Cut simply,
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.140]   make sure that they're all synced to that beep,
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:26.900]   and that's in that one frame.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:30.180]   Then for the entire rest of that shoot, it's not professional,
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:32.380]   but you will have all your video and all your sounds synced up.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.620]   So if you want to go to--
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.220]   gee, actually, something really--
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:38.700]   after the kid hit the ball, I want to go to the master shot,
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.380]   so I can see the play on the field.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.180]   You're no longer trying to say, OK, where was that?
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.260]   Wait a minute, was there a shout that I could sort of sync on,
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:45.660]   because all your cameras are synced up.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:47.860]   It was a very cheap way to get really, really slick effects
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.180]   with very, very cheap hardware.
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:51.780]   And the two other solutions for that, as people who are listening
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:55.620]   to listening, is that there is a--
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.660]   number one is that when you have that smart slate,
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:59.140]   so you see that timecode going?
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:01.620]   If all the cameras are seeing that timecode going by,
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:03.020]   you can go into Final Cut, and there's
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.740]   this secret little thing in Final Cut
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:06.660]   where you can do modify timecode.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:09.340]   And you can actually type the timecode in
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:10.500]   that you're seeing on the slate.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:13.460]   And you don't even have to find the same timecode to do that.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.020]   You simply can find any timecode, and you type it in,
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:18.100]   and it syncs all the tracks.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.300]   So that smart slate that you don't even need the beep,
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:21.620]   because you can just go in and just say,
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:24.100]   just find a frame where you see the smart slate.
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.940]   Type that in, and it will then replace the timecode that
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:31.500]   was in that clip with a new timecode that then creates--
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.540]   and if you do that with each angle,
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:37.380]   all of those will have the right timecode from then on.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.860]   The other solution, which I'll just make another pick
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.700]   right now since we're talking about all this,
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:44.540]   is a plug-in for Final Cut called Pluralize.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:49.180]   So Pluralize is literally when I showed it to one of our editors
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:52.980]   in the office, there were tears in his eyes.
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:57.020]   And I am not exaggerating.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:00.700]   I gave it to him for two days, and he was like--
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:01.460]   I said, how was it?
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:04.020]   And he was just like, oh my gosh.
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:07.500]   It was just-- because we sync, we do multicam constantly.
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:12.260]   And what Pluralize does is it just examines your whole--
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:15.780]   Pluralize examines all the audio in each track
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.020]   and just automatically syncs them.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.460]   So you just set them all into the thing.
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:20.940]   You add the plug-in, and you say, you just hit sync,
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.420]   and it just goes, and they're all done.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.140]   And there's no thinking about it.
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.180]   There's no whatever.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:27.020]   And it can do it.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:32.620]   You can have a cell phone, a professional, and a camcorder,
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.020]   and you know, together, just looking at the sound,
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:36.500]   and just going, well, I can just sync this all together.
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.860]   And so Pluralize is the thing that for us,
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:42.980]   if you want to spend $150, I think it's about $150.
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:49.500]   If you're doing multicam, if you're doing the basic--
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.740]   I just want to grab some stuff and do it in Final Cut
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:54.740]   or Final Cut Express.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:56.940]   The beep is you have to have something that's
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.620]   both sound and visual.
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.820]   And then if you're-- I don't know if Final Cut Express will
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:01.980]   let you modify time code.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:03.580]   So if you're doing Final Cut Express,
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.420]   being able to have the beep would do it.
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.460]   If you're in Final Cut, being able to type those things in.
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.060]   Anyway, this is a-- the only reason I kind of went down
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:16.780]   this path is this is an area that is very painful for us,
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:19.180]   or it has been for the last five or six years.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:23.580]   And we've slowly watched these solutions grow.
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.740]   And we kind of pay attention to each one,
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:27.980]   because we deal with it on a daily basis.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:33.620]   And that concludes this episode of This Week in Symphony.
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.660]   Well, we didn't-- I could explain how it's empty.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:36.340]   No, no, no, no.
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.340]   No, no, please don't.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.100]   No, no, no, no.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.940]   Anyway, so a little geek fest for those of you,
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.220]   right at the end of the show.
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:44.780]   We didn't want to scare you off at the beginning of the show
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:47.900]   with that, but hopefully you enjoyed that.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:52.340]   And for those of you using Final Cut, it's a cool thing.
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:54.380]   And once again, it's from singular software
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.940]   is where pluralized comes from.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:57.580]   If you're doing multicam editing, or you
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.180]   want to do multicam editing, and you're going to do it,
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.940]   and you've really just part with $149,
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:05.380]   it is worth every penny.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.780]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.820]   And Chris, where can people find you?
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:14.740]   People can always find me at macworld.com.
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:15.340]   And Andy--
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.340]   And that's there.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.900]   Where can people find you?
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:20.860]   If you can spell my last name, go to not go.com.
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:22.100]   If you can't spell my last name,
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.580]   but you have a good year for four letter acronyms,
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.580]   go to cwob.com, the celestial waste of bandwidth,
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.020]   and that will redirect you to where you want to go.
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:35.020]   And until next week, this break time is over.
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:36.100]   Get back to work.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:39.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:42.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:41:01.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
