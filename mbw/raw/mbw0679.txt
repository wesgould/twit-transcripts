[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.920]   This could be an eight hour show.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.120]   There is a lot, a lot to talk about.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   Andy and Akko and I were here last week talking about the new iPhones.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.520]   It's great to see you, Andy.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560]   Great to be here once again.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280]   Appreciate your patience in the library there.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.200]   That's OK.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.880]   It's quiet.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.680]   It's peaceful.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.080]   I hope you brought something to read.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.680]   No, I prefer to drop off a few things, sort of elevate the taste of the community.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.920]   I saw somewhere the St. Louis Public Library.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.720]   I think what St. Louis is eliminating late fees.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.480]   And I thought, that's not going to work.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.800]   That's a bad idea.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   Bad idea.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.120]   Also, Laurie Gill, she's here from iMore.com managing editor.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.360]   Hello, Laurie.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.480]   Hi.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.560]   You're wearing your your Apple Festivity hairdo today.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.000]   Yes, thank you.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.520]   Actually, Apple Festivity would probably make it lavender or mint green or six
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.040]   call rainbow rainbow.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.040]   Hey, that's Renee Richie, who is absolutely exhausted because he has filed.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.160]   And even the video is now encoding.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   I'm mostly filed.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.480]   So you got an iPhone at the event, I guess, because you've had it for a week.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   Got a couple.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.640]   Which ones did you get?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   That is.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.600]   I'll hold them up.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.280]   Can you see them?
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.520]   Oh, my God, a couple.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:07.800]   It looks like an iPhone 11 in lavender and an iPhone Pro 11 and a Pro 11 Pro Max
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   in khaki or tactical green green green.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.040]   Yeah, not green.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.320]   All right.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.960]   All right.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.200]   And I see pictures of Georgia Dow and her flaming red hair and the flaming sunset.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   So Georgia, Georgia lied to us when she said, I don't know if Renee has an iPhone.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   I don't know.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.800]   Of course I knew she was.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.240]   She.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.720]   Yeah, she.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.480]   What was it?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   This box that she implied?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.760]   She said, I don't know what Renee is doing.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.400]   Well, Renee, it turns out was up late.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.200]   Uh, so what do you think?
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.960]   Oh, actually, Laurie, did you get in or did you?
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.560]   Did you?
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.400]   I did.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.800]   So you I did get to go.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.160]   So you're you're you're
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.200]   your ploy of sitting outside looking mournful worked.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.560]   It did.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.440]   Somebody felt bad for me and actually invited me to the event.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.600]   Like an Apple employee come out and say, I'm sorry.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.440]   Here's a muffin.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.720]   It was the it was the patchouli.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.920]   Well, I'm telling you, it actually worked.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.560]   So you're both you were both there.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.080]   Awesome.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.040]   So kind of I have so many questions.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.800]   Of course, I have already ordered the 11 Pro Max.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.240]   So say nothing bad about it.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.240]   Nice.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.920]   It's so good.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.120]   There's nothing bad to say is there.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.960]   No, I mean, like it depends on how nitpicky you want to be about pro.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.680]   Like should pro be like an iPad where it has USB C and a pencil and, you know, a
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   couple of other things.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.440]   You can make an argument for that.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.120]   Absolutely.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.760]   But the stuff that it does have, it does very, very well.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.520]   Yeah, pro and we talked about this last week really is meaningless.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.720]   When it comes to a phone, it's like a Mac Pro.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.960]   It's a little less meaningful with an iPad, but it's totally.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.760]   No, I had a trio pro 10 years ago.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   It was fine.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.520]   So pro for Apple means the more expensive one.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.440]   It's not even, I mean, the 11 Pro is actually smaller than the 11, right?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.520]   It's not even the biggest one.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.880]   Yes.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.600]   And it's, but yeah, but they've got super battery life now, Leo.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.280]   So they're not feeling bad about themselves anymore.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.360]   That actually is question one from my point of view.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.880]   Apple claims five hour battery, better battery life on the iPhone 11 Flowmax.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.440]   Is that the case?
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.840]   So my usual testing is Pokemon Go Community Day because that's, you know, four or five
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.520]   hours of GPS and data and screen on.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.520]   And just basically everything you can think of the screen is rendering the GPU.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.880]   The CPU are all busy and we went like four hours and an hour after that.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.400]   And then I was photographing and filming and I hit the red around midnight, which has
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.240]   never happened before.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.320]   I'm going to show the battery case before.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   Holy cow.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.440]   And they're brand new.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.560]   Like these are brand new batteries.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.640]   So they're going to go as long as Apple says they're going to go.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   So I'm going to see how they do, you know, three months later, six months later, but
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.840]   there it's the OLED display is 15% more efficient.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.240]   And the A13 SOC is between, you know, 15 and 40% more efficient.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.800]   When you put those two things together with a slightly larger battery, miracles,
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.600]   our home.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.840]   Well, and iOS 13, we're already hearing people with older phones on iOS 13 getting better
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.360]   battery life.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.160]   So Apple's optimized in every possible corner.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.600]   Um, uh, that's, that's pretty good.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.440]   In fact, I know it's not tied to the departure of Johnny Ive, but to see Apple
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   make a slightly thicker phone with better battery.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   A little heavier.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.640]   I think people will live very nicely with extra battery.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.760]   Nobody's nobody's saying slimmer, slimmer.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.160]   It's something they do like they did that with the six S because they started
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.640]   putting the gasketing and the ceiling for water resistance.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.680]   Then they did it with the seven because that was officially water resistant.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.200]   And now these are the most water resistant iPhones ever.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.760]   And they also have a bunch of other stuff in them.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.360]   So they do go up a little bit, but then they tend to see to go back down.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.600]   So I'm just hoping they stick with it and just keep filling it with battery
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.680]   as though we're frosting.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.600]   We're going to be spoiled.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.680]   Just keep pumping it in there.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.920]   We're going to be totally spoiled.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   My question is, will people on YouTube still be able to bend them?
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.600]   I mean, uh, they'll break.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.120]   And I'm sorry.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.280]   I mean, it was bad.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.560]   But you can break and bend anything given enough torque.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   But, but can they still blame Apple?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.200]   But can you blame Apple?
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.840]   Exactly.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.600]   I've been very impressed with the night shots.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.000]   Uh, yeah, as you were talking, I think it was before the show started about how
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.640]   you found yourself talking to Rufin at midnight.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.760]   I tweeted that like I wasn't even expecting anything.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.920]   I just wanted to take a shot.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.800]   I turned the flash off so I couldn't fire.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   And then I took one with the 10 R and one with the 11.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.600]   And you could see everything.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.680]   It was like the interesting thing is I was looking, we were doing some comparisons
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.880]   between the different night modes, the Google night mode, Huawei, Samsungs, apples,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.640]   and they all make very different choices.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.400]   Like some of them reduce color to try to enhance clarity.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.640]   And some of them just, you know, they don't really resolve texture too much.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.080]   They try to focus on people more.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   And Apple is trying to get as much color as they can, but also detail in different
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.640]   textures.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.880]   So like wood looks different than cloth, then looks different than skin.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.160]   And it's it's very, it's almost an artistic, uh, dark night mode.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.680]   And they don't want it to look like day.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.440]   Like some companies just want to turn night into day, but they want, they make
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.400]   the light fall off pretty quick if they can find a subject in it.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.480]   So it's still kind of moody and has a lot of ambiance.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.280]   So yeah, this is the, the, the AI feature.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.400]   This is a, by the way, this is a 10 R picture from the roof.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.160]   And this is the same picture with the 10 or 11 max.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.640]   Piss the 11.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.600]   That's not even 11.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   Just 11, not even a three, not even the three lens version.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.640]   No.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.560]   Um, so, uh, side by side, uh, you can really.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.800]   Only with the basic with the, with the, with the regular camera, because that has
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.040]   100% focus pixels and it's using those to suck in as much light as it can before
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.920]   it does everything else.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.640]   So what, what I've, when I understand, and you got brief, so correct me, but, uh,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.400]   the minute you open the camera app, it starts taking pictures.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.160]   It starts understanding the picture using machine learning.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.440]   Yes.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.040]   And that's a face.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.720]   That's a brick.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.960]   That's, uh, sky.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.760]   And, uh, it also does an interesting thing that Google does not do much of this
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.160]   is similar to what the pixel three did, but it takes a overexposed picture, an
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   extra bright picture, throws that in the mix, then takes your picture and that's,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.600]   you said that picture is with the one lens.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.320]   You don't have to say night mode.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.840]   That's another thing with the Google pixel.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.320]   You have to put it in night mode.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.560]   This is, this just does it.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.400]   What happens is there's this little icon next to the flash that turns yellow when
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.880]   like gets dark enough and it'll say one second and then it gets darker.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.760]   It'll say two seconds gets even darker.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.960]   It'll say three seconds.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.160]   And then when you take the picture, you see a little, um, little
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.840]   tackline across the bottom sort of fly across showing you how long you should
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.320]   hold the picture still for.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.880]   And then once you have it, it sort of gets brighter and brighter in the view
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.240]   finder.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   So I say entertain you so you don't move too much while you're taking it.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.200]   And then the picture will come up and it takes about as long to save as the
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.600]   iPhone seven did a portrait mode.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.400]   So it takes like, you know, a second to save depending on how complicated
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.000]   everything is.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.800]   And then you just, you have the picture and I think it's pulling information off
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.600]   the live preview.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.360]   One of my favorite things about apples, phones that they've always tried to
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.440]   make the live preview, like they fuse anything they need to make that live
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.320]   preview realistic.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.000]   And so that that's three second thing is pulling all the data out of the
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.280]   preview image that they're getting.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.920]   So they can figure out, okay, this is a human face.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.080]   I've got to make sure the color is right.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.120]   It's got to look like skin.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.320]   There's no face in this.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.400]   I don't have to worry so much.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.440]   This is a light and does all that stuff.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.560]   Like you said before, pre crunches everything so that you can get that picture
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.360]   when you tap it and doesn't have to do it after you've taken the shot.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   It's also doing the portrait again and boy, these portraits of Georgia are
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.200]   gorgeous and I really think this is kind of neat.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.720]   This is these are HDR is the HDR actually apples calling it XDR, aren't they?
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.640]   Or the display is XDR the smart HDR for the photos XDR for the display.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.000]   Okay.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And that's really more just to call back to the Mac Pro display, the XDR
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.160]   display than anything else.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.440]   It would be the peak brightness and sustained brightness levels.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.960]   So these are smart HDR shots.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.360]   Again, you don't have to tell it to.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   It just does it in the past.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.440]   Apple and other phones have maybe taken HDR too far, sometimes over sharpening
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.720]   or over softening, but these look pretty darn.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.440]   We're like Austin Mann exposing silhouettes when you actually want to
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.520]   see as an artist.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.920]   These these really are just great.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.040]   That's a beautiful picture.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.480]   Yes, the sun behind her, which is what we're trying to do to see like
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.760]   she was all the way it was basically behind her at that point.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.160]   So that's historically something that iPhone has not done well is backlight,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   a photography.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.640]   In fact, a Neelite Patel has a series of shots that he shows the 10 are not
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.840]   handling backlight at well at all in the 11 doing much better.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.960]   This looks great.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   And again, like if it gets even too, if it gets too dark for the night mode,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.880]   it'll just switch to flash.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.560]   You have the flash enabled though.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's it's sort of smart like that.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.480]   And if you, if you have a tripod or you can hold it on a surface,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.800]   like you put it up on a surface, it'll do the night mode for up to 28 seconds.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.840]   So they were showing some pictures that look like you pulled every star out of
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.680]   the night sky.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.560]   Wow.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.000]   Wow.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.800]   All right.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:10.120]   And now thanks to snapchat, you can do 3D selfies.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.560]   I don't know.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.000]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.200]   Micah Sarger was showing me in snapchat.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.160]   And actually you don't even need the new phones.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.480]   You could do it with the older fun too.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   You can 3D selfies, which are kind of creepy weird.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.480]   The only big difference with the pro now is because when you do portrait mode,
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.800]   you use the wider lens to get the depth data.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.360]   You now have two portrait modes because you can shoot telephoto with a wide
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.400]   angle depth data or wide angle with the ultra wide angle depth data.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.320]   So you get both the close up and the mid range portrait mode, which is nice.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.680]   Apple started with the iPhone 11, not the 11 pro.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.360]   I mentioned that the 10R last year was its best selling iPhone.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   You think now that you have both, do you think most people should get an 11?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.840]   Not a pro.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.760]   Yeah, I mean, first, I just got to say that, you know, the Wall Street Journal
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   called the iPhone 10R beleaguered in a failure, I think 18 times successively.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.920]   And where were they wrong?
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.040]   Didn't give up on them.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.160]   So just walk off into the yard and die.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.320]   Yeah, no, and I think a couple of people have said it was the best.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.600]   I was IDC, but a couple analysts said it was the best selling phone in the world.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.120]   You know, single single phone, not conglomeration of phones, which is neat.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.960]   Well, but yeah, that was battery life.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.280]   Clearly sending two signals to Apple price and battery life are important to consumers.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.600]   And Apple responded this year.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.280]   And a little fun, a little bit of humor, if he wins a little bit of whimsy.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.200]   Every once in a while.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.120]   But yeah, everyone should get the 11.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.440]   It's it's and I'm not just saying like if you care desperately about like about Oled
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.160]   because that OLED display is really, really nice.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.280]   It's using Samsung's latest process, same one that's used on the Galaxy S10
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.200]   and it Apple's doing their own thing with it.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   So it's like it's not exactly the same, but it's it's using that process.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.400]   Apple's materials and their mitigations and stuff, but it looks really, really great.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.360]   And if you really want to telephoto camera, those are the big differences.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.840]   There are some small differences like the waterproofing is better.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.760]   You might like the textured surface better.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.560]   You might really want for by form MIMO aggregated LTE if you even know what that is.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.800]   So there's like three or four things that if you're a nerdy nerd about any or multiple
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.480]   of those things, you're going to want the pro.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.600]   But I think the vast majority of people won't even notice that those things aren't there.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.080]   And it starts at 699 is 64 gigs too.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.960]   Too small.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.240]   Should you up the storage?
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.280]   I would prime for two reasons.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.640]   One is I'm at 69 gigs.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   So I would have to, but also it's just 50 bucks.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.000]   Like Apple traditionally is a hundred bucks.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.440]   It's just 50 bucks to go to 128.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.800]   And that's pretty good.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.400]   It's not the best deal in the world, but it's a really good Apple deal.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.480]   And 128 is probably enough for most people.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:39.640]   Right.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.440]   Let me let me be a different voice on that one, though.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.280]   I have about 35.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.440]   I've used about 35 gigs on my phone.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.040]   And it's my daily driver.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.400]   It's not like an extra phone.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.440]   It's the one I use all the time.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.520]   So not everybody is going to be using that much storage.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.760]   So I'm thinking a lot of real techie people who do a lot of really techie type stuff.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.960]   They're going to they're going to ramp it up.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.760]   But if you put a lot of stuff in the cloud, like I don't I don't I don't I don't put music on my phone
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.880]   because I can stream it.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   I don't put movies on my phone because I can stream it.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.040]   So if you're doing a lot of stuff in the cloud, you don't actually need 128.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.200]   But Renee is right.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.840]   It's only $50 more if you wanted to go for it.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.920]   Oh, the other thing is you might be using the camera more.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.440]   You might be shooting a lot more video.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.320]   Both of these are spectacularly good.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.880]   That's the kind of thing that fills up a phone fast, although you can offload it.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.800]   Now that now that 60 frame per second, 4k is available and different in more modes.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:39.000]   Also now that now that you have a much better display with the spatial audio, you might find yourself thinking,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.960]   well, I may as well download stuff from Netflix Netflix and keep it on my phone.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.400]   Instead of watching stuff on my laptop, the thing about the storage that you can't add it later.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   So yeah, for 50 bucks, particularly with a phone that I think is designed that you will just find yourself and
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.160]   mercy yourself in this up to the neck.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:03.000]   As soon as you start getting it, this is you have to factor in how much how much are you going to love this phone?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.040]   How much are you going to hate not having whatever experience you want to have having it in this phone as opposed to switching to your tablet,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.800]   your iPad, your laptop, whatever.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And from everything I've been I've been I've had a much more regular sleep schedule, absolutely than Renee.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.880]   But mostly it's like it's like finding out that like someone's so some engineer has responded to an email like at 2 30 AM.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:36.080]   And I know that if I if I reply right away and get them on chat, I can actually fire questions before like he has to go to work and I have to go to bed.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.840]   And every single thing I'm seeing about this phone really does say that this is a phone that you are there's no there's no
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:51.680]   there's very, very little reason to get off the sofa, go go go go go go across, find your find your laptop charger and bring your laptop to you.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:59.360]   It's going to be such a such a great experience using this device for a hundred different reasons that yeah, I'd be side say 50 bucks.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.640]   I won't I won't loan you the 50 bucks, but I'm going to encourage you to spend the 50 bucks.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.400]   Not not my 50 bucks, but somebody's 50 bucks.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.680]   And I think it's like two dollars on the installment plan difference or one one or two dollars on the installment plan difference.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.240]   Speaking of chargers, much better charger in the box now.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.760]   Finally for the pro.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.120]   Only the pro.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.600]   Okay.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.320]   Yeah, the pro gets the USB C 18 watch charger and the 11 gets the usual lightning.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.040]   That's nice though.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.760]   I want lightning.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:33.520]   And I noted that you and others on Twitter are still bemoaning the off center lightning.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's the there's a they put they basically who cares.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.680]   What are these people that care about that?
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:48.480]   Industrial design geeks leo we care about everything every hole every notch every every bit of construction.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.040]   I guess so.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.240]   Renee would it be would you be?
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:18:02.400]   Will you and your like be made more happy if let's say that we sold like a special sort of case where the phone is offset inside the case to make it look like.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.320]   You've got the you've got the.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.360]   I'm sorry Andrew.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.160]   That's a clue.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.440]   I don't want to.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.560]   A little bit of you know.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:19.040]   Because people like Apple people were always making fun of Samsung for never being able to align their ports like at all different ports.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.640]   Like someone took them and threw them on the phone at some point and now they can't even do it.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.840]   It's like you know, it's just a little bit.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.280]   Yeah, well, that's that's that's why like maybe we shouldn't have been making fun of Samsung for doing that.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.360]   It's like I mean, it's it's it's nice.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.040]   It's details do matter and if it and I.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.760]   You're always correct whenever you say this is how this thing makes me feel.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.680]   But there's a difference between.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.360]   I'm what the thing that makes me roll my eyes is when it goes from.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.640]   Oh, well, gosh, she does look a little bit weird with it offset like that to fail losers.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.040]   This is why Samsung just doesn't get it.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.320]   It's like, dude, dude, we have.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.800]   We there's an there's an ASIC that had to go there.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.840]   And so we were kind of like, okay with moving.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.960]   What if you just planned the ASIC last fall like I told you to.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:12.480]   I know I bet I bet during the I fixed here down they didn't even paint the inside of the case as well as they painted the outside.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.480]   Oh, shocking, shocking.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.520]   Can never use it again, Andy.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:15.920]   Thank you.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.240]   Speakers better.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.000]   So there's two there's two things that they can do.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.760]   One is if you have Dolby 5.1 Apple has their own custom virtualizer that will do spatial placement for the sound.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.680]   Come on. It's just a small little speaker in the bottom of the phone.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.400]   You can't tell me.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.480]   Yeah, you say that, but then I was watching.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.840]   So I'm the kind of person who's been using my cell phone speaker forever.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.120]   Like I used to listen to Mac break weekly on the speaker of my Trio 6.8.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.080]   We do not encourage that.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:53.040]   I don't encourage putting it to your ear when you're in a cafe and yelling at a person on FaceTime on your ear.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.440]   But like if you're on your own, like the privacy of your own home, you can listen on a speaker if you want to.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.760]   But this will place it. So like I was watching Godzilla and I was watching Bumblebee and you hear like moving
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:10.000]   around. And if it has Dolby at most encoding, it'll just use the at most encoding and just make a sound state.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.720]   And the thing that's really cool about this is Apple built this world class audio lab.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.960]   And I remember they took us there for the home pod and I was in the analyst track for that.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.640]   So I was with a bunch of like all the analysts that you know, basically, and they're like,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.080]   we've never been in one this big.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.920]   This is like five times the size of any of any quiet room we've ever
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.520]   been in. And this is like, oh, we can see down eight floors. Wow.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.440]   And they were like super impressed. But I think Apple's doing things in there like the air pods,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.000]   like the home pod. Like they're now doing this virtual thing where it tries to detect where the earpiece is on your ear and project the sound
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.040]   in the right direction for you. And all of that is paying off now across like every product they're making.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.960]   And that's when you have these, this many billions of dollars and you can make a building like that.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.480]   You start to earn dividends from it.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   Renee, though they're not promoting it like this. Would you say the new spatial speakers are kind of are more like true stereo?
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.880]   Like there's left and right channels or at least like maybe a computational version of left and right channels.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.880]   Yeah, it's like a sound stage. It's like the previous ones had wide stereo,
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.440]   which was very much like that you'd hear like the right and the left.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.120]   And here it's like it's it's all the way right is halfway right.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.840]   It's a quarter of the way right. It's center. It's a quarter left half left full left.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.560]   That's kind of amazing. Yeah, I have to say, and we're going to talk about Apple Arcade in a little bit,
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.760]   but the games on Apple Arcade all have really spectacular sound and playing the one the iPad Pro.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.560]   You really noticed that Apple's put a lot of detail, a lot of attention to audio playback.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.840]   And the developers are so proud. We had a chance to chat with them too. And they're like,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.400]   we want to make the Mac version amazing and the Apple TV version amazing because usually we don't
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.640]   have time or money to bother with those. Nice. Nice. Well, we'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.560]   I want to take advantage of the fact that you didn't get a phone, right? Lori, I'm just...
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   I did not. I don't mean to. I don't mean to. Yeah, I don't mean to focus on Renee,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.080]   but he's the one who has the phone. He's the one who's holding them in his eyes.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.040]   If we were closer, we would be sure. Yes. And I presume you didn't get a
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.320]   watch, a series five watch yet. You still just have the phone or do you have a watch too?
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.520]   I'm not wearing anything today. Me or Renee? I do not.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.080]   Okay. And Renee's not wearing it today. Sorry. Yeah, exactly. Sorry.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.760]   Okay. Got it. Got it. And Renee, where I goes not off, I understand.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.560]   Renee, I'm having a laugh at your expense, but I am also the person who snuck like a
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.920]   pre-release phone into the studio. I remember that. Hidden inside a case for an older phone.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.160]   So we are just... I learned from watching Andy. Andy's very good.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.800]   I would ask him and he would be like, what is that over there? Is that a bird?
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.240]   Is my is my sensei, my yoda? I don't want to belabor. I did order...
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.560]   I can tell you I did get to look at them. Oh, yeah.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.960]   If you have some questions on what that titanium looks like.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.480]   I ordered the titanium. I'm thinking I'm nuts. I ordered the dark titanium with a link band.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.640]   I hope that was a good idea. It was a lot of money. So it better be a good idea.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:10.960]   Titanium is absolutely gorgeous. I love this color. In terms of the difference in brushed metal,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.360]   it's definitely the winner, in my opinion, over aluminum.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.520]   And then when you're getting into that comparison between the polished
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.200]   metal of stainless steel versus the brushed metal of titanium,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.680]   it's a little more complicated as to what you like better. But I absolutely love
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.280]   the way that titanium looks. It's deep and rich. So it really feels like real jewelry when you
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:39.360]   look at it. It's gorgeous. And I think I prefer... I don't usually want... I don't prefer the black
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:45.520]   case, but in terms of between the two titanium colors, I prefer the black just because it has
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.480]   this nice shine to it, even though it's brushed. So it's really, really gorgeous. You're going to
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.640]   love it. I got the right one. Thank God. I got the same one. Did you get that too?
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.560]   I ordered it. Yep. A little pricey, but I thought, well, in fact, last year I ordered just the cheapest
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.080]   one I could get. But I thought, "Oh, I kind of like... I've had titanium watches." I always say that.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.280]   I'm like, "I'm never going to buy more than the aluminum again." And then every year it's like,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:15.840]   "Oh, we have a new new material for you." Right. So I got the... This black titanium with the
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.040]   space black link. You think that's a good choice? That's what you got, Renee? Yeah, except I didn't
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.520]   get it with the space black link because I already had that my first... You had one.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.840]   ...first. Apple watch was the black steel that came with that. So I got it with one of the new
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.680]   two-tone bands, which I really like. This will be my first link because I've always resisted it
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.400]   because it's like ridiculously expensive. It's hundreds of dollars for a watch band.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.360]   The funny thing about it though is other watchmakers had those for 100 years and
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.280]   I never thought to make them easy. And now they all do it. Apple makes it once and now the entire
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.160]   world is waiting for a link. Easy to take or add a link so that it fits just right.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.360]   This doesn't have a magnet in it though because I noticed that they said, "If you want the compass
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:59.200]   to work in the watch, don't use a magnetic wrist bracelet." There's no magnet in the linker is there.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.880]   No, no, not that I need a compass. But you know what? You say that.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.800]   Oh, but let's talk about the compass. I'm very excited. Why? Are you an
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.880]   oriented to get lost on stage? I get lost in the woods actually.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:23.440]   Do you? It's fantastic to me that they've been able to fit an actual magnetometer.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.000]   I cannot say that magnetometer. Magneto meter. You say it magnetometer.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.360]   This named after the X-man magneto. Magneto.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:38.160]   Into that tiny little Apple watch and it's not digital or it's not based on...
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.360]   That's what surprised me. It's not GPS. It's a magnetic compass.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.760]   Yes. And that's all right there on your wrist. It's crazy.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.240]   Really impressive. Oh, Laurie's saying to me about this because I didn't think it was a big
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   deal. And then she said it was a really big deal. So I started asking around. And the first thing
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.720]   people told me was you're out with your family, but you've gotten separated and you just say,
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.880]   find my wife, find my kid. And then without even touching your phone, it shows you exactly which
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:12.480]   direction to go as well. Well, that also brings up this U1 chip, which Apple mentioned briefly.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.600]   Did they brief you on Ultra Wideband? Did they talk about that at all?
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.520]   They did not very much because the first feature using it, which is going to be a spatial
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.920]   air drop, is not shipping until 13.1. So they just said, this is what it does and this is what's
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.360]   coming. I want to take a little break because Jason Stel did do an article about it. I'm very
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:37.600]   curious about it, but we got to take a break. This is of course our first chance to talk to a man
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:44.640]   who's been holding the iPhone for a week. And I'm shocked to say dunked it in the water.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.760]   Did you hear from Apple about that one? It was floating.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.080]   You got a claims test, right? Like you can't, everything they said, I'm sure they're very good
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.880]   company. I've used a lot of testing, but I have to do it too. Wow. Is there a reason the flashlight's
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.920]   on? Is that so you can find it if it floats away? There's two reasons. One, I'm in a flood zone
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.120]   and there's really strong currents here. Two, it shows me that the phone is still working because
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.000]   I think it'll go off if anything goes wrong. Good point. And it survived this dunking.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.680]   Yeah. I mean, the rating now is really good. The 11 is rated to two meters and the pro is
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.920]   rated to, sorry, two meters and the pro is rated to four meters, both for 30 minutes.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.520]   That's really good. I mean, I don't think we would recommend using it for underwater photography.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.240]   No, because water resistance degrades over, like the more you use it, the more it degrades,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.000]   especially if you use it in chlorine or salt water and don't rinse it off carefully. So
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.520]   you can have an nasty surprise one day. If you're going to, if you want to do underwater
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.000]   photography, just get one of those cases and it's super safe. But if it accidentally falls into
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.520]   the pool, you know, you're the deep end now you're fine. It's that's what it's designed for.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.640]   Emergencies not for regular use. Anyway, we'll take a break. We come back. I want to ask about
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:01.280]   the camera bump too. I have lots of questions and there is a there is a rant. Awesome. There is a
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.880]   rant. There's always a rant. There's always Renee stayed up late to rant. We've got to give him
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   the credit on that too. But before we do, let me mention fresh books, my favorite, my second
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.920]   favorite Canadian. Actually, we my third after Georgia, you and then fresh books, fresh books.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:25.360]   My fourth favorite Canadian after you, Georgia, Emma MacArthur. Well, I can go on. It's a very
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:31.120]   nice company up there in the beautiful Toronto area. I started using fresh books to do my invoicing
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.640]   back in 2004 when I was going to Canada to do a call for help up there. And I just hated the
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.360]   invoicing. I had to do the conversion of Canadian dollars and I get all my receipts together. It
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.080]   was just a pay in the butt. I did learn though, important lesson. If you don't invoice, you don't
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.960]   get paid. Amber told me about fresh books and man, it was a revolution. Fresh books takes the stress
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:59.360]   out of accounting for you, for your team. Easy to use invoices, billing, expense organization. Yeah,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.760]   you could even take pictures of expenses on the fresh books app, put them right in the invoice
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.240]   or store them away for later. Time tracking, yes. It takes all your client information and makes it
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.560]   available to you. Easy to update in the client hub. And then you can get it in the app. So you
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.240]   always have the information you need about any project, any client. You can look at expense reports,
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.120]   track time, create invoices, keep your clients up to date on your progress, share details with them.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   And it's all in one screen, no more toggling back and forth from app to app. You find everything
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.760]   you need in fresh books. I love the app. I love the website. You are going to love fresh books.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.160]   It lets you stay on top of your business as well, being you'll know at any given time. If you're
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:46.000]   making money, that's something most of us freelancers don't know till tax time. It's just fantastic.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.040]   They've got a great dashboard. They've got accurate timekeeping, no more calculators, no more
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.520]   spreadsheets, no more receipts. Your life gets easier as fresh books lets you take your business
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.640]   to the next level. Fresh books used and trusted by small business owners in over 120 countries
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.920]   handles all those currencies automatically. Their customer service from their folks up in
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.720]   Toronto is fantastic, the nicest people. You could phone them, email them, you can live chat them
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.440]   no matter what time. So they're always there for you, which is great. And if you are running a

[00:30:51.120 --> 00:31:05.360]   So in the invite, it's said by innovation only and a number of pundits Renee have said,
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:13.040]   "Where was the innovation here?" This is a TikTok-Tok phone. It's not the iPhone 10s. It's the
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:20.800]   iPhone 10s. They said to say, "I mean, so I took issue with this when the Galaxy Note
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.720]   came out and the Galaxy S10 because people were like, "I'm so bored with this now too." And I'm way
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.880]   too optimistic about technology to be bored by this kind of stuff. It's like we spent a decade
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.120]   making these things really, really good. And now we're starting to do a lot of fun things with them,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.480]   but oh, they're still rounded rectangles. So I'm going to be all super cynical about it and think
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.680]   that that makes me sound smart. And I just, ah, it's me nuts. You say innovation is making that
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.960]   extra camera truly useful. Part of a consistent, cohesive experience is the difference between a
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.440]   throwaway and a tool. Apple didn't make the first MP3 player. They made the iPod. Not the
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.880]   first smartphone, but the iPhone, not the first tablet or smartwatch or wireless earbuds and on
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.920]   and on. Apple's innovation today remains the same as it's always been in packaging technologies in
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.680]   a way that provides the best experience possible for mainstream customers. And that's what they're
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.800]   doing here with wide angle and of right. Yeah, like for example, we talked about it before.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.200]   It's like all of these companies like Google does this too. They work on very, very small,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.920]   very, very internal things that just makes your life better. So you like you lose less photographs.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.000]   You get the photograph you really want. The phone doesn't die. And there's all these things that
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.720]   they do that doesn't make the phone look like a triangle or a donut. But every day makes your
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.880]   life just a little bit less frustrating. And we turn around and go, "Oh, you're so boring."
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.400]   It's so peak. I have to agree with you. I have to actually after reading the reviews,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.800]   I do feel like there is some really big stuff in here. There is some significant progress.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:52.960]   Not enough. Even if you have an iPhone XS Max, probably. But certainly, if you have any older
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:59.360]   iPhone, right? I don't know. Five extra battery life. I know even that alone. Yeah.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.920]   There's the part of me that wants to say, "You know what? Your 10S is fine. It's doing great.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.120]   You don't need to upgrade this year." But there's that other part of me that goes five extra hours
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.440]   is huge. Yeah. And that's the kind of thing that doesn't sound like innovation. That sounds like,
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.880]   "Oh, yeah, it's incremental improvement." But to remember that they had to change the operating
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:30.480]   system, they had to change the processor. They had to change everything. The panel. To make this
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.400]   work. That's innovation. I think that qualifies. I put it put a bit
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.320]   Twitter poll because everybody was saying that they don't buy it. You don't need to upgrade.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.280]   So I put up a poll saying, "Are you going?" And they're like, "Yes, yes. I'm talking about
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.840]   other people shouldn't do it." And I think the people who buy the 10S, not that all of them are
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.600]   going to upgrade because some people certainly buy a new phone every four years. But there are
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.320]   just some people who are geeks who always want, they buy three phones a year. There are different
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.480]   rules for different people and how they choose to budget their money. And it's their business.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.160]   And I feel like we shouldn't text-shame them. Have you had a chance to play?
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.480]   Go ahead, Andy. There's also the iPhone.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.680]   Lori, hold on, Lori. Go ahead, Andy. Yeah. And also, this is a really great
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:16.000]   under-the-hood innovative upgrade. I'll say that they, I will only say that they kind of stuck
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.760]   their neck out by putting innovation right there on the invitation, which means that you are going
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.320]   okay. If you say that this is about innovation, we're going to start. We're going to get out the
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.080]   innovation test kit and really look at everything that you're doing here.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.800]   But that said, it's not, this isn't the sort of thing where you're, I think that you're going to
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:41.680]   feel as though you missed out by buying it this year instead of buying the iPhone 12 next year.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.440]   The fact that they are really first off the blocks with Wi-Fi 6, the fact that they are doing
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.760]   ultra-wide networking, that all these radios they put it underneath there that will not just
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:59.280]   give them great things to demo on launch day, but also a reason why they can say, oh, by the way,
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.120]   we're introducing this new feature that we couldn't have done if we didn't, if not for the fact that
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.920]   we had put this really cool new radio inside this handset, knowing that we're, no way we can make
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:15.120]   this deadline in September, but for January, for iOS 13.2, for 13.1, you're going to continue to get
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.760]   value out of this phone. So no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not disappointed with this phone at all.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.840]   This is not a, this is not even a talk prime. This is an excuse to kind of drop the tick-talk
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:32.640]   paradigm entirely. Yeah, that's a bad paradigm. There's so many services now that allow you to
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:40.400]   upgrade your phone every year, sort of a least to own plan. And I think that question of, should I
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.240]   upgrade this year becomes a little less important when, when you're on an iPhone upgrade program,
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.760]   or the AT&T next or whatever your services that you have, you can just trade it in for another one.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:58.400]   You're continuing to pay for a phone, but if you kind of think of it as I'm leasing to get to the
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.840]   next phone, then yeah, every year you should upgrade every single year. And in fact, this year,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.720]   if you were on the 10R last year and you upgrade to the 11 this year, you're saving money because
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   it's less expensive than last year's phone. So that's pretty awesome.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:20.320]   Yeah, good point. I bet it does sell a lot of the Apple iPhone forever plans.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.760]   Because people aren't going to want these upgrades, I think. Let's put it that way. It's a
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.040]   sufficient upgrade that it's something to make you lust for it, even if you decide to be fiscally
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:37.120]   prudent. Do you miss 3D Touch Renee or is the haptic touch good enough? I thought I was going to
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.160]   because I really like 3D Touch and I really use it and I know that I'm probably not the majority.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:48.400]   Yeah, yeah, I'm the only one. But so there's two things that I do like about it. One is that Apple
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:54.320]   never pushed 3D Touch out past the iPhone, which meant like all the cool home screen shortcuts
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.440]   that you could use. All of a sudden, if you could do it, you just couldn't do it on the iPad and
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:04.080]   then I would forget sometimes to do it. And also, it was very, there was a lot of collisions.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.360]   Like the difference in a long press and a deep press, it's easy for some people. It is really
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.000]   not easy for other people. That kind of a muscle coordination or just eye hand coordination. So
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   people were like, I just want to put this folder in jiggly mode and it won't do it. And I'm going to
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.120]   throw this phone if it did. It was really frustrating for some people. So what this does is it makes
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   it all the same all across iOS 13 devices. It works on your iPad. The only difference is you do get
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:35.520]   that haptic feedback on the iPhone and it feels about the same and it does almost everything that
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.400]   3D Touch used to do. The only things it doesn't do are the things that actually depended on real
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:47.760]   pressure data. So when you would hold the space bar, turn it into trackpad mode and then
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.640]   depress to alternate between text selection and cursor movement, you can't do that anymore.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.760]   You have to use the two fingers like the iPad and I find that harder on the iPhone screen.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.440]   And also, drawing apps could do pressure sensitivity on the iPhone. It was never great because again,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.480]   tiny screen, but they could do it. And that's gone now. So I demand a pencil in exchange.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.720]   No pencil. There was some hope that a pro meant pencil, but apparently.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.880]   Every year. Yeah, every year. I know you draw. To me, you know, I have
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.320]   it would be field notes, digital field notes, field notes, kind of the drop box would be so great.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   I have yet to unholster my pencil on my note 10 plus. So I doubt I really use it on an iPhone.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.520]   Missile launch rate. Let's see. What else? I want to make sure you gave it 4.5 out of 5.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:43.680]   Why not a five? So, I mean, I do think that there's things that, you know, could be better. Like,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.200]   I do think USB C, it's time for USB C on the iPhone, especially the iPhone Pro.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.280]   I would have liked that. I would have liked that. I would have loved that.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.720]   Not just because I want USB C. Lightning was great because it did everything USB C does now,
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.320]   most of the things at least. And it did it years before USB C was ready to ship.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.040]   So as an Apple user, I got the benefit of advanced technology two or three years before
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.840]   the consortium got their stuff together. But now it's together and it's still confusing. Like
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:17.760]   USB PD, thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0, 3.14. It's a huge mess, but I can take an SSD drive and plug it
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.840]   into my iPad Pro and just use it. And I can't do that to my iPhone Pro. And I feel like now
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.600]   it's starting to be lightning users who are losing out. And that to me is the point where you got
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.960]   to start flipping the switch. Half a star for that. Over that. And like, there's just a couple.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.760]   Go ahead, Laurie. If you're thinking about the iPhone 11 as the phone for everyone,
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.720]   and you're thinking about the iPhone 11 Pro as the phone for sort of the tech nerds,
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:51.600]   then, you know, that should be USB C. The iPhone 11 sticking with the lightning makes a lot of
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.640]   sense. Not everybody switched over to USB C yet. But people who want the Pro, they've probably got
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:02.880]   USB C in a lot of their things. So to not give them that pro level of connection, it seems like
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.560]   they really missed the mark on that. If they're trying to market it as a pro, you know,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   it just would have made my life easier. I wouldn't have to have different cables, different chargers,
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.680]   different, you know, setups. Yeah, because everything else I have a mess, but most people
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.320]   wouldn't. Well, but everything I have is and it everything charges charges is kind of like the
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:27.920]   lowest common denominator for C. So for me charging. And then I use a USB C Yuba key, and I still have
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:35.120]   to figure out how to do that. Your four and a half out of five is both for the iPhone 11 and
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.960]   the iPhone Pro. I should clarify, you do have. I very rarely do fives as well. So I'm always
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.640]   tenured up. Yeah, you got to save something for next time. It just feels like that's an ending.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:51.920]   Like it feels to me like five is an ending, not at the beginning. Yeah. You're great on a curve.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:59.440]   You don't want to have to get a swelled head. That's right. Very exciting. Now let's talk about
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:08.240]   3.0 and 3.1 because that's a little confusing. The phone as shipped will ship with 3.0. The
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.280]   public bait is already to 3.1. Yes. When will 3.1 follow?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.680]   September 30th. And the month. Yeah, I think that's what they said. So what are we missing?
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.160]   Actually, Neili Patel said something very strange in his verge review. He said,
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.360]   I would wait to buy the iPhone till 13. I said three. I meant 13.1 comes out.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:36.960]   There's a. There's a couple of things that are going to be missing. Like the shortcuts app
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:44.400]   doesn't have in 13.0 doesn't have some of the special automations that are going to be in 13.1.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.280]   I can't remember the details off the top of my head, but Renee, you might be able to help me.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:59.360]   Reminders is different in 13.1 versus 13.0. I believe for tablets and iPhones.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   Well, I had a Wes and Mac OS aren't shipping. So you have to be careful about what you decide to use
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:12.000]   is the tricky point, I think, for a lot of people. Yeah. So that's what it is. So 13.0, your phone
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.680]   is on 13.0. But if you have upgraded to the, if you're on the public beta of iPad OS, and you've
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.800]   been following the upgrade, it's already on 13.1, which doesn't drop until the 30th. The iPad OS
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   doesn't publicly drop at all until the 30th of September. That's a little weird. I don't really
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.560]   understand what happened there. This is the first time they've done,
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.840]   they've separated iOS for the iPad and the iPhone. So this is kind of new territory.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.920]   We've had operating system drop on different days before the Mac operating system doesn't
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:55.520]   always drop on the same day as iOS. And then there's TBS and Watch-o-Wach, which usually always come.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:02.240]   So if you took iPad out of the equation, you'd still be getting what does happen often,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.040]   which is iOS, Watch-o-Wach, and TBS dropping all on the same day. And then Mac OS coming out a
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.080]   little bit later. We just, now we have iPad OS in the equation, and that's kind of throwing us all
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.280]   off because we're not used to our iPads and iPhones not upgrading it on the exact same day. So
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.440]   this is what we're faced with. There's a lot of weird things about it that it's going to be new
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.800]   and different this year. We're going to have a lot of things to try to figure out. One of the
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:34.240]   biggest being that if you are on iOS, if the public beta of iOS 13.1 and you get your new phone,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:42.320]   you can't just dump it all over onto your new phone. You have to upgrade your new phone to the beta
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:49.760]   of 13.1 and then transfer all of your phone, your current phone to that phone, if you're using
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:56.640]   a public beta or even a developer beta of 13.1 on the phone that you want to transfer all the
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:03.360]   information to sounds confusing. But so there's a lot, a lot going on there that has to be considered
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.920]   in terms of the betas versus what's coming out on Friday versus what's coming out the following
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.840]   Friday. I mean, it's only 10 days later. So it's not, I was an animal and I chose an old
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:17.680]   beta and old backup and just restored from a whole new backup. That's smart Renee.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:25.520]   By the way, that reminds me, we were asking this on iOS today, clean install or restore from backup.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.920]   What would you do with your new phone if you get one this Friday?
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.760]   There's reasons to do both. I will sometimes just completely start clean.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.680]   I was thinking of doing that. I haven't done that in so long. I thought I'd just start fresh.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:43.360]   So yes, it's fun because it's like cleaning out the closet. It's absolutely not necessary,
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.640]   but it's definitely fun to do to kind of make your phone feel really brand new.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:56.880]   But consider this your workflow is going to be really slow until you get everything in place.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.680]   You're going to be up all night moving icons around.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:05.520]   Yeah. And you're just going to forget some things like, oh, I forgot that I don't have,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.320]   you know, Google Drive on this phone yet. So now I have to go down that it and then I have to go
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.440]   sign it. And then I have to use my two factor authentication to get to it. So at first,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.960]   it's a little, you have to have patience when you wipe it clean and start over.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.560]   But I definitely recommend doing it every once in a while, at least.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.800]   I haven't done it in so long. I thought I'd do it this time.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.880]   Yeah. Just don't be mad when you realize that I don't even have my password.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:39.360]   I first thing I installed last pass. I mean, I have kind of an order of things that I do.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   So I think I, I know, Renee, you're going to probably just, you're just going to restore it, right?
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.160]   I did one of each. I did one just so that I would have, and I try to do that because I also want to
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.000]   live on a crudgy old backup the way a normal person would and not like, you know, there's,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.920]   there's two things that bug me about reviews. One is when you can tell they didn't install
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.720]   anything on the device and two, when you can see there's not even a SIM card in it.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.480]   I just don't even, I don't even know what's going on there.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.880]   Well, by the way, there is an e-SIM availability. So you don't have to have a SIM card in it.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   Well, you can, maybe like the phone's not going to activate. You got to activate it.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:17.120]   Yeah. So I did one of each just, I did, I didn't do both of them because I just wanted one up
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.000]   and running so I could use it as a camera. And the other one I wanted it to be my phone. And I'll
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.320]   add things back as I need to. Like I didn't reinstall all the apps on it because I think spring
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.080]   cleaning is good. But it takes too long if I, if I do both all the phones brand new. I also
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.680]   just missing like I can't even tweet it. I think this is a big enough change in iOS,
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.840]   a big enough hardware change that I kind of want to go through the setup from scratch,
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.640]   just to understand it better to go through all the settings to get a better idea.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.320]   So many disclosures Leo, like there are so many things that tell you what they're doing now.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.440]   Yeah. I mean, you have to.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.760]   It's like we went from Mario to Zelda. Yeah.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.280]   Like at some point we became Zelda.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:59.360]   Yeah. I am looking forward to iOS 13's privacy warnings. That's going to be a huge improvement.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:07.040]   Only because we'll know what apps are doing. I mean third party apps are really the Achilles
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.520]   heel of iOS. Yeah.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.280]   Yeah. I mean, it doesn't even think of this.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:11.600]   A lot.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.160]   I think that's a great move. The only risk is
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:23.440]   notification fatigue sets in for certain users that they stop. They stop looking at these things.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:27.920]   I'm a lot more concerned about it with Catalina than I am with with iOS 13.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:34.800]   But when you really are, hey, hey, there's a kind of a funny looking dog outside right now.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.640]   Hey, there's another funny looking dog, but it's a different kind of funny looking dog.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.960]   That means that when you get an alert that, hey, there is an actual cougar outside and making
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.600]   making moves towards your chicken coop. You just clicked it before it went. What?
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.080]   What? What? That cougar?
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.880]   For me, it's Pokemon Go because like every couple weeks it says Pokemon Go is using your location.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.800]   Do you still want it to be using your location? And I say no, but I want to hatch these shiny
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.880]   regional eggs. So I have to. Right.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.800]   And then I just press it and it shows me it shows knows where I've been and I just
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.840]   that's so creepy, but I need my shiny regional eggs. So I don't know.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.240]   And that's why I will not be installing Pokemon Go or Harry Potter Wizards United my new iPhone.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.080]   In a nutshell.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.720]   Take care of all your needs.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.520]   I don't know. You had such plans for that extra four or five hours of battery life.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.720]   Yeah. So you were saying, Renee, you actually went to an event on Saturday.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.520]   Yeah. I did the Pokemon Go community day because again, it's like it's just so much time
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.240]   and so much battery that it kills a cone faster than it's going.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:44.080]   That's a really that's that's the better test than any other. If it survives a Pokemon Go event,
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:52.800]   man, that's that's really impressive. So one issue, of course, is that you won't get this
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:58.560]   you one chip. None of the features are going to be available in 3.0. 13.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.400]   I keep saying three. I don't know why three. 13.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.800]   You move back around. It's an unlucky number, you know.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.400]   Jason still has a good by the way, by the way, Jason, happy fifth anniversary for six
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.440]   colors. He celebrated on the six. Yes. That's really awesome.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.320]   Congratulations. Great article by Jason. The U one chip in the 11 is the beginning of an
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:26.800]   ultra wideband revolution. Renee, what is what is UWB? What is you one? What is happening?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:33.360]   So it's a it's a very precise positioning system. So basically, the example that everyone's using
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:38.000]   right now is if you and Ian Laurie are standing on the other side of the room, I could point my
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.800]   iPhone specifically at you and airdrop would know to prioritize you without me having to go
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.240]   through the list and sort of find you would just say, Oh, you're pointing at Leo. You want to send
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.160]   this to Leo and you could do like this cool, you know, zapping motion with your phone.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:55.440]   And it's just it does that. Of course, all the dreams and expectations are that Apple is going
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.400]   to bake this into many, many more things, including that those tags that we didn't see at the event
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:06.640]   this time. But you being able to find something with a very high level of granularity, even indoors
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.200]   is sort of the holy grail for positioning everything from, you know, I'm going to I'm going to
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.920]   Twitter headquarters. How do I find the desk that Leo told me to sit at today to where's my parking
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.560]   spot to? I'm going to the mall. You know, where's where's my kid? All these sorts of things.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:25.440]   It just it handles them internally the way the GPS has been handling them externally.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:32.320]   So and imagine being in a room with a smart speaker and just pointing it at the smart speaker
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.600]   as opposed to here is a list of available speakers for you to connect to. It's it's such an important
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.760]   step to omit if you want to make these things you pick up this. All right. Will they put you one
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:49.040]   chips in all future Apple devices, including Max? I sure hope so. Sounds like it sounds like a T2
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:55.360]   kind of thing. Yeah. It's a feature. It's a feature that spawns other features. So
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.560]   it's especially when they start especially when they put in the hands of developers,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.360]   you see you get an app like halide camera that's that really gives you the example of what if
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:12.080]   the company can put really good hardware features and APIs into into a system and then the built-in
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   app that it gives you takes advantage of it or the publicized feature takes a good advantage of it.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.120]   But waiting till you get it in the hands of somebody who was someone like the developers of halide
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.160]   that is we can now make the most awesome camera app that cannot be matched on any other platform
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.080]   everywhere because we're going to dig into what this hardware can do and we're going to come up
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:35.520]   with ideas that are either too risky for Apple or that Apple had never considered. So this is why
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:41.840]   I hope that this becomes a feature of every single Apple product that comes out there. That could be
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.640]   a real switch sort of feature that oh wow. Why is it that your products are so much easier to connect
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.600]   to each other and are so much talked to each other so much more naturally than my mixture of
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.000]   products from three different manufacturers at home. Like well because Apple has this quote
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   standard and quote that only works with other Apple products and I would I hate lock-in. I hate
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.240]   when you a feature that might have been developed so that any developer or any hardware platform
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:16.560]   could support it is only supported by one but if it's good enough and I drop my phone
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:22.160]   then maybe I will replace the Android phone with an iPhone if I've been at a friend's house too
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:29.280]   often and been too jealous. Yeah by the way I should point that out Andy is an outlier here.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:34.720]   He's not buying the new iPhone because he uses an Android phone. Yeah I hope you get one in
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.160]   for review in the next two or three weeks usually I wait until the second wave anyway
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   but I will say that a lot of the reasons why I switched to Android in 2013 are either now
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:52.720]   irrelevant or mitigated by other advantages of the iPhone platform. So I'm not saying that I'm
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:58.880]   going to I'm planning to switch this year but I'm saying that this is the year that when I get my
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:06.960]   review unit for the next 30 or 60 days I will be thinking now Andy imagine a world in which you
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:15.360]   can have this phone forever. And because this is also the year that I do have the money specifically
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:21.760]   like under the mattress for a new pixel because I'm still running the Pixel 1 and the Pixel 4's
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:28.240]   come out this year. There's going to be a timer I'm going to have both phones and I'm going to be
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:35.760]   you know what I hate the I hate it like principle as yeah but yes but this is how these things
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:43.680]   work. Again in principle I absolutely hate lock-in but I am I have to also say that as a consumer
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:49.920]   sometimes you want the practical solution as opposed to the principle and the thing that is
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.320]   really getting me sort of one of the things that's getting me really interested in looking at the
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:00.160]   iPhone as a consumer again is if I had an iPhone I could have an Apple watch and not have to only
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:05.680]   use it just as a detached fitness watch that only syncs back when I fire up my get back home
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:12.560]   and fire up my my iPhone 7 which is the latest one that I own. That's how they get you.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:20.000]   Which is not that I mean in a way I don't want to be complaining that God is how horrible of Apple
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.920]   to make such wonderful products that I actually want to buy them but nonetheless they get yeah
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:33.600]   nonetheless the the the the the citizen activist journalist in myself saying naughty
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:39.280]   naughty Apple you could easily make this Apple watch Android compatible particularly as you're
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.960]   assuring people that you don't need to keep it attached to your phone iPhone day in and day out
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:53.280]   shame shame yeah I want the titanium black and shame shame. Andy what are some of the
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:59.200]   features or some of the the reasons that you switched in 2013 you kind of casually said like
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:04.240]   some of those aren't really relevant today what like give me an example of what what made you
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:10.720]   switch then that isn't really relevant today. For one thing like sharing sharing data from
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:16.960]   one app to another was an absolute mess. I like the changing of keyboards I like the ability
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.320]   to do have more control over my phone it make it make it do more interesting things now that they've
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.840]   really upgraded the sharing system now that they've really updated the the notification
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.760]   and again we're talking about 2013 versus 2019 they've updated the notification system is to it's
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:39.680]   as good as anything else. I like the fact that I like the fact that shortcuts gives me a lot of
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.160]   that control that I was missing from the I've I have been missing from the iPhone for years the
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   ability to simply I want my phone to work the way that I want it to work and not the way that
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:55.920]   Apple has a vision for how I should want it to work. There's there's still be a lot of things
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   I would miss and at the top of that list would probably be the Google Assistant because really
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:09.120]   the number the number of times where it took me the the best features excuse me my latest favorite
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:16.000]   feature of it is just if there's something on the screen that you want to act upon I don't have to
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.120]   like highlight it and then like do a Google search for this or do whatever I can just simply
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:26.480]   long press on the home button and it will say oh well here's the here's the restaurant that
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.600]   that's mentioned in this article and if you touch this button we'll go to like the reviews page for
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.800]   it touch this button to do what we're to make a reservation for tonight for this restaurant
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:42.240]   and the number of times where it's been like this is exactly how every single phone should work then
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:48.640]   you know you know that I don't want to I'm not interested in in prepositions I know that but
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:54.320]   here's proper names here are place locations here are phone numbers the the the number of times where
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.520]   I was a we were having we're having a discussion I was up to dinner with some friends and
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.560]   we didn't know there's a dish that involved porchetta and there was some difference of
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.560]   opinion at the table what porchetta actually was and the ability to simply look at the
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:13.520]   milk of the menu again long press on the button and hey here's a picture of what porchetta looks like
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.600]   like okay that's I guess unless you want to fight with google and that's and it's the exact it's
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.240]   it's it's such an apple sort of feature where you don't you're not impressed with it it's just a
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.880]   tool that you use and that you desperately miss when it's gone but that said there's a lot of stuff
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:37.360]   going on an apple right now that makes me really keen to really think hard about if that if
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:43.280]   I might not be happier with an app with an iPhone right now camera being one of them too so
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   you mentioned hailight I was kind of curious if you played with this
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:53.680]   thing that apple showed off in the stage using filmic of recording with multiple lenses
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.000]   simultaneously on the phone can you do that yet Renee?
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.440]   Lord it's in beta and I don't have the beta I don't know if Laurie does but we we got to try it at
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:09.040]   the hands-on area in that four cameras all three back angles and the so I we could film a tech
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:15.440]   video Leo where we have the hero shot the close-up the set shot and our reaction all at once can
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.680]   you do more than two you can do how many how many lenses at once this conflicting we were told
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.760]   both four and two and I don't have the beta and I haven't heard back from the developer yet I can't
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.840]   wait to see that we're definitely told both and for people like you and me who do video that's
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   going to be really an amazing feature I we were talking about an iOS today and it sounds like
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:40.080]   it's not just it's going to be an iOS 13 feature it's not just going to be on the new phones even
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:45.280]   last year's iPhones will do this which just shows you how much headroom is in these processors
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.760]   that's could be that maybe the new ones do four and those do two I don't know yeah maybe yeah
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:58.080]   I think that that's what it comes down to is um apples opening up the the ability for developers
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:03.760]   to yeah to the API more than one camera yes even the ten are supposedly which it would be
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.600]   the front facing camera and the back facing camera would be the two cameras that they would allow
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   them to to put that into their system for which I was just assuming the new high speed storage
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:20.800]   plus super high speed processors but it can be done in the 10 aren't too wow but it also sounds
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:27.440]   like it might really be bad for might not work well on those yeah yeah yeah yeah okay it gets back
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:31.600]   to what we're discussing gets back to we were discussing earlier features that be that enable
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:36.560]   and emboldened other features like the just simply the ability to have desktop class storage
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:42.400]   speeds where you can now write to storage so damn fast that a lot of the bollin X that were that
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   would stop developers from shipping a product are now like well it was kind of okay functional
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.440]   when I was when I was developing this for iOS 12 and and older hardware but now it's not
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:58.560]   ridiculous it actually works so now we can actually think about things like saving multiple streams
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:04.480]   at the same time and just letting people make their make their edits later or even better just
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:12.160]   I'm just a an AI powered app that will automatically just give you a first pass of like white shots
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.640]   it's a it's a using using a lot of that spatial awareness say okay I can I can sense that there
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.800]   are there's more than one voice so I'm going to automatically cut to the white shot for this
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.160]   now I can sense that there's only one person talking so now I'm going to cut to the single
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:30.080]   that I've set up or I'm going to cut to a 4k in which why I'm doing a dynamic crop there's so much
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.120]   stuff that you can do just because of this basic feature that's been baked right and made
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:42.000]   available to everybody. Wow anything to say about the processor it was interesting to see that
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.080]   and we talked about this last week apple brought up the chip guy out of the stage first time I
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:53.680]   can remember anybody from the chip team on stage you probably can't tell just using the phone that
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:02.160]   this is this amazing bionic a 13 bionic or can you so my trick is usually to try to peg it like with
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.800]   the iPhone 7 you could peg it with portrait mode and then with the iPhone 10 you could peg it
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.680]   sometimes with Animoji dependent because it was trying to just do so many calculations and I have
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.400]   not been able to peg this one yet I've tried different like night mode I'm trying to see if I can do
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.920]   it with night mode because I'm not quite sure what the load is but one of the things that apple
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.440]   started doing was not building processors for the tasks of the current phone but for they want like
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.360]   three or four years of headroom so that you can keep getting updates and the phones will work really
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.240]   well it's part of that whole initiative yeah that's what that's what I took from that filmic thing
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.160]   that it'll work on last year's phones means there was a lot of headroom in the 812 yeah
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:47.840]   you know i'm all I can't ability one more thing they kept saying Wi-Fi 6 that's the standard formerly
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:55.280]   known as 802.11 ax yeah but you'd have to have a Wi-Fi 6 router to take advantage of that they will
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:02.560]   be coming out later I guess in 2020 from most people but think about enterprise your office suddenly
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.880]   gets an upgrade and suddenly your phone lasts a lot longer and your device is last a lot longer
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:13.280]   can you dig into anything but Wi-Fi yeah that would be very interesting so you probably didn't
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:19.440]   get a chance to test that Renee no I don't have a I want one I don't know I want no that one
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:26.160]   uh I think a number of companies have announced uh tp link neck gear um so there will be Wi-Fi
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:33.200]   six routers someday soon and you'll be glad then that your phone has Wi-Fi 6 will they be
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.720]   home kick compatible though I don't know I don't care all right let's take a break and then I want
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.960]   to talk about arcade because some of us already have it some of us will be getting it on Thursday
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.120]   some of us won't be coming to work on Friday our show day that's another reason to switch to
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:58.080]   iPhone I don't want to have to carry my my iPad every year oh yeah man oh baby our show today

[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:26.400]   who's been playing arcade show of hands I know you have Laurie oh I'm sorry I'm playing
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.240]   arcade right now Renee hasn't had a moment to do it because he's been busy writing but I bet
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.960]   you're gonna sit down and start playing some games as soon as you get a nap.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:41.120]   The thing that convinced me is I was talking to my little 10 year old godson on the weekend
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:45.200]   and he wasn't sure about it and then his brother goes that's because you download every game that
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.240]   you see an ad for and it turned out he had like 200 games on his phone just because every time an
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.320]   ad pops up in a game he's playing and he gets frustrated he just hits that button and down
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   what's the next one and that just carried the crap out of me so like no no you're going on
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.640]   arcade media so some of us are already playing it because if you were on the 13 iOS 13 beta you
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.240]   you get it it's simple you go to the app store and all of a sudden that arcade button that's been
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:16.480]   useless is now really doing something and showing you the games I counted 59 games this morning there
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.000]   may be more it's going to take them about a month to get to the 100 plus games games in every category
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.720]   I'll tell you my takeaway on this this is going to kill gaming on iOS because why would you do
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.440]   anything but pay 15 bucks to and play these games they're fantastic i bucks yeah i mean what i say
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:43.520]   55 five yeah i think you know the only games that are going to survive are the games that
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:49.840]   um are big name titles that'll do well because everybody will want to play the latest right
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:56.080]   well also the ones that are also the ones that are multi-platform the ones that are not just that
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.880]   that can also be offered for Android phones as well uh interest it was it was an interesting
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:07.840]   extra tidbit that we learned that uh it's exclusives meeting exclusives to phone platforms only uh and
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:14.800]   that uh because i i can imagine that any developer or any team that puts the amount of work that is
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.680]   involved in creating a game that games that are as polished as these you kind of want to release a
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.400]   version for the switch it seems as though there's a lot of money to be had there uh but the the
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.400]   so but they still can right exactly for other platform for other platforms not for other phone
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.840]   handsets but there's a lot but there are a lot of people there are a lot of developers who
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.560]   absolutely want to target android number one because they can get away with a lot more
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.320]   and secondly because there are a lot there there are a lot of people who uh don't have
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.120]   a lot of people who have android handsets that don't necessarily have money for
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:52.720]   iPhones but they do have money for uh buck 99 for every single loot box that comes along
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.160]   this is i mean my take on it was that these are the games that are made by the developers who
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.880]   you know they just they would not be able to survive making these games for iOS or android in the
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.000]   open market there's just like there wouldn't be enough pay to play like the gating would be obnoxious
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.480]   they'd have to deform their game too much they wouldn't have the money to do it to take the risk
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.520]   for it and that this just like because there's some really cool moody experimental games in here
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.280]   yeah there's some really odd games that's right that's right yeah so this is what the
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.560]   this is what the golf this is what the golf which is not the first one you might pick up because
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:34.720]   you might think it's a golf game it's really fun um now i'm playing with bowling balls i wish i had
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:41.120]   jeez lilies this is the daily challenge you're seeing all the ps4 and xbox controllers
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.200]   yeah i'm putting an iPhone i pad on mac i dug up my old steel series that i bought for the apple tv
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.880]   and never used and uh it works great with it and a lot of these games are really uh better with a
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.560]   controller although you you said that you were playing ocean horn uh larry was that the one you
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:04.160]   want i spent hours playing it last night it's a really fun game all of my everything ran out of
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.200]   battery i was just sitting there playing it and just like well this is so much fun so this is a game
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.600]   that was a a triple a title really for ios some years ago this is ocean horn
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.480]   too it's running on the unreal engine so it's great some of the games are graphically very
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:23.840]   simple they all have beautiful music i thought that was interesting um but this one is i'm thinking
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.200]   on its name but the card game where you're going through the memories of a troubled
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.840]   child like it's just so interesting the choices that people made yeah that's the beautiful moody
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:38.080]   a 90s card game there's rayman there's a lego so there's some big names this is an odd one that
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.640]   probably a lot of people won't download because it's a text game it's called dear reader
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:50.320]   and i bet you didn't see this one larry i did and actually i i haven't downloaded it yet but i
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.680]   was definitely interested in it because i do like word games i do too yeah i do crossword stuff really
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:04.080]   fun it's weird it's a strange um it's a strange there's a there's a there's a bookstore again
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.840]   none of this has in-app purchases or micro purchases oh that's coming soon i guess
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:15.360]   so you can you can wander and not feel too you know too like i'm gonna spend money here
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.040]   um should i play oh i have to earn some ink that's to to buy it that's the way you buy it so i've
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:27.120]   been playing pride and prejudice i've got allison wonderland no you laugh Andy but it's i know i
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.920]   know i know i'm laughing because i'm entertained by the concept of this game playing pride and
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.360]   prejudice so i'm on chapter five lizzy lydia and jane those are the whoops these are the daughters
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.200]   let's let's begin and it's just a this is the rearrange game where you have to touch lines to
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:53.760]   exchange them um and i guess some of these lines are out of order uh other girls no oh i'm losing
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:59.200]   some ink i can't i don't know the pressure recommend them replied he they are all silly
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:10.960]   and ignorant there we go like other girls but okay there we go and then this with this oh thank
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.880]   god i gained some ink ink that i had lost okay i imagine imagine that on expert mode you've got
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.440]   ulysses and you've got one post that's such a yes on the test that would be fun wouldn't it
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.560]   i haven't gotten far enough to know if you've got the ulysses but wouldn't that be fun
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   yeah this is this is kind of completely not an arcade game this is just a word game but fun i
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.360]   they do download just like any app would in fact um there is no search in the arcade tab which is
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.760]   a little weird so if you're trying to find a game you actually search in the regular app store
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:52.080]   maybe if you type arcade in the name of the game there are some odd games this is to me not a real
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.920]   sweet spot game it's called bleak sword it's an eight-bit game and it's really clearly designed
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:04.880]   for the phone because it's in portrait mode uh but it's a little a little odd devolver is one of the
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:11.360]   titles that has one of the studios that has quite a few games on here i did notice rene that uh some
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.760]   of these studios or some of these games they produced by apple which i'm going to take to
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.360]   mean apple gave them some some bucks to do this right yeah i'm i it's just i get the strange vibe
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.560]   that apple feels and they should responsible for the current state of gaming at least co responsible
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:33.040]   because the the the entire there was this race to the bottom and pay to play and all these stuff
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.040]   just happened and there are like people like to knock apple and say they're not you know they
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.960]   don't get gaming but a lot of them are gamers they just thought that casual gaming was
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.880]   the sweet spot and it hasn't it probably hasn't played out the way everybody hoped it would and
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.680]   this is sort of like with great power comes great responsibility spider-man mea culpa
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.480]   where they try to invent something just nice people that is one of the concerns i have though apple
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.440]   really is capable as you can tell by by changing small rules in the abstract changing the whole
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.120]   ecosystem as you pointed out oh i lost uh it's partially apple but it's like us and developers
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   it's like what happens when like wooden toys don't exist anymore and like when you take away
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.320]   scarcity you come to an age of ubiquity we have now pop apps and pop games and that's a very
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.240]   different market than developers had where there was huge constraints on software still right i
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.760]   worry that this is going to change things though that as i said this is going to change the experience
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.280]   of of game developers in the app store if you're not an arcade do you even have a shot
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:38.400]   why would i if i pay five bucks i got a hundred two shots my i am sad as in the cross platforms
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.360]   i think we'll still do very well i'm totally satisfied okay and i i also think there's a lot
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.560]   of game developers and and larger companies that don't want to participate in arcade so they're
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:55.440]   going to work harder to provide good quality games for people to play instead of those sort of throw
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:00.640]   away um you know download and play and give me all your money games they're they're just going
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:08.480]   to have to work harder um you know that the sort of normal now today is download a game for free
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.000]   and then spend five hundred dollars micro micro purchasing your way through the game and
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.840]   i think apple arcade will change the face of that by saying um stop doing that right and make good
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.840]   games that people want to play and they're willing to pay upfront for um i personally will pay five
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:34.400]   dollars a month for apple arcade and i will go buy other games for five 10 15 dollars and then i'll
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:40.800]   go buy games on my nintendo switch for sixty dollars because there's there's different levels of game
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.320]   game players well i don't deny that it's not going to hurt switch or xbox or pc gaming i'm not
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.600]   saying that i feel like though it's going to very much change the ecosystem on the on the apple
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.680]   he is a game store i mean well i don't know i don't know why you would buy anything but this you've
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:03.280]   paid the five bucks a month and you've got more games and you could possibly play well for some
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.400]   people that's enough but for others they want more than just what's going to be available in
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:16.080]   i think you're going to see a complete decimation of the game of non-archade games there i think that
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.160]   there are still two big questions yet to be yet to be answered or at least i don't i don't know the
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.440]   answers to number one how much money is each developer going to make off of this
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.600]   the contribution to arcade and secondly how much control is apple going to inflict upon the creator
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:38.240]   of this game all the way all the way from hey your music track is okay but it's not great and it
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.400]   doesn't take advantage of the of this new spatial sound system so we're not going to let you
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.720]   it's you're not going to let you approve it for our system until you fix these things that we don't
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.760]   like about your game all the way to we think this is sort of a touchy issue and we don't really want
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.520]   to but it's sort of your your game is a little bit icky and it's not going to wonder it's not going
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.960]   to hurt fortnight i i i grant you that it's not going to hurt fortnight but if i'm a developer i'm
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.400]   going to look at another platform at this point i i i would not i mean it could be it's it's also
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.760]   possible that apple arcade is going to be sort of like how every every actor every like big time
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:24.320]   actor kind of their dream is to uh for make three movies in a row that are superhero movies that
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.720]   make a billion dollars in the box office that guarantee that they don't get paid a penny less
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.480]   than 20 million dollars plus five percent of of of burs receipts but they also want to make the
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.160]   fourth movie to be an Oscar sort of contender movie that will make absolutely nothing but will
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.720]   elevate their profile in their prestige it's possible that this is going to be a like a game
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.440]   studio that really wants to make here is the here's the beautiful game that we can't possibly put
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.480]   before uh have a success with in any other fashion than with uh then with apple arcade
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.160]   but we also have our own work that we can't make a game like cupcake cuphead underneath the uh the
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:06.400]   apple the apple arcade system so we're going to do it that way yeah does does does does does the
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.200]   does the mermaid really have to be wearing a seashell brock can't can be can be can be
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.440]   should be wearing sort of a onesie it's like i just think it's really important to understand that
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.920]   apple did change the gaming space with just micro payments with you know small rules that apple
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.800]   makes are gonna are gonna absolutely change things and this is not just a small thing this is
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:35.840]   this is really uh this is this is a whole new world for gaming and i just i don't know
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:41.920]   karsten what about your kids do they ever play ios games do you think uh we are an android
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:48.960]   okay so you don't but if if we if we were an apple uh family we would absolutely have this
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.000]   yeah you get what five six people uh five bucks a month yes there's no question in my mind that
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.200]   unlimited games there's games in almost every uh not every category but many different categories
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.560]   so if you're a tower defense gamer or if you like platformers if you like eight bit games
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.960]   there's there's choices for you there's sim style games there's nothing like minecraft
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:16.000]   there's nothing like fortnite um yet yet well but see i wonder if apple i don't see any first
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.520]   person shooters exactly there are there are weapons but they're all kind of like you know shooting a
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:32.960]   pie cannon yeah i i don't i don't think these games are going to focus on minecraft and
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.400]   no first person shooter games there are kames there are kames there are k games yeah there are
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.840]   going to be games that that uh that you'll play for a while and then next month's games will come
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.560]   out and then you'll play those by the way they do have multiplayer it seems to be uh we were playing
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:54.320]   hot lava earlier and it looked like there were other people jumping over the lava in the room with us
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:00.640]   uh and there are definitely uh scores of other people i was playing a real this is the frogger
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:05.920]   game that they showed off which is a heck of a lot of fun they've really actually taken frogger
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:12.480]   to the next level but i was playing uh a fun game where you're doing kind of solving railroad
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.320]   here i'll show you uh it's like a railroad game except it's not it's a it's a highway game where
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:25.920]   was it motor mini motorways where you're uh creating an urban uh landscape and you get to
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:32.000]   choose the city and they already have uh top scores uh so there are you know there are other people
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.440]   playing these um this is i think uh so i'd build this is los angeles and i've got to build these
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.800]   freeways there's you know you get parts that week is going by i've got 46 cars but i'm starting to
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:52.640]   get some congestion over here in the in the red i could get more red people let me let me drive
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.960]   oh i don't know what i'm going to do here let me build a highway around here
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:06.960]   oh i got to destroy that now that's a waste oh i feel like time is oh i'm off the board oh
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:12.720]   anyway you get the idea it it these are this is my kind of game i like puzzle games like this
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:21.520]   um i don't know i i think this is going to have a big impact on gaming in general i'm not
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:27.760]   sure exactly what the impact will be but you're right it's going to be more uh casual gamers right
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:35.520]   yeah okay did you play any uh rene or you didn't have time i play them uh they had some demos set up
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.840]   that i had a chance to play and that was fun i'm terrible i was terrible at almost all of them so
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.560]   i got other people to play when i was shooting my video but i did manage to fall off of very many
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.720]   things yes there's a lot of falling i think it's washed by very many things a lot of melting and
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:54.000]   falling and squashing yes we're gonna by the way chris philasko for an engadget also has uh his
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.880]   iphone his review is up we will have him on twitter on sunday to talk as well about this so we will
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:05.920]   have more uh going on you have an article everything apple killed after the iphone left an event
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:11.760]   we put it up every year it's just letting everybody know what's uh what's no longer
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.360]   available which actually wasn't this much this year it was somewhat expected you know the
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.880]   i thought it was odd that they killed series four watches but kept series three and five
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:30.480]   well they they kind of do that with with having sort of their entry level priced
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.480]   device you know they they've done that with iphone in the past two with se and and the
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.400]   five c they would keep it a lot longer even six they would keep it a lot longer than
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:46.720]   you know even though they're upgrading the line so with with the apple watch the three is the
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.640]   sort of entry level priced one it's smaller it doesn't require as much going on
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.960]   and it's definitely a bigger difference in the three and the five and there is from the four
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.320]   and the five there's only a slight yeah yeah uh they killed the seven uh they they did not kill
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:07.600]   the se they are still selling the eight they killed the ten s and ten s max so you go right from eight
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:14.880]   to uh ten do they still do the ten and you also know that this is this this line
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.840]   this is stuff they killed off that wasn't killed off earlier yeah so the it's not a list so there
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.720]   the ten wasn't available that last year anyway so and the se wasn't available last year either
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:32.320]   so there's no se correct but there isn't eight and eight plus where though because sometimes
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:37.920]   they'll keep fulfilling for carriers or certain regional um vendors like you know like the ten
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:43.360]   might still be lurking around in india or some other country right it's just what apple themselves
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.480]   doesn't sell so the base model the cheapest iphone will be an iphone eight is that right
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:55.760]   yes correct yeah and then there'll be no ten or ten s so you'll have to just jump right to the
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:02.560]   eleven oh that's interesting yeah okay well the ten are the ten are is continued okay good yes so
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:10.720]   iphone eight eight plus ten are eleven and eleven pro okay so that's a price of they drop the price
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:17.440]   of the ones that were around last year too so um the ten are for example like until
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:24.240]   seven days ago the ten are was a seven hundred and forty nine dollar iphone and now it's only
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:29.360]   six ninety nine so you know they they've dropped the price of it to make it more enticing or
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:35.280]   i'm sorry they they dropped at a hundred and fifty dollars it's five ninety nine now correct so um
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.200]   you know that was the top of the line phoned until just a few days ago so the fact that it's so
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:48.480]   so much less expensive is really cool for people who still want a really nice fast working phone it
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:54.240]   was it was the most popular phone last year and like the most popular phone until last week right
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.520]   so you know like it it's a great price for a phone that's still great quality a lot of people will
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.800]   want the ten are that's a really good choice if your price apple now had we've for a long time
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.480]   we said apple is never gonna sell cheap phones but you know what if you look at the ipad if you
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:13.280]   look at the iphone they really do have a pretty broad lineup they don't have a fifty dollar phone
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.200]   but but that ten are is a very affordable phone and an affordable watch and an affordable
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:25.120]   ipad yep that's why i really still think that one of the greatest announcements collectively
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.880]   of last week was the fact that it's a lot it's you can still make the complaint that apple
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:37.360]   is not as available to people who have less money than other makes models and brands are
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:42.480]   but that's that argument has been blunted quite a bit when you have a tablet that's as good as
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:49.440]   uh the what's this it was series six we're series seven ipad thank you seven for three hundred twenty
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.000]   nine dollars where you can't really point at something and say that well this is where they cut
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.760]   corners when you have uh when they have them like keeping an older but still very very functional
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.960]   watch on the price list and cutting the price down to make it more accessible when you have
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:13.120]   a fun they still a fun when you have a uh a mid-range android phone now having to compete with apples
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:19.360]   top of the range uh iphone from just a year ago that's really that's real progress and something
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:27.600]   i'm really really happy to see um we there's no really way to know how well these are selling
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.040]   i mean i guess all you can do is look at how the shipping dates move out do we have a sense that
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:40.320]   these new phones are selling well i know Ming qi qo says that the iphone 11 pro and the pro max
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:46.400]   of a cannon for 55 percent of pre-orders but i don't know how he would know that i mean smoke
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.640]   in mirrors but the usually the higher priced ones go on pre-order day because it's the nerds who do
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.680]   a lot of the pre-ordering and then like the ten hour was just steady month after month after
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.800]   know how well they're doing you'd have to know how many they made and some people do like head
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.800]   like they call stores and ask me how many there you know it's but it but apple is a sells most
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.680]   of them i think especially uh in the western hemisphere and they're very tight but that's right
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.560]   right but they but the analysts have analysts have pretty good models by now you can't you can't
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.760]   necessarily expect uh accept their words as gospel but they're giving they're selling financial
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.880]   advice based on the value of this information that they're providing uh to clients so it's
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:32.240]   pretty good but it's not worthless but uh you should it's an interesting data point let's just say
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.080]   i just never know if they're selling it to inform clients or they're selling it to get me to short
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.920]   so they're trying to get them underwater that's why reputation is everything that's why you have
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.400]   to point to a crack record there is other news uh apple has put a quarter of a billion dollars
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.080]   into corning corning of course makes gorilla glass they'd put two hundred million dollars into them
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.640]   earlier now another quarter of a billion um that's part of their advanced manufacturing fund apple's
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:07.440]   been doing this with other uh partners uh for some time now but that's uh i guess it's kind of proof
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.200]   even though apple doesn't use the phrase gorilla glass that that's what's being used in these
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.080]   iphones it's funny so they work with corning to make something that they put in iphones that is
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.360]   when their window of exclusivity ends is called the new gorilla glass right okay so it's the next
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.400]   gorilla glass then yeah okay little be announced as gorilla glass seven or something in like three
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:32.960]   to six months okay that makes sense uh how about the apple the new apple care monthly payment is there
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.160]   any anything to say about that they've decided to if you want to go monthly you can keep it going
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:44.320]   past two years if you want i like i wonder how that works out in terms of getting your new phone
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:51.120]   the reason that apple care seem to have worked in the past is you're sort of you your limited time
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.720]   kind of takes care of your phone for the most part until you upgrade to a new one so if you're
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:03.200]   you know a holdout if you keep an iphone a lot longer like a success or success plus um you know
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.840]   how does that work as it gets to the end of the life of that phone in terms of you know apple sort
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:15.120]   of they they put certain devices into the we don't we don't repair these anymore kind of world
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:20.800]   and it's it does say in the in the terms and conditions that they will just cancel your
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:24.720]   apple care and give you 30 days notice that they're going to cancel it but
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:31.760]   it's it's interesting to see that this that's so you know it's it's a warranty if your iphone
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:36.000]   that never ends in a way and it acknowledges that people are keeping their iphones longer but it is
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.360]   by the way not cheaper to do it monthly it's eight dollars a month for an iphone 10r or 150
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.720]   dollars for 24 months so it's considered it's not not inconsiderably more expensive if you do it
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:58.720]   monthly i paid $199 for a two-year extension on the on the pro max i've fun 11 pro max
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:05.040]   i don't remember what the monthly was but uh is should people get the monthly if they think
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.720]   they're gonna keep the phone more than two years is that the point of it i think so yeah if if i
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.920]   you know if i had a phone that i knew i was keeping for four if if year three comes along and i'm
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.760]   you know i'm getting close to that point where you know what if something goes wrong with my phone
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   and then i can't fix it after after my apple care is gone this allows me to have the security
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:33.840]   of knowing that if something were to happen if you know the port breaks or the the button falls off
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.800]   that i can still go back to apple and get a repair and not have it cost a fortune it would
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:44.000]   you know kind of fit within the repair cost of things uh broken screen for example that you could
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:51.200]   go back into apple after your normal apple care would have would have um expired and get that
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.800]   screen repair repaired or replaced for that same price with apple care so this seems like a really
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:03.040]   good idea for people who want to keep a phone a long time and don't feel particularly safe or
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:08.160]   comfortable going to third party repair shops they can just continue to take it to apple and it won't
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:13.680]   cost as much as it would take it to apple outside of warranty i neglected to mention that uh the
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:19.680]   arcade uh is available to some early users of ios 13 but everybody's going to get it thursday
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:28.320]   right on the ninth and that's when ios 3.0 comes out it is 499 i'm sorry you're right thank you
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.920]   no correct me i don't know why i keep saying three 13 can we just take 10 off of everything and start
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:39.440]   over i'd like i'd like to just you i would just think about this we just call it we live in a world
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.640]   we live in a world right now where mac OS windows and android are all on 10
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.440]   10 all the same time 10 we're all tens even oldest operating systems in the new
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:56.560]   s-g even samson note is 10 even galaxy is 10 it's all 10 yeah 10's the right number 10 yes uh
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:04.160]   iphone 13 well ios 13 will come out on thursday and so will your arcade just so you know but it
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:11.840]   won't be available to ipad users because ipad os doesn't come out until the oh 30 so
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:18.480]   how do we add them on guys right and and we will have a review of apple arcade on hands on tech
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:27.200]   yeah we spent mike and i spent 54 minutes of our hour-long show ios today uh playing games and so
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.760]   we're gonna put a big chunk of that uh on uh hot and then some of it'll be on ios somebody has two
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:38.400]   lio some oh it was so much fun so uh if you want to see more of those games uh before uh it comes out
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:47.200]   rene if one were to have a apple watch series five when would ones embargo lift
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.480]   you know the apple people had them all you know the app to the event and none of them and none
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:57.200]   of them have written anything yet can you believe any reviews yet so i feel like the embargo for
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:03.200]   the 11 lifted today uh maybe the embargo for the apple watch would lift tomorrow is it
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.400]   sorry it's normally like i don't want it i would have had something last week
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:13.360]   they're all sleeping on the job okay yeah that's a good non-answer we'll we'll be watching we'll be
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:19.040]   watching uh you just gotta pull the tiger's tail don't you i have to pull it pull it pull it i have
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:25.040]   to i have to i think if if if there was an embargo lifting tomorrow nay wouldn't be here he'd be
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:31.520]   i guess he'd be right i'd be right i don't know well lory gill called it on the invite date so i'm
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:37.520]   gonna just go with lory lory says so that's right strategy let's take a break our picks of the week
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.120]   coming up as we wrap up this very special mac break weekly really fun to have rene richie back
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:50.000]   and lory gill back from the apple event and the anaco we just hear all the time that's our job
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.480]   that's that's what we do our show today brought to you by zip recruiter actually doc rock was fun
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.400]   last week i really enjoyed him brought to you by zip recruiter it is the best way to hire we just
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.080]   hired a production assistant all right miles is brand new how did we find him it's pretty easy
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:13.600]   zip recruiter see here's the deal when you're down a person it's important right that you find the
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.160]   right person you don't want to rush into it because hiring the right person is critical a bad employee
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.560]   is not a good thing a great employee can make a big difference in your company no matter what the
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.880]   position so there's that you want to do it right but at the same time you're also working extra
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:33.040]   hard because you're down a person you're like you're like in the employee penalty box you know uh
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.760]   you so that's the time to go to zip recruiter let's figure the right persons out there somewhere

[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.400]   called text mate do you remember that was the greatest right it was the best ruby editor i just
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.240]   loved it not only is he still around they just released the final 2.0 it's been in beta for some

[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.080]   they're out officially 2.0 thank you macromates i think macromates is really just one guy
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:19.040]   but you can't pay for it if you want i paid for it ages ago
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.360]   fifty seven dollars it's the missing editor but you can also use it for free and i think it is
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:32.240]   fantastic highly recommended and a nako what do you got for us uh kind of a new favorite app on
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:38.160]   the iphone so we're talking a lot about uh like night shot and long exposures today uh recently i
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:44.240]   found out that the makers of the halide app create have come out with a app called specter which is
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:51.280]   all about long exposure and what i love about it is number one it's it's it's has the same sort of
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:58.080]   ui vibe as halide it just looks like uh i wish that not i wish that my toaster behaved as well as
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.760]   this app does it's just so satisfying to use this camera app but also that they really have figured
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.640]   they really have thought about why do people want long exposures and so that they have built in
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:14.320]   auto sensing modes for everything so do you want the long exposure because it's at night and there
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.880]   isn't much light great do that that's fine and not only that but we will also automatically
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:24.480]   stabilize the camera and give you a nice little like interactive sort of dingus on the screen
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   so you can see how steadily you're holding the camera or if you're on a tripod we'll sense that
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.960]   it's so that we'll sense that as well and then we'll go absolutely nuts and unlock all kinds of
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.520]   new processing that we can do for you uh sometimes people want long exposure because
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.760]   they want to see like a night shot where you can see trails of headlights and tail lights or
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:47.760]   of moving waters you actually see the flowing of the water well great they can actually do that as
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.280]   well and sometimes you do it because you want to do this photoshop trick where you lock you
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.920]   lean your phone against something absolutely stationary at like Disney World and then you take
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:04.480]   like a cajillion photos and then you basically tell photoshop give me a composite of all these 200
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.200]   photos in which only in which all the pixels that never change from that that are common
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.520]   from time to time are remain the same and so you wind up with the shot of Disney World with no
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.160]   people or no moving anything inside it and we'll do that as well and it's a three bucks it's one
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:25.920]   of these apps where it's one of the reasons why beyond the the hardware of the iphones camera and
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:33.280]   beyond the processing that that it's image processor does the the iphones seems to attract a lot of
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:38.560]   people who take photography seriously and who want to have lots and lots of fun taking pictures so
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.280]   some of the best pictures that i ever take or maybe some of the favorite pictures i ever take
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:48.320]   are when like my my right share is a little bit late or someone is a little bit late
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.600]   uh i've got just i've got some time just to hang around and so but i've got like a at least a half
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.600]   charge on my phone and i'm saying okay let's see if this camera can do this or hey this kind of
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:03.200]   interesting how the sun is reflecting off of that building and i bet that i can't get a good
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.840]   picture of it but let's see what we can do with it and getting having a three dollar app like
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.640]   like specter on your phone means you can spend more time like that playing around with what your
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.280]   camera can do and then finding out that oh my god three weeks later you forgot you took the picture
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:24.080]   like wow how did i get that picture that was amazing so three bucks super super fun uh you're
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.720]   you'll really really enjoy playing with this app and also i want to see the developers of apps like
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.800]   this have three dollars i want to have i see them have consistently more than three dollars but
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.920]   it's very it pleases me a lot to know that i have i have given them three dollars of which they are
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:46.000]   allowed to keep most of it from apple i agree from lux optics the makers of halide specter with the
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.320]   r e on an er mix mix up with the night mode of the new oh man i know i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.360]   i'm pretty impressive yeah if you if you if you go to the uh the the blog for the halide camera app
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:02.240]   they've done their own like little discussion of the new the new hardware features and the new
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.280]   capabilities of the camera without of the new iphones cameras without having their hands on
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.520]   on without officially having their hands on any hardware that they're willing to acknowledge
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.200]   but this is why i'm super super excited to see what the next edition of halide is going to be like
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.240]   because when they take advantage of all the new things that are available including like a new
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.680]   shot the highest shutter speed of of of the new iphone is something like 125 000 of a second up from
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:35.920]   like 40 000 of a second it's like oh you could do interesting things with that do not especially
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:40.160]   if you were a clever developer who has lots of experience in writing camera apps for the iphone
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:46.240]   yeah can't wait to see the guy who made twitter for twitter for mac and the guy who made the original
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:54.160]   find my friends they know their stuff rday your pick of the week so i realized that not we're talking
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:58.000]   about all these new phones whenever we do that i'm conscientious that not everybody updates you
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.160]   know they're not upset about it they're just like i'm gonna wait a few years and then when i'm ready
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:07.760]   i'll get my next phone but like lory said they might be looking at that battery life real jealous
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:14.880]   you know a little bit sideways but apple makes battery cases for many of the iphones they're going
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.160]   all the way back to iphone seven and they're currently available for the 10r which is still
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:27.040]   being sold but also the 10s and the 10s uh max if those are the phones that you have and this is
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.520]   like slapping a whole other phone on the back of your phone but not having to carry around that
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:36.640]   much heavier double phone all the time you put it on when you need it i was using it religiously
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.760]   not just for pokemon go community day but also for traveling especially when i was roaming because
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.560]   you're you're the networks away or never like the networks at home and the radio just gets hot
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.760]   trying to keep a connection and your battery goes down and airports have lousy service and sometimes
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:58.000]   your hotel has lousy reception and just it's a nightmare for battery life and one of these cases
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.760]   just makes it so much easier to uh to suffer um with all those sorts of circumstances they're
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.960]   not cheap but they're not overly expensive and they've typically just doubled the useful battery life
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.440]   of my device so i put them on when i need them take them off when i don't um and i love them i
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:21.280]   noticed they don't make them for the 11 not yet you know they they took them until
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:26.160]   december to make them for the seven until january to make them for the 10s and 10s max
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.720]   uh they are the same size you will fit in them but they will cover up your flash right um and
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:37.120]   and half the camera from the but it is just uh rubber you could cut it i suppose it would be ugly
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.480]   but some people said that but i'm never going to suggest it because i don't know if there's some
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:48.320]   sort of like alien blood in there or something yeah yeah so i thought maybe there was just a cocky
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:57.360]   way of saying you don't need it for the uh i phone 11 i would not recommend i go ahead so i was
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:01.440]   going to say like if your phone if you if you're just not getting the life you want or you're jealous
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.360]   of the like the new ones always seem to get this is a great way to spend you know a hundred bucks
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.080]   instead of a thousand and and get really good battery life gardener in our chalom says your video is
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:17.520]   done yes it finally it was like i called it the new night king and i think youtube punished me by
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:25.600]   putting up a wall uh what is what is your video is vector yeah yeah it's vector is the iphone uh
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:31.280]   iphone 11 pro version and in this one i don't talk about like the interfaces i did that all in the
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.760]   iphone 11 review but this is like all the machine learning and the can how all this stuff just works
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:41.440]   uh in the new phone the new night king i want to i want to see this as soon as the show is over i
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:49.520]   shall be watching his video is up at uh imore.com/vector laurie gill your pick of the week
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:58.160]   so around the the time of the iphone event gets very stressful as fun as it is there's a lot to do
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:08.080]   and um i use an app and they have an online version called my noise and it's a um sound generator that
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:16.320]   creates soundscapes but it's more than just listening to a handful of tones you actually can manipulate
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:24.160]   each each sound that that comes from this one soundscape so you can listen to certain tones
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:31.360]   louder than others and it's perfect for any number of different things if you go to the online
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:36.240]   noises section this you can listen to all of the noises available in the online noises section
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:41.920]   without having to spend any extra money on it in the app i think it gives you about a dozen
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:48.400]   that you can listen to for free and if you wanted to donate some money to them um you can uh uh you
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:57.040]   get access to all of the same noises and so they go by um things to listen to to help you go to sleep
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:04.640]   white noise to help you cut out outside sound it'll um there's soundscapes for listening to the sound
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:12.320]   of construction and people go out into this this is the irish coast and i just turned up the waves
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:17.920]   let me turn up the rain.
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:22.240]   Let me get the rumble of the wind.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:27.440]   It's really gonna be a windy day today Rodders.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.920]   This is fun i love this.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.160]   So it is an app.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:38.240]   These are recorded by people who go i follow them on twitter as well and people go out and
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:43.760]   they sit there with these high quality microphones and they capture these sounds it's not computer
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:50.560]   generated audio this is like high quality uh soundscapes that you can manipulate the way and
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:56.320]   one of my favorite andy you're gonna like this one um i believe it's called um Starship
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:03.120]   and it is the sounds it's representative of the sounds that you would hear on the enterprise
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.920]   and it has all of the leaps and blobs but it also.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.920]   Where did they record that?
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.160]   A low hump.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.200]   This is nice this is a Gregorian chance and i could turn up the bell i could turn up
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.920]   cannon a i could turn up the reverb on a or turn it down.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:26.400]   There's um the funny ones for like listening to the there's there's something that will be like um
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.680]   you know the the ghosts within or something like that you can play that for your you know
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:37.920]   Halloween soundtrack or there's one that's a cat purring that you can listen to the sound of a cat
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:43.920]   ring and even adjust the yeah it's a really great and i listen i use it all the time and i actually
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:49.520]   um highly recommend getting the app and and donating a little bit of money to them because
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.280]   what they do is pretty amazing also if anybody has tinnitus um they do have a couple of soundscapes
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:02.080]   that help kind of recalibrate that ringing in your ear so that it's uh helps reduce that when you
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.280]   take your headphones off it's not as bad i use that all the time so i have tinnitus as every as all
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:15.920]   us rock stars do and that's great i can't so there are there's far more available on the app than
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:22.080]   there is in the free website so um yeah there's lots and lots and lots for sure so much that you
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.720]   can't even they and they're constantly adding more and you can't even put it in the same
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:32.480]   and actually they're the first page that you are on um Leo it only showed some of them but there's
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:38.480]   them the online noises section um there's a little tabbed on at the bottom of the page when you click
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.720]   on that that's a lot more is the Starship Enterprise on here too yeah and i don't think it has the
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.920]   word enterprise on it because i don't think they'd be allowed to do that one look at all this so this
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.520]   is kind of just kind of a volunteer effort i guess yeah they're just people who do it for the love
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:02.880]   okay yeah wow what's the one that you were talking about called i think it's called Starship
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:13.680]   it's uh these things are separated by um categories transport spaceship spaceship for sci-fi fans
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.280]   yeah i tried that one i think that might be infra rumble low rumble high rumble
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:26.560]   yeah this is the flutter here's here's the control room here's
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:38.240]   and you can even you close your eyes you can even hear riker hitting on something oh this is so cool
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:46.960]   there's the low rumble this is really amazing you can buy the mazadio files you can listen to
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:53.440]   it on your apple music i mean there's all sorts of stuff to this this is my noise.net this is not
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:50:01.920]   this is this is a big project whatever they're doing here yeah there is a Star Trek ambient
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:11.440]   engine noise generator that you might want to we can we could play with that too depends on which
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:22.240]   engine you're using this is the uh v3 i think look at that oh my goodness all right hit the button
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:30.640]   because it's time to say thank you to our fabulous mac break weekly panel lori gill imore.com anything
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:37.040]   you want to plug not this time go to imore and read rene's reviews and find out all about all the
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.720]   new phones and when the operating systems drop on uh thursday we're gonna have all the guides on
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:49.120]   how to update and all that stuff so come check us out yes thank you lori gill andi and anaco i'm
