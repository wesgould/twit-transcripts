[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, episode 109.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   And the core group is assembled around the virtual table,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.320]   Andy Nocko.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.560]   From beautiful Massachusetts.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.760]   Hi, Andy.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.280]   I'm glad you brought up my core, because I've
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   been working on it.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.080]   Now the bikini scene is finally open.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.520]   It's a shame they're going to be covering it up
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.640]   for the next nine or 10 months.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   But look marvelous from the head on down.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.760]   Those Pilates benches are really working.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.400]   The commercials are absolutely true.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.040]   Till 20 minutes a day, one sensible shake for lunch.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.720]   And you could be living the Andy Nocko technology
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.600]   columnist for Zeke Light, though.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200]   Also here, somebody who is clearly not living that lifestyle.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   Let's do Scott Born.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   Hey.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   It's Fred Scottie.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.120]   I hate a great thing about being fat is you do not
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.520]   have to worry about getting fat.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   Ain't that the truth?
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.400]   Ain't that the truth?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.200]   Great to talk to you up in Gig Haba, Washington.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.520]   I am in Gig Haba.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.160]   And just sitting here playing with my brand new LX3
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.520]   that was delivered by the UPS guy moments ago.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.880]   I'm going to ask you about that in a second.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.960]   But first, let's say hi to Mr. Alex Lindsey
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.120]   from San Francisco, California.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.360]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.200]   Scott got an LX3.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   Yep.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600]   And for the-- for not for my benefit--
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.760]   Too bad, and any better than LX3.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.040]   What is it kept for the initiative and initiative?
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.960]   I know what it is, of course.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   Is it a gas engine device?
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.800]   It is a point cute camera.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.920]   It's a Panasonic Lumix.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yeah, the Lumix.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   The Lumix.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.640]   And it has a 24-- equivalent 24 to 60 millimeter lens,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.920]   which makes it unusual because instead of going long,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.240]   they went wide.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.600]   And instead of jamming a million megapixels in there,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.280]   they kept it around 10 megapixels, which is all you need.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.760]   So that means we'll have a lot lower noise picture.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.000]   And HD video.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760]   Now, those are all the specs we'll find out
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   the proof is in the pudding.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.000]   But it's interesting.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.160]   You like this better than the G10?
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.320]   I don't know yet.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.720]   I potentially--
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.600]   The G10 arrives tomorrow.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.640]   One of the most useful pocket cameras I ever had
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.200]   was a Kodak camera that actually had two lenses.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.360]   So when you zoomed out, it would reach the bottom limit
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.440]   of the main zoom lens.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.120]   But then it would just simply switch to an ultra wide 22
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.200]   millimeter lens.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   And that was my go to-- even when I'd have an SLR with me,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.000]   if I was inside a diner, I wouldn't shoot with the SLR.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.080]   I'd be shooting with that camera because you can go--
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.440]   you can take steps backward.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.320]   But at some point, you just need a wide lens.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.520]   I love the idea of a super wide lens on a pocket camera.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.960]   And I wish more people would do it.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   So 24 is fairly wide.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.160]   Is that as wide as they go on the point and shoots?
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.080]   No, I think there might be a couple just a little bit wider.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.520]   But it's plenty wide enough.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.720]   But it's fast lens.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.040]   It's 2, F2.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   That's what's really cool.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.120]   It's that fast.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.320]   And it's a Leica.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   Now, does that mean anything nowadays when they say
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.960]   Leica glasses something like this?
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.080]   It always means something, baby.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.400]   It's actually Leica.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.920]   It's Leica Leica.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   Don't go cruising the bars in Cambridge
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   with one of them Zeiss lenses, for God's sake.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.320]   They'll laugh.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.920]   Well, there's some bars that are into that.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.560]   But--
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.080]   No, but the Zeiss is what was made
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.320]   by what-- Zuiko or Sony or somebody.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   But they put the Zeiss name on it, right?
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.200]   But they perform at those specs.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.840]   Listen, there's no real bad glass these days.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.600]   That's the good news.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.680]   There are no bad caving in a point and shoot.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   Even in a point and shoot.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.240]   I mean, if it costs you $200 or $300 or more,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.040]   especially if it's $3, $400, $500, I promise you.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.840]   It's going to out--
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.360]   Michael Reichman, who runs a luminous landscape website
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.400]   in check with me.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   He's a great guy.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.160]   He's got a saying.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.960]   I don't know if it's his original saying or not.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.320]   But it's like 98% of all lenses are better than 100%
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.600]   of all photographers.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.880]   So--
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.280]   It ain't the lens, in other words.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.880]   It's the photographer.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   Yeah, when somebody was looking at my Alaska pictures
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.360]   of the grizzly bear and said, man, you
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.520]   must have a really good camera.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.720]   I said, yeah, I got it the same place.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.920]   Shakespeare bought that pen.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.040]   So you'll hear more of this.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   At twippphoto.com, this week in photography show
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.320]   in Scott Bornis is the major domo there.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   The head of that--
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   No, I'm not.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   Alex is the major domo.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   Alex, it's your show.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   I thought it was your show.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   It's a shared domo.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   It's a shared domo.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   I thought it was Scott's show.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   So it's a pixel course show.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.680]   So we're both doing it.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.000]   It's not really one or the other.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.760]   It's something that Scott and I are doing together.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   And it's a great show.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.960]   And I tell you, it couldn't be a better time
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   to talk about cameras.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   I'll tell you.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   It's very exciting.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   Yeah, it's something new every week.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   It's always moving.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   It's always moving.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.320]   Well, let's get to Max, because that's really what it's
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.360]   all about, although I think many Mac experts are very
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.240]   interested in photography.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.480]   But we kind of talk about different things this week anyway,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.160]   because we're going to also talk about stocks.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.520]   The Apple stock price.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.840]   What the heck happened there?
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.080]   It's now now-- as we as we record, it's at 92.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080]   Dive is right.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   Got as well as 89.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   Dive is right.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   Down from 200 bucks.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   That's when you got out.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.880]   And boy, you're looking smart, Scott Born.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.520]   It was a pure accident, trust me.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.320]   Yeah, you were right at the peak.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.280]   I actually missed the peak by a buck.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.920]   But I had to get out because of some legal things, business
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.240]   agreements, et cetera.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.440]   Right now, you're thinking that was a good move?
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.760]   I'm glad it happened.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.200]   So what also happened-- and one of the things that brought the
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.120]   stock down, although I don't know if now you can ascribe it
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.080]   entirely to this rumor-- was CNN has a, quote, citizen
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   journalism site called iReport.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.440]   And apparently, they don't really vet the reports, particularly
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.440]   well on iReport.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.200]   Somebody created an account.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.400]   Within seconds of creating the account was able to post a
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.680]   report saying breathlessly, I'm at the Apple campus right now
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.000]   and I'm seeing Steve Jobs go off in a ambulance.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.360]   He had a heart attack.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.120]   Didn't happen, folks.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.480]   Didn't happen, didn't happen.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.400]   That's the problem is I'm saying it didn't happen.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.560]   But CNN didn't say anything.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.280]   They just put the report up.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.000]   And given that it was on a CNN site, the stock market took
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.560]   it seriously.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.880]   And that really helped the Apple stock tank.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.040]   Took CNN a little while.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.240]   I don't know how long an hour or so to call Apple and find
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.280]   out that it ain't so.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.680]   Now, here's the really interesting side of this.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   Same guy tried to put the same story on Mac rumors.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.120]   The Mac rumors people who have a lot of experience with this
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.000]   kind of crap looked at him, looked at his IP address, said
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.320]   it's a proxy server, said, no way we're publishing that.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.920]   They come out looking pretty darn good compared to the old
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.160]   mainstream media.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.360]   CNN got their leg pulled and the stock market got their
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   toilet flushed.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.160]   Now the SEC right is going and taking a look at this
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.840]   well, it's like a pump and dump.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.200]   It's the opposite, I guess, a short and squirt.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.160]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.240]   Wasn't quite the name I was looking for.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.400]   But right now, they're like hundreds of investors.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.760]   Like, Leo LaPorte said there's a squirting perts.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.240]   I don't know what that is, but it settles.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.160]   It's like, so a squirting perts.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.360]   So pump and dump is-- and this happens all time.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.400]   I get a lot of spam mail and says, oh, you're going to--
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.480]   it's usually about a penny stock.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.600]   This stock is about to take off.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.240]   The idea is everybody will get this spam by the stock and
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.120]   then the guy who's speculating it sells it immediately.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.600]   That's a pump and dump.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.680]   But this would be the opposite.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.240]   You would spread a bad rumor to lower the stock price, which
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.160]   would only work, I guess, if you shorted the stock.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.520]   You can't sell short right now.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.600]   The SEC has stopped.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   No shorting at all.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   I thought it was just on those particular--
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.800]   it's on all shorting.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.600]   I could be wrong.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.720]   At last I heard they were contemplating a complete short
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.560]   sale ban.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.440]   I might be wrong.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   Somebody can correct me.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   But I'm not trying to sell short now anyway.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.880]   But I think that it's always risky to sell short.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.440]   And it's really risky in this wild market because tomorrow
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.760]   the Dow could shoot up 700.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.440]   So the ban on short selling--
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.960]   oh, OK.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.800]   No, you're right.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.360]   On October 1, they extended the ban,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.400]   go through October 8.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.760]   So there was no way for-- was there any way for a guy to
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.520]   capitalize on this rumor?
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.240]   If you can't short?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.720]   No, other than this--
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.000]   a lot of these guys that do this kind of stuff seem to just
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.840]   like to make trouble.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.760]   I'm setting a fire.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.680]   It's just they come and watch the fire engines.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.920]   Well, you could also-- you could go the other way so you
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.520]   could push it down and then jump in and take it in.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.400]   Oh, it could be that.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.120]   It could be he wanted to get a better price on his stock.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.440]   In any event, the SEC, the Securities and Exchange
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.040]   Commission would see that kind of activity.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.240]   They're trying to figure out who did it.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.160]   And CNN is cooperating, of course.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.680]   But CNN may not know if the person was smart enough to
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.920]   really anonymize himself.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.680]   I don't know if they're--
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.480]   How is CNN going to give access to their entire audience
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.360]   to somebody who don't even know that's what I--
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.200]   Is it dumb?
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.320]   Well, I like the citizen journalism idea.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.800]   And by the way, this is maybe the worst fall out of all of this
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.000]   is you're going to see-- is you're seeing all these articles
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.840]   from mainstream media gloatingly saying, oh,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.560]   these citizen journalism is a flop.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.320]   Doesn't work.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.440]   Bad idea.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.000]   Never should have trusted those citizens.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Yeah, but for instance, even on Twitter, there's no way that
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.760]   we just have some guy we never heard of.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.800]   Come on, breathlessly.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.200]   I learned that in radio a long time ago.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.400]   I was doing a radio show on KGO in San Francisco.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.680]   A guy calls in and says, hey, I work at Apple.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.120]   And Gil Emelio is such a blowhard.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.320]   He comes to the lunchroom drunk half the time and starts--
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.560]   And I said, sir, you're full of it.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.720]   Goodbye.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.080]   Even anybody who deals with the public knows, you can smell it.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.880]   There has to be some vetting.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.160]   I mean, there's a relationship between our audience and us.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.520]   That relationship doesn't exist to some third party.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.400]   But if he comes in under our umbrella,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.280]   then he gets the benefit of the doubt.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.760]   And that's what CNN should have thought about.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.120]   They're allowing people to think that he's real.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.560]   And I mean, this could have had major ramifications on the
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.000]   company had it not been rooted out pretty quickly.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   So the short-- so the short was only on financial stocks.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.520]   So you could have shorted Apple and done it.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.880]   And by the way, that ban goes off in tomorrow.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.440]   So stand back.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.080]   Just be ready for two real nasty words if it doesn't work out.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.920]   Margin, call.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.160]   Oh, boy.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.920]   Oh, boy.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.520]   If you ever hear those two words in your life, it's time to say
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.880]   maximum pucker moment.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.760]   Really?
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.200]   So margin calls don't happen all the time.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.960]   Well, margin call means you're short.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.560]   You owe money, and you got to pay it now.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.240]   That's where it's the--
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.600]   Where's the doe, Jack?
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   You owe money as of this second.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.520]   Here's my hand.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.240]   If you ain't got the doe, you're in trouble.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.960]   You know, if you really want to learn this, a fun way
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.320]   to learn it rather than a boring way to learn it,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.520]   go watch the movie Trading Spaces with Eddie Murphy and Dan
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:12.840]   Act.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.200]   Yeah, that's a wonderful movie.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.760]   Because that's what happens to the villains in the end.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.560]   They get a margin call and lose their seats on the down.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.200]   The stock of James is great.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.000]   So the most awesome Jamie Lee Curtis nude scene ever.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.400]   I agree.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.120]   Very fast, but well lit, full frontal.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.400]   Everything you want to say.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   You don't want to see.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.840]   Oh, let's get people listed.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.360]   There aren't people that--
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.440]   Isaac glazing over because we're just talking about stocks
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.840]   and money and--
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   Not anymore.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.040]   No, James Lee Curtis is called Trading Places, not Trading
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.520]   Spaces.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.520]   That's right.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.920]   Let's find out if it's available on iTunes.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.400]   I'm tapping over right now.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.360]   I admit depressing the rewind button once or twice.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.040]   I have to say.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.920]   Just that one scene would definitely
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.240]   be worth the $2.90 rental.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   The pause button.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.400]   It's the pause button.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.680]   No, I was a VCR.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.480]   You don't want to pause it.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   Everything's jiggling.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.360]   Oh, maybe you do.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.840]   So moving along as quickly as we can before we offend
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.200]   the four females remaining listening to the show,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.080]   is this just one more stock question, Scott Warren,
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.080]   Mr. Moneybags?
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.040]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.120]   My money-- I'm Mr. Bags now.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.440]   Empty Moneybags.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.760]   And he's wearing the--
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.320]   Is Apple a bargain in '92?
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.960]   Is it going to come back?
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.880]   It's going to come back.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.680]   I'll never say it's a bargain.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.040]   I mean, I mean, in my opinion, and I'm not giving anybody
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.720]   advice, but in my opinion, looking
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.080]   at the historic track of the company, long term, sure.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.320]   I mean, I got to say, if it goes much lower,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.240]   I haven't owned-- even though it's
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.520]   a popular shot for people to take at me saying,
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.600]   well, I'm on this show because I own Apple stock.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.120]   I haven't for a long time.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.280]   But I may change that if it goes much lower,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.520]   because I just think that, unlike our economy,
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.920]   I think the fundamentals of Apple are sound.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.720]   Now, Apple did warn that it might have a bad quarter this quarter.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.400]   Turns out, maybe that was kind of prescient.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.920]   That's already been priced in.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.720]   That's already in there.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.240]   And do we think that iPod sales will continue at the same clip
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.840]   that Mac sales will continue at the same clip that the iPhone--
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.920]   I don't think you can assume any retail sales are going
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.480]   to continue at the same clip, given the financial condition
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.000]   of the country.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.800]   Although, come Christmas time, if people can get credit,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.640]   I'm sure they'll spend like drunken sailors
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.240]   and worry about how they're going to pay for it later.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.760]   But there's going to, at some point in time,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.320]   whether it's the quarter after Christmas or whatever,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.680]   they're going to see a dip.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.520]   And one of the things people do too like to do, I think,
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   in hard times is treat themselves to small luxuries.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.320]   Maybe an iPod is one of those small luxuries.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.200]   Well, certainly the shuffle.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.360]   If you can buy stock just in the iPod shuffle, I'd be a buyer.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.200]   So the speculation is that Apple has already
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.360]   sold 10 million iPhones for 2008.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.120]   That's pretty remarkable.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.680]   Well, I think it'll be really interesting
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.840]   is if the rest of the computer industry--
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.240]   because we're already seeing trends where
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.840]   the rest of the computer industry is not doing as well.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.240]   And Apple continues to grow.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.320]   I think it's going to show a lot of strength.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.760]   And I think that Apple could.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.160]   I think that there's going to be a lot of people still buying
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   stuff.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   I love the rumor of horses that are going to release something
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.200]   next week.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   Next week.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.040]   Right after our show.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.320]   I've got a check in hand.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.520]   Right after our show.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.520]   I've got a check in hand.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.920]   Is this the famous brick Mac book they're talking about?
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.440]   Man, there's a ton of interest in that thing.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.400]   Scooped out of a brick of aluminum.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.560]   And automated.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.600]   Automated.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.640]   This was connected to--
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.160]   I was reading, and I don't remember
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.640]   where I was reading this, that they were talking about,
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.320]   I guess, next had a factory that ran the entire factory
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.640]   on 13 people or something.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.680]   The whole thing was-- and this was in the early '90s.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.520]   And it's--
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.800]   That's because only 13 people bought next cubes.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.120]   It was easier to do then.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   Well, that was--
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   Go ahead.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.240]   I was just going to say, Eve, I'm
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.080]   wondering if this is a particular part of Steve Jobs's
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.160]   style, because one of the big, big items
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.080]   on the construction of the Macintosh,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.120]   they're very, very proud of this automated fact.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.000]   You could actually--
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.640]   Oh, I think we lost Andy.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.040]   Steve, duh.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.520]   But they-- I remember seeing this big, like, Mac paint
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.360]   graphitire automated, showing adorable little Macintoshs,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.080]   starting with blocks of solid oak at one end
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.680]   and emerging as fully functioning Macs at the other end.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.200]   Well, this is the rumor, and we should get Kevin Rose on to tell
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   us.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.840]   Whether it's going to be really happy.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.240]   This is from 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.360]   And actually, 9 to 5 is not too bad.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.400]   They say October 14th, one week from today.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.920]   So we'll do a late Mac break weekly,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.160]   just to try to catch that announcement.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.400]   Apple will announce the brick, a new Mac book.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.120]   Apple, according to 9 to 5, has created a brand new process
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.560]   to sculpt casings for products out of aircraft grade
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.240]   aluminum using a system that carves the pieces out
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.800]   of a single block of metal using 3D lasers and water jet
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.480]   cutting and Tom Cruise.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.760]   The new technique will supposedly
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.040]   allow for seamless components which require no bending or folding.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   Won't use screws to join together.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.440]   Ultra light, super strong.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.600]   I think we still talk about Tom Cruise, aren't we?
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.960]   He's ultra light.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.080]   If we're going to go a little--
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.920]   How's that going to affect the wireless radio?
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.080]   Well, we've been aluminum for a while on the Mac Pro.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.960]   Well, but not, for instance, not on the air.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.640]   The air's aluminum, isn't it?
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.240]   Are you thinking about titanium instead of aluminum?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.760]   I'm sorry, yeah, I'm titanium.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.600]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.120]   But the aluminum doesn't conduct either.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   You still have to put little ports on them or something, right?
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.640]   How do you--
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.760]   Well, isn't there a plastic area on the air
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.240]   over where the wireless is?
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.200]   I think so.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.120]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.240]   That's what they do with the Mac book Pro, right?
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.480]   There's those little ears.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.640]   But I mean, I, for instance, my MacBook Pro
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.840]   gets far poorer.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.400]   Why far?
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.920]   The MacBook's much better.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.040]   My air gets the best.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.520]   And your air is very good.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.480]   Well, I wonder what they're doing there with the air.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.240]   Maybe they're making the case the antenna.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.440]   Well, isn't the Wi-Fi antenna like a loop around the sides
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.240]   of the screen and the front bezel of the screen
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.040]   is actually plastic?
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.120]   There you go.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.480]   There's a piece of plastic over it.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.400]   I knew there's plastic.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.040]   There you go.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.720]   OK.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.200]   But can you put--
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.280]   I guess you could do the same thing on this
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.520]   if you put it around the screen.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.600]   I'm with Alex.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.360]   I got my checkbook in hand.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   I'm ready.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.080]   I got to say, naming a computer the brick,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.440]   isn't that like naming an airplane the fireball?
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.520]   I think the process is the--
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.840]   It's the second revision.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.480]   You think they'll call it the brick?
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:58.880]   I don't know.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.720]   It's pretty sexy.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.080]   I think you could call it the brick.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.000]   It would be one way of dealing with all those people
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.440]   who are saying Apple's bricking their phones.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.200]   They'll go, yeah, that's good, isn't it?
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.240]   Do we think this will be the end of the MacBook Pro?
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.680]   Well, the rumor is whether they'll unify the whole thing
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   and just say that that's what--
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.080]   that there's not going to be a distinction between the two.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.840]   But it's hard to say.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.040]   I mean, the big thing that I'd be afraid of
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   is if they unify it, if they take away
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.200]   too many of our connectors.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.880]   Yes.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.440]   That's what I like about the MacBook Pro, of course,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.520]   is the--
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.800]   I mean, there's two things that--
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.400]   it's screen real estate and connectors.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.240]   I know my wife was going to get a MacBook,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.800]   and she runs a lot of spreadsheets.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.720]   And so she, after we push back and forth,
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.440]   she ended up with the MacBook Pro,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.200]   just for the extra real estate.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.360]   The screen real estate, yeah.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.560]   And for me, I don't know of a connector
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.880]   that I have on this computer that I don't use every week.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.600]   Well, speaking of bricks, did anybody
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.560]   apply update 2.2 to their Apple TV?
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.840]   Lots of complaints in the Apple discussion board
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.880]   from people who say it won't get past boot.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.520]   Where it actually plays that boot video and that's all.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.200]   You have to restore if you want to get it back.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.120]   Yeah, I'm a big fan of waiting for a little while
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.120]   before I run up.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.240]   I guess on this one, I've hacked the heck out of my Apple TV.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.400]   I've used that Apple Core ATV, so I don't--
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.880]   I don't mock an update ever again.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.360]   Right.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.080]   What does the update even do?
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.960]   It makes it shinier.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.840]   It's a security update.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.520]   This is a bug in Apple TV that could
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.120]   allow a maliciously crafted movie.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.560]   Like maybe, I don't know what, minority report?
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.120]   Trading spaces.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.000]   Trading spaces.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.320]   Edit it down to a bad area.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.960]   Trading places without Jamie Lee.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.440]   Ending up on your phone.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.120]   Without Jamie Lee.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.160]   Some people see it as a feature.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.320]   Some people see it as a bug.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.600]   It's the cable version where they give her a top.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.760]   They lead to an unexpected application
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.040]   termination or arbitrary code execution.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.760]   That does sound like something they need to do.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.680]   But where would you get this maliciously crafted movie
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.560]   file?
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.280]   And how can I get it?
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.400]   And give it to somebody else.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   I'm hearing a lot of pain.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   I haven't heard anything from Apple about what they're doing.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.360]   It has to be really-- I mean, for an Apple TV upgrade,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.280]   I guess I feel like there have to be some big upgrades for me
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.720]   to go through the process.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.240]   It's a pain.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.400]   It's kind of like, it works.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.600]   Well, remember that when 2.0 came out, I don't know about you.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:28.880]   But I did--
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.000]   2.0 had a lot of new features.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.920]   It had a lot of upgrades.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.600]   It had a lot of stuff.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.280]   But if someone just told me there's security feature
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.640]   for my Apple TV, I don't think I'd lift a finger.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.800]   Not going to run and do it.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   Plus, at least when I do an upgrade for my MacBook or even
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.680]   my iPhone, I feel as though I have a certain amount of control
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.640]   over the device.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.480]   I feel as though the worst thing that can happen
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.960]   is that I lose a half hour of my life putting things back
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.840]   the way they were with the Apple TV.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.040]   It really is the only Apple device in my house
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.480]   that feels like an inert appliance,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.000]   rather than something that I can interact with.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.680]   I feel as though if a software update screwed it up,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.840]   I would just have to wait patiently for orders
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   from the mothership saying, OK, a man in a red bow tie
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.880]   will arrive in an Apple logo van and give you a brand new Apple
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.240]   TV.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.680]   And we'll swap it out for you because that's
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.320]   the only thing you can do to it.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.400]   Mean Old Apple is taking a bite out
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.640]   of the logo of the Victoria BC Canadian School of Business
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.440]   technology.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.400]   They have a logo.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.600]   That kind of does look like the Apple logo, even the leaf
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.880]   is tilted the same way.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.080]   Nobody's taken a bite out of it.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.920]   It's an Apple with a VSBT insignia on it.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.440]   Apple's lawyers are saying, cease and desist.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.880]   They've had this logo since 2005.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.320]   But Apple finally got around to saying, eh, eh.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.200]   It probably just showed up like they didn't know it existed
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.680]   until someone pointed it out, coin.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.920]   You know how I was in?
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.320]   I was in?
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.880]   Actually, somebody told me, and I
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.360]   think this is the case that Apple has a full-time staff
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.640]   of people scouring the world for these kinds of things.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.440]   They just surf that looking for apples.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.080]   I bet you, every big company does this,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.640]   looking for trademark infringements.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.040]   This is how you defend your trademark.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.840]   And when they find it, they send out the season assist.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.720]   That's all they do.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.400]   And you have to.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.720]   I mean, it's not just them.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.520]   If you have to defend it, yeah.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.720]   If you don't defend it, then you're basically--
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.400]   it makes it much harder to defend later.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.760]   Scott can tell us all about that.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.320]   Yes.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.760]   It has.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.280]   It's a rule.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.160]   It's just it's absolutely a rule.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.120]   You have no choice.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.720]   If you do not defend your mark, you lose it.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.680]   And I know it really sucks to get that kind of letter.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.800]   And I can see people being outraged about it.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.960]   I'm just a little guy, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.320]   But the way the law is written, if you do not defend your mark,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   you lose it.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.040]   And Apple would be sued by its shareholders.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.400]   Right.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.640]   They have to do this.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.600]   So it's just the part of life.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.880]   And people that don't like it, what they should do
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.600]   is they should work with the legislatures that
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.360]   are involved in this sort of thing
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.880]   and get them to change the law.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.120]   And in fact, this logo does look a lot like the Apple logo.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.080]   I have to say.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.000]   Now, whether or not there would be a real problem is all
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.600]   based on whether or not it's likely to cause confusion.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:04.800]   That's--
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.960]   Well, that's an interesting thing.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.360]   And this is a school.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.680]   But it is a technology school.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.800]   Maybe Apple's--
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.960]   I'd say that's close enough.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.080]   The contention is that maybe the consumer would unwittingly
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.200]   think this was an Apple's school sponsor
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.400]   or somehow run by Apple.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.280]   And that would be enough to--
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.120]   And we hear about this all the time.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.440]   And it's unfortunate.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.680]   But there's a reason that you're supposed to do trademark
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.800]   searches when you come up with names for your company.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.920]   Right.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.480]   As long as we're in court, let's stay in court.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.360]   A federal judge has denied Apple an AT&T's motion
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.680]   to dismiss a class action lawsuit filed last year,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.440]   alleging violations of antitrust and consumer protection laws.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.000]   Remember, last week, they threw out that case about the battery.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.240]   You didn't tell me the battery wasn't replaceable.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.000]   This lawsuit came out after the breaking incident,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.480]   the 1.1.1 update.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.400]   I might be kind of interested in this lawsuit.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.760]   The main point is that Apple's five-year exclusivity
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.120]   agreement with AT&T is the problem.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.960]   Because get this, will you only sign up for a two-year deal
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.560]   with AT&T after the contract's up?
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   You don't have an obligation to AT&T except that your iPhone
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.160]   still will only work with AT&T.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.240]   So there's this kind of crypto five-year requirement.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   Stay with AT&T if you want to use your iPhone.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.800]   But is that different from what you would get from any other carrier?
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.840]   Well, yes, because normally you don't do these five-year
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.520]   exclusivity arrangements.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.920]   They're not without law.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.760]   Maybe I wasn't understanding correctly.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.160]   But from my understanding, it's that--
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.920]   Well, this is their point.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.960]   This is their point.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.600]   OK, so I sign up for an iPhone.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.040]   Two-year deal, AT&T.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.600]   Fine, I agree to that.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.000]   Your three comes along.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.560]   I own the phone free and clear.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.000]   I could cancel the AT&T except I can't because this phone will only
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.320]   work with AT&T for the next three years after that.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.640]   So there's this kind of--
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.160]   I'm kind of bound to this agreement to use AT&T,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.800]   even though I didn't sign anything.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.320]   I don't think, for instance, I don't think
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.760]   if I bought a trio with Verizon, which is CDMA.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.280]   It's not like you can unlock it and use it.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.320]   I don't think that's portable.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.560]   It's not portable or unlockable.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   So the thing is, I'm stuck with Verizon, no matter what,
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.200]   as long as I want to use that trio.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.960]   They have my $300 for life.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.440]   Right.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.000]   Well, the judge thought there was some merit.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.720]   AT&T asked for summary dismissal.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.680]   He said, no.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.040]   We're going to go ahead in this.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.000]   The order also revealed some of the details
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.960]   of the original agreement.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.560]   I'm reading from Ars Technica's Infinite Loop.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.440]   Some of the Chris Forsman writing.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.800]   Some of the original details of the original agreement
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.360]   between Apple and ATT in which Apple agrees to sim lock phones
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.720]   to AT&T to take action.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.120]   This is in the AT&T agreement, to take action
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.560]   to prevent unlocking and refuse to give customers unlock codes
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.960]   to use the phones with other sims,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.920]   even when it is legal to do so.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.800]   Apple also agreed, get this, according to the court documents,
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.760]   not to make a CDMA version of the iPhone that
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.720]   would work on Sprinter Verizon's networks.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.440]   AT&T really put the screws to them.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.480]   It's interesting.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.000]   Apple got-- the original agreement, Apple,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   got a lot out of it, too.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.600]   They were getting money in the back end.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.440]   There still are.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.760]   If you figure they've sold 9 million or so--
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.600]   They're going to be--
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.040]   --reguive phones.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.000]   Now, they get more than $200 per phone from AT&T, I presume.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.520]   Right.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.600]   So I think Apple--
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.720]   I'm sure that AT&T got some good terms in some areas,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   but I think Apple did pretty well, too.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.400]   Also, isn't a ban against creating a CDMA phone
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.640]   kind of like a ban against creating a brown iPhone?
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.240]   Is there a lot of--
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.360]   Can't they still sell as many iPhones
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.880]   they could possibly sell just the worldwide?
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   Yeah, just say--
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.800]   Yeah, you can only do GSM.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.280]   You're right.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.800]   I think the big advantage of the CDMA-- number one--
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.000]   is I think that the EBDO is better.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.720]   I mean, as--
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.400]   That's-- if I'm AT&T, you're right.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.520]   That's why I would say that.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.000]   I don't want to--
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.600]   But EBDO is so fast.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.920]   And so much better than the high speed stuff with GSM.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.760]   We have in the United States anyway,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.320]   for the 3G.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   And in addition, the reason that Verizon makes such a big deal
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.680]   about the fact that they have better coverage
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.800]   is because they do.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.080]   And a large reason--
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.320]   A large reason that they have a better coverage
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.080]   is specifically because they're using CDMA.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.120]   CDMA requires less transponders to cover our larger area.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.760]   And it means that you--
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.960]   they covered-- I mean, I can tell you anecdotally
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.520]   from our office, the only phones that work in our office
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.040]   beyond the windows are CDMA phones.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.640]   Are the Verizon phones?
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.040]   That's why my wife won't get an iPhone,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.080]   is because she just-- she gets better coverage.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.800]   And it's clearly better coverage.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.400]   This isn't like a-- in between.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.520]   So I mean, the CDMA has massive advantages.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.720]   Just wasn't as-- there's only one.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.480]   And I think that-- I think AT&T has actually
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.320]   been experimenting with CDMA.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.200]   And it does depend on where you live.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.280]   There are markets where you can't get Verizon
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.000]   and where the AT&T works fine.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   But clearly, Verizon does have the advantage.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.360]   I don't think AT&T is wildly behind.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.000]   I'm able to use my phone pretty much everywhere I go.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.400]   I was actually surprised at how well it works.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.480]   I didn't expect it to work that well.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   But I do think the 3G coverage is still pretty weak.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.400]   Andy, have you seen any improvement in the Boston area?
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   3G has been a little bit reliable.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.960]   I'm planning to try to benchmark these things
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.080]   because you never know what's interfering with the sort
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.480]   of service that you're getting.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   I have noticed that I'm seeing the little E less often
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.920]   in the past four weeks.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.520]   They're rolling it up fast, yeah.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.720]   I've been spending more time, like a little outside of Boston.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.760]   I moved like about 45 minutes an hour away from where I used
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.560]   to be.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.360]   And now it's getting a G here on the Rhode Island
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.640]   Master's Disorder is a little bit more twitchy than it is now
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.560]   that I've left the Boston metro area.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.200]   But I do think it's getting a little better.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.440]   Listen to what a success the iPhone has been.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.400]   I mean, NPD group put out some stats and research.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.240]   The iPhone now is the second best-selling mobile phone
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.080]   handset, the second best in the US,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.200]   right after the Razer version 3, best-selling smartphone
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.600]   easily.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.760]   But more importantly, from AT&T's point of view,
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.080]   one in three iPhone purchasers switched from another carrier
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.520]   to join AT&T, one in three.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.440]   This is stunning.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.560]   Half, 47% of new AT&T iPhone customers that
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.800]   switched carrier switched from Verizon.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.000]   Oh, god, that's got to hurt.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.680]   24% from T-Mobile, 19% from Sprint.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.800]   Of course, Verizon's the biggest, so they'd get the biggest
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.880]   to Chuck.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.520]   And we have to underline that Apple went to them first.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   You know, ow.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.520]   They turned to Apple down.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.080]   They thought Apple was asking.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   And the guy that made that decision now said,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.720]   like fries with that.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.560]   That's millions of customers they've lost.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.480]   Did they fire that guy, Alex?
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.080]   Yeah, he only went away with $30 million.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.160]   He could have with bonuses.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.600]   He could have gotten 70, but oh, well.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.040]   The other thing to remember is that it's second behind the
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.800]   Razer, and the Razer costs half.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.680]   Well, it's free, basically.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.840]   Most people probably don't even pay for it at all.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.200]   A lot of people said that Apple's predictions of 10 million
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.240]   iPhones were pure crap.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.760]   Hello?
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.800]   It's not just 10 million.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.680]   It's 10 million 3Gs.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.400]   I know, not even including the previous.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.640]   The point is, will all those people now be coming up and
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.160]   saying, I guess I was wrong, I won't be holding my breath.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.080]   I guess I was wrong.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.720]   Well, I think that I noticed.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.520]   You go to an airport.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.960]   Go Alex, go Alex, go.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.760]   And then you, Alex, then Andy.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.040]   The thing that I noticed is that you go to an airport,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.760]   and which is slightly--
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.160]   you know, people have a little bit more money,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.320]   because they're flying everywhere, and so on and so forth.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.840]   But you see the iPhone everywhere.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.480]   You do.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.800]   I am stunned.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.440]   It wasn't that way last time.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.240]   Right.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.120]   You see out everywhere in the Bay Area, you know, where we live,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.600]   you would see them everywhere two years ago or a year ago.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.720]   But now you see them--
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.240]   I mean, everywhere I go, I see them constantly.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.560]   It's almost like the default phone.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:30.840]   We do.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.240]   I do need to point out that Merlin did predict that 700 million
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.000]   iPhones.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.920]   You wrote that down, didn't you?
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.120]   Actually, I got a stash help me remember that.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.960]   But I do remember him saying, we remember
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.480]   when we all gave our predictions.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.360]   What did I say?
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.720]   Does the shash remember that?
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.160]   You sent like 4 million.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.440]   All right, I admit, I'm stunned.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.120]   I did not expect this kind of uptake.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.240]   But what it shows you is really how the market has changed.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.480]   Now, I have to say, I'm very excited.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.560]   And I ordered the new Google G1 phone from T-Mobile, which
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.520]   I'll have in a couple of weeks.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.040]   I'm very excited about it.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.360]   It's going to be really-- it's a really interesting,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.080]   interesting juxtaposition.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.480]   It's what we've talked about all along.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:15.600]   G1 is open to the extreme that you can put anything on it you want.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.440]   They all run in the background.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.800]   A user can script their phone in any way they choose.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.760]   It's got the Amazon Store, which is open and unprotected.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.840]   So this is an example of a completely open free phone
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.520]   versus the uptight, restrictive, our way or the highway iPhone.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.560]   But the upshot of that is that you get a much better user
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.600]   experience.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.520]   And I have a feeling that people are going to go for the better
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.360]   user experience.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.120]   People like me, enthusiasts, might go for the other.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.640]   And you're on both sides of the fence.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.680]   I'm sure you're going to get a G1 for review soon,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.520]   if you don't already have one.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.600]   Supposedly, I'm going to be getting one next week
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.200]   to start playing with.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.520]   And I really think that underscores how you're really
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.880]   nowhere if you're trying to design a phone that's
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.920]   a phone that runs applications.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.240]   You really have to compete by creating an entirely new
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.480]   computing platform.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.320]   That's what Apple did with the iPhone.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.160]   And that's the reason why they're selling so many phones.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.120]   I think that the last year's model was really great.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.720]   It was really cool.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   But it was in many ways just a phone.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.600]   Without applications, you mean?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.920]   Exactly, without applications.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.320]   And although getting 3G and GPS was a good thing for this year,
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.960]   what really transformed the iPhone
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.720]   was the availability of the App Store.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.760]   I think that the development of the Google phone
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.520]   reflects that.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.560]   That is not a phone that, hey, look, it has a GPS app,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.160]   or hey, look, it has a web browser.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.920]   It is a computing platform, of which
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.720]   phone is just one feature.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.520]   Now, I really think Google has their-- or rather,
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.560]   T-Mobile kind of has their work cut out for them,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.760]   because they have to demonstrate that they put as much thought
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.520]   between themselves and Google into the design of this phone
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.640]   and how it all works together that Apple did.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.680]   And that really is a very, very high standard.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.000]   I get lots of these touch-based phones.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.800]   The phones that are Windows Mobile with a layer of iPhone-ish,
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.720]   brown sugar dusted on top of them.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.320]   And it really is-- it almost-- it doesn't fail at the first touch,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.720]   but close.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   The first time I scroll a list--
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.560]   and I have to sort of hold my fingertip,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.600]   because it's not quite--
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.920]   exactly, it's flickering a little bit,
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.480]   and it's not really catching up.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.680]   That's the point where, you know what, if Apple spent 95%
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.960]   of their time making sure that that scroll was perfect,
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.920]   and then saying, everything else is just gravy,
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.040]   we have to make sure that when we say touch,
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.480]   that fingertip to glass interface is absolutely perfect.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.880]   That's what sells the iPhone.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.720]   I think we'll sell the iPhone above the T-Mobile.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.520]   Now, I wasn't able to be there for the unveiling,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.560]   but I hope to get a lot of hands-on with it soon.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.680]   But again, that will be the very first thing.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.880]   But one very cool thing-- they corrected two big mistakes
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.920]   that I think Apple kind of dropped the ball on with the App Store.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.320]   There is going to be a mechanism so that developers can essentially
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.560]   release a free edition or beta--
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.360]   release betas and release demo editions of their software.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.120]   So it no longer costs you purchase price of the software
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.840]   to find out whether or not one of these eight different file
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.720]   uploaders is the one that you want.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.680]   You know, I think there's just two different markets,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.240]   but I think it's become very clear
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.480]   is that the smartphone is the future, and it's not a phone.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.240]   It's a portable computing platform with a phone.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.160]   And I agree with you 100% on that.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.720]   Speaking of iPhone, you think Apple was listening to our show
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   last week?
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.840]   Why do you say that?
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.880]   Something to do with the NDA being changed?
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.440]   Let's talk about that.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.600]   Yeah, we had the developers on.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.880]   We had Austin Meyer of Xplane, Daniel Jalkut of Red Sweater
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.120]   software.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.960]   Daniel's been very outspoken in the past about Apple's NDA
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:48.240]   that prevented iPhone developers not only from not talking
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.080]   before the app comes out, but not even talking
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.560]   after the app comes out.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.040]   The minute we pushed that show, complaining about the NDA,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.880]   Apple released the Renee, and they said, all right,
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.000]   once you release the application, you could talk.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.040]   And developers went, yeah.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.080]   So I think we can take credit for empowering the developer
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   community here at Mac.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.560]   That and the website, effing NDA.com, maybe.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.480]   You know, that site's still up.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:25.000]   I don't know exactly what they plan or not,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.880]   but I think maybe they won their victory.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.440]   So-- and I think everybody did.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.760]   That's a huge story.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.320]   It was kind of ridiculous to me.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.080]   I can't think of a business case to say you can't talk to each
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.800]   other while you're developing apps for our product.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.520]   Apple said, we put the NDA in place
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.400]   because the iPhone OS includes many Apple inventions
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   and innovations we would like to protect, fair enough,
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.480]   and so that others don't steal our work.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.200]   It has happened before.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.880]   Yeah, but they gave that information to everybody
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.920]   that signed the NDA.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.400]   So it's like--
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.440]   $99 bucks, and you're going to have it.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.920]   Right.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.480]   I'm trying to understand what would person A
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.280]   know about it that person B doesn't,
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.240]   that they couldn't talk to each other.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.280]   The good news is they write, however, the NDA
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.920]   has created too much of a burden on developers, authors,
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.320]   and others interested in helping further the iPhone success.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.200]   So we're dropping it for released software.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.680]   That's, I think, very good news.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.000]   Unreleased software and features will remain under NDA
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.440]   until they are released, which pretty much brings it
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.240]   into line with what you would expect from developing software
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.160]   for the Mac platform.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.360]   Yeah, I think that's very, very good news.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.160]   I'm glad they did it.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.640]   And you know what?
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.760]   They've shown an interesting willingness lately
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.440]   to be much more responsive.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.320]   If you look at that, and you look at some of the changes
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.440]   they made to the App Store--
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.000]   Sorry.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.800]   It sounds like they actually are paying attention.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.160]   Yeah, but I wonder if we can think
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.400]   of another 12-month period in which Apple has dropped the ball
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.480]   so thuddingly as they have with so many different things.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.280]   I mean, they haven't really had a need to be quite this
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.640]   contrite before.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.280]   Yeah, really.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.640]   I mean, they really explained.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.840]   Gee, guys.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.240]   We had to do it.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   We didn't want to.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.720]   But I think part of that is being
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.920]   in the middle of an ecosystem.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.320]   I mean, you know, the thing is, is that they're figuring out
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.000]   the process, and I think it's forcing them to--
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.200]   I don't think Apple is being forced to be a little bit more
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.560]   open than what it is used to being, right?
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:26.040]   And so I think that we're dealing with them just trying
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.360]   to figure out how that works.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.280]   Because they didn't want to open up the phone at all.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.840]   It looked like when they released it.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.000]   So they've opened it up, and they don't really
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.400]   have a model for it yet.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   I don't-- well, no.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.920]   I think that was their plan all along.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.840]   I don't think that they had a reasonable expectation
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.520]   that they would serve every single application over the web.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.560]   I just think that just like--
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.240]   I just think that they wanted to make sure
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.440]   that they knew that they were going
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.000]   to create something that was for more than just to-do lists
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.680]   and things that make sense to run alongside a phone.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.720]   I think they're, again, developing a whole platform.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.480]   And they knew that there's a lot of infrastructure that
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.680]   involves getting that right.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.640]   And they had to get it right almost right out of the gate.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.400]   So I know that that was their plan.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:07.760]   Right.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.680]   I think that it's just a matter of wanting to go slowly.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.720]   You know, I mean, I think that's the issue
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.640]   as Apple's trying to-- people want to go fast.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   I mean, I always want to go about twice as fast
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.360]   as what Apple's giving us at any moment.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.120]   So I'm always constantly feeling like I'm
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.000]   chopping it a bit for the next version of Final Cut
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.520]   or the next version of I Life or the next version of the iPhone.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.520]   And I think that-- and I can see so many things
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.600]   that you could do with it.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.840]   And I think that Apple's trying to kind of keep it going
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.080]   in some kind of controlled fashion, which is what they're not
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.360]   going to do with Android, which I think is going to give it
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:41.920]   some--
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.440]   It's wide open.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.280]   --much people hacking with it.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.960]   But I think that there's going to be a whole lot of people
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.520]   in their phones and having all kinds of problems,
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.000]   and then they're going to buy an iPhone.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.160]   Yeah, that's going to be interesting.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.240]   There's going to be a lot of really great, really crappy
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.120]   software for Android.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.000]   I mean, because I do like the idea of someone saying--
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.880]   there being a really good, really rigid set of standards
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.320]   saying, here is the level of quality
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.040]   we expect in terms of a user experience.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.120]   And so I'm skeptical of whether when
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.240]   you give people unlimited control, oftentimes what you get
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.000]   are things like the GIMP, the Open Source Photoshop program
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.040]   where the solution to every user interface problem is, well,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.880]   we'll just add another tool in the palette.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.320]   Well, and I think that the other thing is
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.040]   that I'm not the kind of person, for instance,
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.720]   with my computer, to some degree.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.120]   At least my day-to-day computer.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.960]   Where I don't really want to choose the engine
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.040]   and buy a new carburetor and tune up.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.560]   And there's some people who love to do that.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.800]   And I think that that hand-troID
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.240]   will be really, really good for that.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.160]   But most people, when they want to get into their car,
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.640]   they just want to turn the key.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.960]   And they want it to turn on.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.920]   That's true with phones.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.120]   That's definitely true with phones.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.800]   I don't know if it's true with computers.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.840]   And the problem is, it's hard to say,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.320]   is this a phone, is it a computer?
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.480]   What is it?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.960]   And I was the one that was bitching and moaning
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.800]   because the iPhone was so closed.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   So I'm really looking forward to Android.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.440]   I saw the iPhone as a computer from day one.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.720]   I guess lots of scenarios where someone goes
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.000]   to do that killer demo like you did on the iPhone
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.920]   when you first got it, where you showed scrolling
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.680]   or you showed turning it on the side.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.400]   And they'll do that with the Android phone.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.240]   And I watch this and they'll pick it up
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.560]   and they'll start speaking in English.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.880]   And on the other side, they'll hear,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.720]   "What could I do?
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.040]   "Yeah, do I touch your watch down?"
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.280]   I mean, it's just not gonna work out that well,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.680]   in my opinion, because I mean,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.920]   I'm looking at the existing smartphones
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.200]   that you can do that to everybody I know.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.520]   And I'm talking smart people like Leo Le Porte
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.400]   and Robert Scoble and people that have these fancy phones
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.560]   that say, "Watch this.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   "Oh, it didn't work."
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.600]   But we want to be able to do that though.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.920]   You want to have the right to say,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.120]   "Watch this, it doesn't work."
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.200]   It's interesting when you think about all the different work
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.720]   that Apple did to give resources to developers.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.640]   For the first, just now it's occurred to me
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.040]   that this might actually be a way of protecting
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.520]   the exclusivity of the iPhone,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.320]   because I was talking, I had a briefing just this morning
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:05.560]   on an application that only runs under tire.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.680]   And it's a great app, it really is quite wonderful.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.800]   It's not gonna ship for another week,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.960]   so I can't talk about it.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.920]   But I was thinking, "Well, Jesus, this is a really nice app."
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.680]   And it's one of those things that's obviously
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.080]   a cross-platform sort of thing.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.920]   And I was thinking about doing a Windows version of this,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.960]   and they were saying, "Yeah, we'd love to do that."
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.640]   Unfortunately, all the really cool things we're doing
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.640]   with this application are due to the fact
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.920]   that there's all this core video, core animation,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.200]   when you reorder a visual thing,
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.880]   everything automatically reorganizes itself
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.160]   and shuffles itself around.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.320]   That's also just like a two-line cocoa call.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.120]   So maybe this is part of Apple's strategy,
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.920]   that by getting people excited about developing for the iPhone,
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.440]   now they're developing applications that cannot possibly be,
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.800]   that could not possibly be rewritten for Android
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.120]   or any other operating system,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.920]   without having to say, "Okay, cool.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.200]   "You wanna do an Android version of this?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.320]   "Good luck finding re-read core animation,
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.880]   "and no, you can't have the source code."
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.880]   - Right, right.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.440]   Well, it'd be very interesting to see,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.600]   I think Apple is changing in one respect,
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.440]   according to Nick Sierrale, formerly of Think Secret,
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.200]   he's done a poll, a quick poll of high profile Apple news
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.080]   and rumors sites, he says, "None of them have received
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.000]   "seize into sister quests from Apple in some time."
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.040]   - They're not trying hard enough.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.880]   (laughing)
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.720]   - They're not sewing us.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.000]   - This is your mandate, be more irresponsible,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.880]   make stuff up.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.800]   - Well, I think there's plenty of stuff made up.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.760]   - Your Google stuff.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.600]   - And I think, at least for the last iPod,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.960]   they were certainly telling the truth about things,
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.760]   but Apple has seems to have,
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.720]   now, who knows, but Apple seems to have backed up
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.300]   off a little bit on this really strong penchant for security.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.600]   - Now, you wonder who might have left the company?
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.320]   Oftentimes, that sort of thing is instituted
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.000]   by one person who basically has that as their policy,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.440]   and then they either take another job
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.680]   or they leave for another job someplace else,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.440]   and suddenly it's realized that it's not
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.760]   an Apple corporate policy,
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.200]   but just the personal preference of this one guy,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   or this one woman.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.560]   - Well, you can't deny the benefit Apple's gotten from it.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.840]   I mean, there's so much attention on every Apple announcement,
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.400]   just because, and so much speculation,
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.320]   just because no one knows.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.000]   - I don't know if I'd call it a benefit.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.400]   You'd really, if I'm releasing something
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.160]   that I know is absolutely awesome in three weeks time,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.520]   I don't want some really bad junior design school rejects,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.960]   rate-craced rendering.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.840]   We all saw those, we remember all those really awful
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.720]   mockups of what the iPhone was gonna look like.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.200]   - But that's okay, 'cause everybody looks at them
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.360]   and goes, okay, we know that's bogus.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   - Oh, well, because not everybody knows, says,
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.440]   oh, that's bogus.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.720]   A lot of people say, oh, I'm gonna sell Apple right now.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   I thought I was gonna make a turn some profit
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.400]   with how this thing was, but if all the,
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.720]   for God's sake, it's got a rotary mechanical dial.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   What are they thinking with them?
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.000]   Rotary mechanical dial.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.840]   - Yeah.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.080]   - You think that's not enough of anybody?
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.440]   (laughing)
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.640]   - You know, I think all of us have had those experiences
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.920]   where we show somebody something just as a joke.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.200]   We tend to, actually, even in our, especially in our cases,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.360]   I remember one year I was off to Mac world Expo,
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.400]   I had a really good Windows Mobile PDA,
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   and this was like before the iPhone.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:18.000]   It was all silver, it's not, it wasn't a Johnny Ive-type design,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.720]   but it could look like something that Johnny Ive had thought
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.840]   of and rejected, it was that good.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.000]   And I had it skinned, so that would look like Mac OS X.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.120]   And I forget that in Poland, I'm world famous.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.080]   I mean, there were places in which people will know who I am.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.040]   So as usual, you're at Logan Airport,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.400]   and on the two days before Mac world Expo,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.520]   there's a good chance at least eight people on a flight
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.440]   to San Francisco are headed for Mac world.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   And we're just chatting, I'm just chatting with random guys,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.280]   oh, what's that you got?
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.080]   And I'm just joking, we already established,
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.720]   oh yeah, we're all headed to Mac world.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.040]   I just joke, I'm joking, say, oh yeah,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.000]   it's the new Apple PDA, I'm not supposed to show anybody,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.400]   but I was in Boston shooting this video,
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.800]   said, wow, is that Mac OS X?
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.320]   Yeah, you see you click on the Apple menu,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.840]   and of course some of the menu options are different,
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.560]   because of course, it's a PDA.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.000]   And then I'm just looking at him just like reaching
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.200]   for his phone to try to text something up.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.000]   I realize, oh, wait, he thinks that I'm Andy,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.720]   I'm Andy Anakko, someone who could know what's going on.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.440]   - Possibly actually have the information.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.240]   - And I had a great deal of difficulty explaining to him,
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.520]   no, no, it's Windows Mobile, look, watch it crash,
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.360]   it's Windows Mobile.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.520]   (laughing)
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.560]   But yeah, people don't know that a rotary dial,
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.200]   hey, there's a scroll wheel on the iPod,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   maybe they're on the iPods, maybe they're thinking,
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.120]   hey, what we'll do is teach everybody underneath the age
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.800]   of 26 what a rotary dial is.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.600]   - I have to say, maybe it's wishful thinking,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.760]   I'm giving a lot of credibility to these rumors
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.040]   about the new Mac books, I'm excited about it,
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.120]   and I do think it'll be one week from today.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.840]   I'm gonna check my email before the show ends
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.400]   to see if we get any invitations, but if not,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.600]   and usually I do, if there's an event,
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.120]   if they're not gonna do an event and they slipstream it,
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.360]   what we'll do, I guess, is we'll just wait on Mac break weekly
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.240]   and do the show after they announce it.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.640]   Of course, it'll be really bad if they don't,
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.480]   then what do we do?
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.720]   I don't know.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.160]   - What we do every week is talk about them
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.280]   doing it the following week.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.640]   - And they say, oh, it's an ex-week.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   - It's coming soon, it's coming soon.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.120]   - It's next week.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.000]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with your picks,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.640]   ladies and germs, so get it together,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.720]   pick some good software or hardware, something to promote.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.920]   Before we do, though, I wanna pick a book from audible.com,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.800]   there are great sponsors.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.720]   Audible offers you tens of thousands.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.280]   You know, I gotta get a count because I've been saying 50
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.960]   and I think it's more now.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.400]   Of great audio books, lectures, comedy performances,
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.280]   old time radio shows, yay, even podcasts.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.760]   All for your listening enjoyment,
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.200]   if you like listening, and clearly you do,
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.080]   if you've listened to us,
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   dragble on for the last hour,
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.360]   I know you're gonna love Audible.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.760]   Really great stuff by the best readers in the business.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.720]   Wonderful books.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.840]   Do you have a pick, Andy?
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.360]   Are you reading anything right now
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.200]   that you wanna share with us?
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   - Yes, I do, and it kills me that,
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.240]   the second edition of my iPhone book,
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.840]   the drop deadline was Friday or Saturday.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.720]   And so, it killed me because I got an advanced copy
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.640]   of what's gonna be one of my favorite books of 2008,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.920]   and I was unable to finish it
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.720]   before I had to start working on the book.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.920]   - I hate that.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.800]   - First of all, I was unable to start blogging
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.920]   and bragging about it.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.240]   (laughs)
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.360]   - I got the one.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.120]   - 'Cause I don't care that I'm getting this piece of software
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.480]   that I'm talking about a minute ago.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.680]   I don't care that I have that a week earlier,
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.360]   but the fact that I have the new Neil Gaiman book
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   a couple of weeks before--
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.040]   - Oh, I'm so jealous.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.400]   - Yep.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.840]   - It came out, actually, it's called
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.160]   The Graveyard Book was released on Tuesday,
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.880]   excuse me, a week ago today, on Tuesday.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.760]   And it is one of the most ecumenical,
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.640]   all ages, all interests, Neil Gaiman book,
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.280]   I think it's ever been published.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.720]   I've talked about Neil's books before,
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.440]   that books like American Gods,
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.720]   some of them are so big,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.560]   and they're just so packed with protein,
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.920]   I just have to be in the right sort of frame of mind
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.000]   and really get into it.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.200]   Technically The Graveyard Book is a children's book
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.600]   like Coraline, but as usual,
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.720]   because it's written with such care and such joy,
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.760]   and it's such a great book,
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.640]   it's one of those books you can just read,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.520]   knock it off in a few days,
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.160]   and the premise is wonderful.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.040]   It is about this child who is raised in a graveyard.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.920]   He's orphaned very early,
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.560]   and so the ghost of The Graveyard raised this boy.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.800]   So it's been described as sort of a Neil Gaiman twist
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.960]   on The Jungle Book, you know,
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.160]   how he is raised by the animals of The Jungle.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.720]   Unfortunately, I'm only like four chapters into it,
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.960]   so I can't really talk about how it goes and how it ends,
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.120]   but it's like a pod on the stove.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.280]   I'm always mindful of where I left it
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.480]   and when I can go back to it.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.960]   And as is often the case,
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.080]   a Neil Gaiman book on Audible is read by Neil Gaiman,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.560]   and you're getting someone who is naturally a storyteller.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.800]   They're great writers, they're great novelists,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.200]   Neil Gaiman, even when he's writing is a storyteller.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.240]   And so when he sits behind a microphone
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.240]   and tells his own story,
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.600]   anytime Neil comes out with a audio book,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.360]   that is your next Audible purchase.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.320]   - I am reading Never Wear Right Now, which I'm loving,
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.800]   and I have an Ansey Boys in my shopping cart.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.680]   In fact, you can see that now,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.080]   if you're looking at our video, that's in my shopping cart.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.440]   But I'm gonna add this one too.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.880]   The graveyard book just came out,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.640]   Neil Gaiman's latest.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.720]   He's got to give you Sandman, his stuff is speculative fiction,
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.320]   it is sometimes spooky, always funny.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.640]   He's really, it reminds me a lot of Terry Pratchett
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.440]   and his sense of humor,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.520]   that's just wonderful stuff,
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.480]   or maybe the late great Douglas Adams,
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.920]   the graveyard book, that's your pick of the week.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.720]   Audible.com/Macbreak,
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.520]   I'll get you the book absolutely free.

[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.800]   If you decide not to stick around,
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.000]   the book is yours to keep, but I think you will.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.120]   Put this book at any Audible book or lecture or podcast
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.760]   or anything on your iPod or your iPhone,
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.440]   your Zoom even, your Kindle,
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.200]   your GPS devices, hundreds of devices.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.400]   Great stories, it's fiction, nonfiction,
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.720]   learn, laugh, enjoy.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.520]   I just love it, and I know you will too.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.320]   Audible.com/Macbreak,
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.160]   we thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.480]   Now it's time for our picks of the week, Mr. Scott Bourne.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.480]   I bet you you've got another photography pick,
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.880]   how do I know that?
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.800]   Well, you know, I hate to make you wrong,
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.920]   but I don't disagree with it.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:26.760]   You don't!
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.720]   Well, I mean, I can't pick,
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.000]   there's two things I wanna pick
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.320]   and one I don't know enough about,
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.760]   and one stupid thing doesn't work well enough with the Mac,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.680]   so I'm not gonna pick it.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.960]   LX3 might be my pick next week, who knows?
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:42.120]   But I got a task, a local school asked me
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.920]   to help them put together a budget for computers
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.240]   for their multimedia lab,
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.160]   and they wanted to keep the budget for the speakers
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.560]   to $250 per computer.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.200]   Okay, and I know you're an audio file,
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.600]   you're the guy who turned me on to audio engines, so.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.560]   Yeah, and I would have recommended those,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.840]   but those get a little higher.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.680]   Yep.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.880]   So I had to keep it under $250,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.160]   so I found for $249, the Bose Companion 3.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.160]   I tested them, I ordered a set,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.600]   I put them up against some of the older Bose,
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.160]   and as well as some AdVents and some other speakers,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.960]   and I gotta say, I was kind of shocked how good they were
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   for $250.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.280]   Now, I know what everybody's thinking,
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.480]   if you're a real audio file,
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.560]   you know the old saying,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.840]   "If it has no highs and it has no lows, it must be Bose."
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.960]   But, in this case, for computer audio,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.440]   it is stunning and it's very good for a multimedia system,
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.520]   has a nice big base subwoofer,
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.760]   which many of these systems don't have.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.960]   I miss my old Bose multimedia system, I loved it.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   Yeah, now they're the cheap set,
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.360]   the Companion 2s are only 100 bucks,
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.560]   and you don't get a subwoofer,
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.040]   but you get amazing sound for 100 bucks,
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.320]   but it's been $250, this updated set,
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.560]   the satellite speakers are smaller than the Companion 2s.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.680]   I was gonna say, are they really,
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.440]   these are the new really tiny ones, aren't they?
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.560]   Yeah, they're really tiny, they come on a little stand.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.400]   Right.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.960]   And then there's the big, nice big,
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.000]   booming base that you get.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.840]   And I was just very, very impressed
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.960]   with the overall fidelity.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.520]   So if you wanna inexpensive,
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.440]   this is still inexpensive in my opinion,
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.520]   'cause it's, you know, audio engine is the way to go
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.440]   if you're gonna spend more.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.360]   But if you wanna inexpensive set and you can spend 250,
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.800]   I'd take a long look at the Bose Companion 3.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.360]   Now remember, you wanna get the Series 2.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.040]   This is the newest version,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.480]   and they've done some stuff to improve the frequency response
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.720]   and the signal to noise ratio,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.320]   which is kind of technical, but it's really nice.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.720]   250 bucks, Bose Companion 3 Series 2 is my pick of the week.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.640]   I think a very good pick.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.080]   Thank you, Scott Borne.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.440]   By the way, it's a third of an Alex.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.840]   A third of an Alex, that's right.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.960]   Alex Lindsey, your pick, sir.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.280]   I'm afraid that I have to recommend another iPhone app,
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.920]   'cause I, I, yeah.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.160]   Don't, if you're gonna say the Obama app,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.000]   no.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.840]   I downloaded that.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.680]   I've got that one, I like that one.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.520]   It's pretty good.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.280]   This is really, this is very smart marketing,
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.960]   'cause of course I'm, you know, it's free
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.160]   and you know, it makes you call people.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.320]   It's, I think it's really, I wish,
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.480]   I don't understand why there's no McCain app.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.120]   Well, 'cause he doesn't know how to check his email,
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.960]   so they've been sending him emails about
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.800]   what they should do.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.280]   John, we wanna do this, huh?
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.760]   Yeah, I thought I'd have a crank on the side
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.120]   and a little horn you'd come to.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.800]   No, look, he's got smart off, it is.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.480]   Oh, Marky, it's his radar.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.560]   I think that, he's got smart off.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.720]   I think beyond, whether you agree with Obama or not,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.480]   they really, the people running his online community
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.400]   - Smart and pain are the best in the world
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.560]   at what they do. - They're smart, yeah.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.680]   - You know, anyway, so, but that's not what I'm recommending.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.000]   So I had, I talked about an app that made me very upset
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.080]   a couple weeks ago, which was the maps for Mark.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.360]   You know, and I wanna get schedules,
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.680]   I wanna be able to do it really quickly,
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.840]   I want it to be local, I don't wanna have it go online,
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.080]   I don't, blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.760]   And all I got were stupid maps.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.520]   And so I found one that was a lot less expensive
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.480]   than the Bart ones.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.280]   I'm going to New York tomorrow morning,
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.880]   just for a couple days.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.720]   And then I have to go to Philly in New Mexico.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.560]   But for the time that I'm in New York,
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.480]   I just, you know, I'm tired of carrying the map.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.320]   I'm not in New York enough.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.080]   I know I should remember where the one and the V in the,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.720]   you know, the one and the N and the J and the whatever,
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.080]   all these different subways.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.000]   I mean, it's an incredible subway system
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.280]   and I don't know how to use it.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.920]   And so, there's a new app that I just got
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.360]   that solves a large portion of my problem
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.520]   called iTrans NYC.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:37.000]   And what you can do is it really has a Google map
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.880]   and, or not a Google map, it's its own map
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.720]   and you can zoom in.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.800]   I wish I could zoom in further than I can.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.760]   But it has basically the whole subway map.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.480]   It's the map that you, basically you get
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.560]   when you, when you walk up to the subway
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.440]   and you haven't used it and you grab it
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.760]   and they try to figure out what the heck is going on
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.600]   and what the, and then you have to figure out
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.600]   when the schedule is.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.120]   And usually you don't figure out when the schedule
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.120]   is what you do, you just show up
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.720]   and just hope something shows up.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.760]   And so what this does is you can zoom in,
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.240]   you can look at it, it's nice and sharp.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.880]   And if you click on it and if you hit like,
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.280]   oh, I'm at 6th Avenue and I hit it there,
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.720]   it gives me the schedules for the downtown F,
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.200]   V, uptown F and V, the, you know, the,
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.080]   the Rockaway Parkway L, the 8th Avenue bound L,
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.640]   you know, and it gives me all the schedules
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.560]   for that area and then I can go back.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.720]   And so all of that stuff is there.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.360]   It's a simple application and I just wish that,
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.560]   you know, we'd get more like it
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.760]   because it's just something that, you know,
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.640]   I know that I need as I'm traveling around.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.320]   I wish I had these for all the mass transit.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.280]   I think people would use them more
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:41.120]   if it was easy and on their iPhone to figure it out.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.840]   And I won't use so many taxis.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.240]   So anyway, that's my pick.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.280]   It's I trans NYC and it's a Buck 99.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.720]   It's, which is a lot less than the 1499 that I paid for a photo.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.480]   Not that I'm a bidder.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.400]   - How did that get by?
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.600]   That's just baffles me that that gets by.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.080]   - So all I gotta say is, it was like the first day,
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.040]   you know, it was like it came out
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.280]   and I just started downloading apps.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.000]   I think I spent like 60 bucks the first day
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.760]   of the app store without just, you know, testing my job.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:08.600]   It's my job.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.680]   It's my responsibility to download a bunch of stuff.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.560]   And so I downloaded it and I was left.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   - This is one, sometimes happy, mostly bitter.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.360]   - One thing people are saying that is going to help the,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.720]   the G1, the Google phone is that they,
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.280]   it's a try before you buy as possible.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.000]   They, you know, there really is no way to do that on,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.720]   and they have to do light versions if they're going to do that.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.120]   - Yeah.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.400]   - I'm going to, I'm going to pick something that
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.600]   you can't get that you'll never be able to get again.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.360]   It's gone forever.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.200]   (screams)
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.040]   - I almost did that.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:39.880]   I almost did that.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.720]   I was waiting for it to come up in the news.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.560]   I was going to pick.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.960]   - They've been our financial sectors.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.800]   Is that your pick?
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.640]   - Yeah.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.600]   Yeah, it's all over.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.520]   No, it's a visual hub.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.920]   And I know, I know Alex, it's been a Mac break pick before.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.480]   And so I hope that you listened when we said get it
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.120]   because you can't.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.640]   Tyler Locke for personal reasons,
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.080]   and he's not saying any more about that.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.720]   He's not saying why, but for personal reasons,
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.360]   has decided to close, I squint,
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.840]   visual hub, and audio hub.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.000]   It's all from TechSpanch and that's his company.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.680]   The support forms are there, emails are there,
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.440]   but if you try to update, no go,
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.720]   and there is no download link,
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.480]   and unless you have a friend who will give you a copy of it,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.880]   you can't get this most useful of programs ever again.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.280]   It's the way I convert video.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.040]   You know, Chris Marquart,
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.480]   I gave him a copy of our MPEG-2 video
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.760]   from when he was in studio.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.560]   He couldn't figure out how to open it in anything.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.560]   Visual hub handle it.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.000]   It's just a remarkable program
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.800]   for converting from one format to another.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.480]   I use it all the time, convert for files from my iPod
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.560]   or my Apple TV.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.360]   It's sad that it's gone.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.440]   Now the good news is the underlying technology,
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.440]   the FFmpeg is an open source command line utility.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.200]   In fact, it's what runs handbrake as well.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.360]   So there's no reason somebody can't come along
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.920]   and write a front end to it.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.680]   Or you can't learn how to use it on the command line.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.920]   But it's--
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.600]   - But the front end worked really, really well.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.360]   It was easy to use, it was straightforward,
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.480]   it's really a loss, you know, for us.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.200]   I'm glad that I have it.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.640]   - You should have a good old Irish wake
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.800]   for that application for the commercial version.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.600]   The free version, it was just wonderful.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.920]   - I'll tell you about the problem.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.760]   - I'll tell you.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.320]   - Well, I'll tell you.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.640]   Part of the problem last week,
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   while I was sticking up all night,
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.600]   all night every night,
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.440]   finishing this book,
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.040]   I had a double check every single resource,
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.600]   every single piece of invoice,
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.640]   every single URL, every single price on Wednesday.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.560]   Let's go back and resave that on Wednesday.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.360]   I went to oiskwint.org to make sure,
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.120]   to make sure that both those applications
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:39.920]   were still available,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.640]   instilled the prices that they were at,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.840]   verified it, and of course,
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.040]   why would I even doubt it?
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:44.880]   It's been there for,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.320]   it's been there like with a rock for 14 years.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.400]   We've always re-read.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.880]   Friday, the day after I was able to do anything more to that,
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.000]   oh no, it disappeared.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.440]   And I'm trying to figure out,
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.280]   I'm trying to figure out,
[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.640]   do I call my editor and said,
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.120]   I've got two sentences that says,
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.520]   but if you cannot find it,
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.200]   here's an alternative that you might want to consider.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.040]   - Oh.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.280]   - So there's a bit of hatred for the whole process,
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.480]   but still there's a lot of love.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.680]   There's still that love.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.520]   - Love is there.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.120]   - You have to make a way that,
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.480]   have a drink there, Andi and not go.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.040]   - Hey, love her.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:18.880]   - I don't know.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.800]   - Love it.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.280]   - I can't remember this happening.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.120]   - How did it go?
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:22.960]   - Sorry.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.800]   - Sorry.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   - We should have a wake.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.440]   I can't remember this happening very often
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.560]   in the Mac software world.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.800]   He didn't go up in source.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.000]   He didn't let others take it over.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.480]   That has happened before.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480]   He just closed his doors.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.480]   And I, Tyler, I hope everything's okay for you.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.160]   Sorry to hear that you're doing this.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.280]   And he does at least say,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.520]   here's how to back it up
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.280]   so that you can keep a copy of it.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.680]   'Cause there are some files you might want.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.760]   - And in all seriousness,
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   I'm sure that he did this
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.320]   because there's a choice he made to make his life
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.640]   and for that reason, I respect it.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.480]   - It's for his life.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.320]   - Absolutely.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.160]   - Absolutely.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.000]   - I regret that perspective.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.480]   - It's a free program.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.040]   We're lucky that we had it for as long as we did.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.360]   However.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.560]   - That's the strangest pick of the week
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.840]   we've ever had on this show.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.640]   - It's a program you can't get.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.440]   You'll never be able to get again.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.800]   If you don't have it already, you're out of luck.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.240]   - I guess I just misunderstood the whole concept
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   of the pick of the week.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.080]   (laughing)
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.120]   - But I think it underlines why when we pick something,
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.280]   you should just go get it.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.840]   - You better just go get it right away.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.720]   - Yeah, because you don't know, but it'll still be there.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.080]   - Yeah, but I think it's really truly
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.840]   about reminding people if you've got it to back it up
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   and keep it somewhere safe
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.400]   because there's no way to get it again.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.240]   And I think that's really the point of the pick.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.560]   - Just another reminder.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.360]   If there's something you'll love, tell it you'll love it.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.080]   Give it a, you'll appreciate it for us.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.760]   Heck, almost at any moment.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.120]   - Thank you, Andy, you're not old, not cold.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.000]   - Hold on for a point, I'll let it go.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.080]   - All right, Maliki.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.200]   Or should I say, malarkey.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's just a,
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.040]   it's a kind of a stunning shock.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.600]   And really the shockways went all over the community
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.440]   when it happened.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.000]   Have you heard, have you heard?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.160]   - Yes, just a shocker.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   - All right, your turn finally Andy O'Nato for a pick.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.880]   - I think I'm, I don't, I'm not at the point
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.360]   where I'm annoying the hell out of everybody with that accent,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.760]   but I can see that point from here, so I'm gonna stop
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.560]   and continue with my fake Bostonian accent.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.800]   Actually, my pick dovetails very nicely into that.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.560]   There is, one of the reasons why it was so heartbreaking
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.400]   to lose ice-quint is because there are very few applications
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.240]   that do what it did so very well.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.400]   And so I'm gonna recommend you spend some actual money
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.200]   for something that not only converts videos
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.480]   into iPod-friendly formats, but also does it way, way faster
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.520]   than ice-quinter visual hub did.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.400]   It's from Elgato, it's the Turbo.264 encoder.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.000]   It looks like, it looks, it's a piece of software
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.360]   and a hardware accelerator that looks like a USB thumb drive
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.480]   just sticking into any USB port.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   A lot of, a lot of people, myself included,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.120]   almost never encode things in H.264,
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.880]   simply for the reason that it just takes so freaking long.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.280]   - Would this be faster than using your just your Mac?
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.720]   I mean-- - Oh, way faster.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.760]   I can get speeds. - Really?
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.880]   - I can get speeds of, the top speed that I think
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.680]   I remember is like 18 times one-to-one transcoding.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.640]   - Especially the laptop, right?
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.960]   I mean, if you're using laptops to be, I don't think--
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.320]   - We're, we're, you know, we have such trouble transcoding.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.200]   - And here it takes us all day to transcode H.264 here
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.360]   on a quad Mac Pro.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.520]   Would it be faster than, would it help that?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.560]   - I'm not sure, I've used it on my MacBook.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.280]   I've used it on my iMac.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.760]   And always there's been a just a substantial speedup.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.600]   I haven't had a speedup that was less than three-to-one.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.000]   And like I said, on some of my, some of my opera videos
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.520]   where there's a lot of room for,
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.800]   where there's a lot of move room to go from frame to frame,
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.040]   it can be pretty dramatic.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.400]   It basically means that, I guess the most significant thing
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.480]   I can say is that it makes H.264 transcoding
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.280]   an actual preferable alternative
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.920]   to just going to straight MP4.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.120]   And it's not that expensive.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.800]   You can get it on Amazon for 85 bucks.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.640]   I think it lists for 100 bucks.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.440]   The transcode or software is pretty bare bones.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.720]   It's not like visual hub, which basically put everything
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.640]   at your command and all the options of your command
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.040]   and gave you all those really funny little dialogue boxes
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.840]   letting you know how it's going.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.320]   You just drag a bunch of videos in, click a start button.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.080]   It's that nice Mercedes Benz type or BMW type black
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.000]   and chrome styling on the device, on the application.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.640]   But it works and it's really, really fast.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.000]   Again, it's, it costs you some money,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.080]   but if you spend a lot of time ripping DVDs
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.560]   and then putting them on your iPhone,
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.880]   there will be a point at which you will forget
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.280]   that it costs you 90 bucks and you'll just be thinking,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.000]   Gee, I've got only 25 minutes for I need to leave the house.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   That's just enough time to transcode this movie
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.200]   that I just ripped into an iPhone format.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.120]   - Alex, have you done any tests to see if this would speed up
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.760]   even a quad core?
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.720]   - I haven't tested it against the quad.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.560]   - I can't imagine it would.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.400]   It's got to be what?
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   It's a DSP chip in there, right?
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.600]   - I know that it is.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.720]   I had access to one for a little while
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.800]   and I'm actually going to get one before my next trip.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.760]   - It'd be worth the money if it would even cut an hour
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.000]   off our encodes.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.800]   - Well, I don't think, yeah, as I said, we have,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.960]   'cause we have a couple of octos in here
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.280]   and I know that those run pretty quickly
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.320]   as far as the transcode, but as far as,
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.080]   especially if you're on the road, if you have a laptop,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.720]   if you have an iMac, I'm not sure if it makes much
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.160]   of a difference on the bigger machines,
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.960]   but as I said, all I have are G5s
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.640]   and then we jumped to octos.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.000]   - I guess we're gonna go octo because we had a,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.760]   we have like an hour and a half show,
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.480]   took eight hours to encode to transcode to 264.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.360]   - The other thing that I remember is that beyond this
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.520]   and just to underline, I think that Andy's point is,
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.320]   I think that it's an incredible value for this.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.160]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.640]   - It's the, our machines, the other thing that we speed up
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.320]   as far as compression, just to kind of go off on that
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.520]   and for just a second is that we have very fast drives
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.680]   and also a lot of RAM.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.160]   I'm not sure how much the RAM makes a difference,
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.720]   but remember a lot of the time that you spend
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.200]   compressing is actually, you know, read right.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.680]   And so we just, every octo we have, we throw three drives
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.000]   in and stripe them zero.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.280]   And those we call them scary raids to remind ourselves
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.320]   to take it off, to make sure that we remember that,
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.160]   you have any of those drives go down and we'll lose everything.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.320]   So we don't store anything there,
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.560]   they're literally work drives.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.520]   And, but it's one point, you know, four terabytes
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.480]   or whatever, work drives.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.840]   And so, you know, every machine that we have,
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.040]   all the octos have 10 gigs of RAM, you know,
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:45.040]   1.5 terabytes of RAID 0 and the Radeon 3870 in it,
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.360]   which is not spec from Apple.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.200]   You can't buy it from Apple,
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.040]   but you can buy it directly.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.320]   And those are, they're pretty fast machines.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.600]   But we find they compress very quickly.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.440]   We actually can't press.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.440]   We have to buy one.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.600]   Other than that now.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.560]   Yeah, it's just taken too long.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.480]   Well, if you've got an iMac or a laptop,
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.480]   this sounds like a great choice for under $100,
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.480]   the Elgato Turbo 250.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.520]   I have an Elgato HD 250 on the TV
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:14.400]   and I just, what a great way to turn a Mac mini into a TV.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.320]   Just fantastic.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.960]   They do, they do good stuff.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.240]   Good pick Andy Anaco, thank you, sir.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.040]   My uniform is proud to serve.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.440]   And we are proud to serve all of you, Mac fanatics.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.920]   We're glad you were here today.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.480]   Next week, we hope we'll have our first look at the brick.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.320]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.520]   Who's going to get in line tonight?
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:44.880]   If the show is late, if the next from Apple, the open sore.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.160]   It gets what I got.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.920]   I've got an open sore who wants to see it.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.760]   Oh, geez.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.280]   Oh, I do.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   I do.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.240]   I'm guessing that's not going to be the name.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.440]   I have to get the brick.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.960]   It can be the brick.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.400]   I don't know.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.240]   I think it'd be a good way of co-opting that name
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.520]   and nobody ever use it again for ill.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.000]   Oh, they'll be using it again for ill, but.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.240]   All right, the brick or whatever they call it.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.640]   If we're late, don't you be hating?
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.880]   Because we know it's because we're we're we're getting in line.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.280]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.800]   Another Mac break.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.800]   It's broke.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:34.160]   [Music]
