[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.560]   beautiful Twit Studios in the beautiful East Side, Petaloma sponsored by ACI Learning. Hello,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.400]   everybody, Leo Laport. Here joining us now from left to right, my left, you're right. Mr. Alex
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:19.680]   Lindsey, office hours.global. Hello, Alex. I asked Alex last night. I said, I texted him. I said,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.680]   let's do a mid-journey demo because you're doing these cool images. We were all set to do it.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.360]   Then what happened? It went down. The slash went down. So the mid-journey--
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.000]   The discord's there, but it said, and Discord has this status update. I mean, the mid-journey
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.160]   discord server always has a status update. It'll just tell you what's going on. I went to it really
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.200]   quickly, and it just said, we're having an incident. We will not be able to-- The slashes will not
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.360]   work until the incident has been resolved. I do know that they're actually having an event
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.560]   right now called painting with Peter Morbacher. That must be kind of unfortunate for Peter.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.200]   1,200 people there. There's a lot of people. So the way mid-journey works is for kind of
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.160]   interesting as it uses Discord. You don't have it running on your system. They run a server,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.400]   and it's free for the first few images, and then you have to start paying for it. But you pay for
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:25.440]   the full version or 200 images a month? I paid for the pro version. Otherwise it was adding up.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.360]   I was using it too much. So I paid $48 for the year.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:42.400]   So I paid $500 and then I just have it for a year. But now I have 30 hours of server time,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.120]   and I can do it privately. The way I was using it, it was $50. I was going month to month doing
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.960]   I want to the standard or whatever, which is $30 a month. And then I want to pay another
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.680]   $20 a month to keep it private. I don't want to put it all forth.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.520]   I would pay for that because the only thing I like is you do your slash prompt,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.560]   and then everybody can see what you got. You can pay 20 bucks to not have that be the case.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.080]   So now I'm paying $50 a month, and then I looked at the pro and it was $60 a month. But if I paid
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.840]   for a year, it was $48. And I was like, well, I can pay less than I'm paying now if I pay it all
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.560]   at one time. I don't think mid-journey's going anywhere. So I don't like it as a safe.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.960]   Maybe it did go somewhere though, where you don't know yet.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.400]   Anyway, we'll do it at a later date, although I think we're going to try to get Alex to do it
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.240]   for our Ask the Tech guys show on Sunday because I think that would be kind of cool for the audience
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.520]   there. Andy and I go here from GBH in Baston. Hello, Andrew. Hello. Hello, Leo. I'm so glad to be
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.720]   doing like a show or like a category where I don't have to talk about massive layoffs.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.160]   That's such a fun place for me to be in right now.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.360]   And that would talk about it. We were talking on Sunday about why Apple hasn't had massive
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.960]   layoffs. We'll get to that in a moment. But first, I should introduce Jason Snell, six colors.com.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.080]   The incomparable Jason Snell. Hello. It's good to see you. I'm relieved to be here. This is like
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:16.000]   the end of a long journey of having received a MacBook Pro last week and having this whole
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.520]   thing stretch out of our work all weekend and write your review and then Monday and it posts
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   the review and do a podcast. And then Tuesday, I like I'm crossing the finish line now to be
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.680]   here. And this is like my last download of me and this giant laptop that.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.440]   So let's talk about it. Since you got it in review, here's your video, M2 MacBook Pro
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.600]   and Mac mini Q&A that you did with Dan. So you got both of them.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.760]   Yeah, Dan got the Mac mini and I got the MacBook Pro and we reviewed them. And then
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.000]   yeah, we did a little live video yesterday among the many things going on. And we wrote,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.600]   you know, as we do, we wrote words and put them on the internet.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.040]   There's a way too much stuff to talk about today because Apple also updated iOS and Mac OS
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.080]   to add security key capability. We're going to talk about that later. But let's talk about the,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.240]   let's start with the MacBook Pro. That's the one you have. Tell us about the one that you got.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.840]   Is it the 14 and 16? I have the 16 here. Apple decided knowing that I like small laptops to pull
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.680]   a prank on me and laptop. Which is fine. I mean, the truth is, if you know what the M1
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.920]   MacBook Pros were like, these are those like externally, you couldn't tell the difference
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   between them. It really is a, it's our first Apple Silicon, you know, boring speed bump release,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.400]   right? And not that they're bad. They're remarkable computers. They're just not
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   particularly new. They're just what you expect from last year or from two years ago, I guess,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.800]   except faster. So they, you know, really the story is that it's the M2 Pro chip and the M2
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.360]   Mac chip. And therefore you get, you get more speed and there's more features and there's a higher
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.720]   RAM capacity and there's more memory bandwidth and all of the stuff on the inside. But in terms of
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.640]   like how it looks on the outside and the fact that it's got that beautiful screen and all those
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.560]   ports and support for many external displays, all that stuff is the same more or less. There's a
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.760]   little bit like HDMI port is 2.1 and is much more capable. But mostly, you know, and it goes up to
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.640]   96 gigs of RAM now. So if you want to max this out, you know, if you're Alex Lindsey and you want
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:38.160]   all those GPUs, those 30 odd GPUs and 96 gigs of RAM and whatever else you can do that on either
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   model 14 or the 16. But it's, you know, it's an incremental improvement like Apple does when
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.800]   they're not always doing big leaps. They often are just doing that year by year incremental
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.680]   improvement thing. And that's what these are. So here's your graphs. You have single core geek
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.040]   bench, you multi core geek bench, and you have geek bench GPU plus an X code and final cut
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.800]   bench marks. It's better in every regard, right? I mean, it's not.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:11.920]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, the M2 over M1, just in general, every core is about 16% faster. So you
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.680]   get you get that in the 1900 Jeep bench over 1700 geek bench, because every M2 is on every
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.640]   computer is an M2. Every M1 is an M1 like the the speed of these, no matter what computer it is,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.760]   it basically doesn't vary. They're all about the same. But this one has lots of cores, right? It's
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.440]   got eight performance cores instead of the four that are in the base in the base.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.120]   On the multi on the multi core benchmark, it really is considerably better, even than the M2
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.760]   MacBook Air. Yeah, because you've got faster cores and there are more of them because it's four.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.360]   Also, interesting decision that they made here to do the four efficiency cores, which means that
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.200]   there's always that's how they get the great battery life. I mean, I killed the battery in two
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.120]   and a half hours, but that's because I maxed out the CPU cores. Nobody would actually ever do that.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.000]   So before they have so before they had two efficiency cores. Yeah, yeah,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.560]   efficiency cores performance and exactly right. So four efficiency cores basically means if you're
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.240]   just sitting at your computer, not rendering anything or anything and just sort of thinking,
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.600]   right? Like all the background tasks that happen or very simple tasks, things that are fairly lightweight,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.360]   it's using these low power processors to do that processor course. And it's only when you're
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.440]   really stress test the thing that it spins up the performance cores performance cores are where
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   we get all of these benchmark results, right? They're the ones that say how fast it is. But the truth
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.000]   is most of the time you're not using them. And with with two, if you did a little bit, it would
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.400]   have to kick one of those power hungry things into gear in order to fulfill your need. But with four,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.280]   it's even less that you're going to kick into the performance cores. And that all goes down to
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.480]   battery life, which which matters so much. If you're using one of these laptops, not plugged in,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:59.040]   and that's how they get those amazing, you know, they quote what 22 hours on the 16 inch model
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.440]   of watching a video, which is an artificial test, but they're all artificial. But it's a huge
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.560]   battery and a chip that really is good at saving battery. And so as a result, the battery on life
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   on these things is going to be remarkable. So that's an important point. I mean, if you're
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.040]   looking at raw benchmark scores, that's one thing. But the fact that they've doubled the number of
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.360]   efficiency cores in the M2. For most people in most use cases, except for those high performance
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.560]   cases, that's probably a good thing. Obviously, that's what Apple decided. So we should we should
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:38.640]   improve efficiency. Yeah. I have heard some say that the M2 is really just an interim,
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:46.800]   a stop gap between the M1 and the M3, which will be a three nanometer process, we think,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.080]   the TSMC three nanometer process. And that's where the speed jump is going to be more notable.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.720]   Yeah, it could be that this is a this is just a small step. And then there's also some speculation.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.560]   And I am one of the lead speculators, I guess that they're going to actually leap over the
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.440]   A16 chip that they introduced in last fall, which was not a three nanometer chip, right? It was a,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:17.120]   they called it four, but it's really the new fifth five nanometer process. And when the M series is
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.760]   coming out every year and a half and the A series is coming out every year, it kind of makes you
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.800]   assume that they're going to leap forward at some point. And so that maybe that the M3
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.160]   is using their brand new, you know, late 2023 cores. And who knows what they'll choose to do
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.880]   there? But I think that even, I don't think we're ever going to see that Intel to M1 quantum leap
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   anymore. It's still going to be incremental. But Apple does like throwing in new ingredients from
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.000]   time to time, where you get a big, you know, like there's a new neural engine and or there's a new
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.520]   GPU core or something like that, those things happen to, but this is not nothing dramatic like
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.200]   that. It's really just, it's very much like an iPhone update. You know how we do the iPhone
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.640]   updates every year and it's like, Oh, it's 12% faster. It's 18% faster. That's basically what this is.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:07.920]   It's going from the previous year's iPhone cores to this year's iPhone cores, basically what's happening
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.000]   here. Did Dan go ahead, go ahead. No, I just want you to get in here because this is more for you
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.640]   than anybody else. Yeah, I mean, I think that it's going to be really interesting. I think that
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.560]   the fact that Apple could control their destiny at this point with their chip is a big deal. Like
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.360]   before they've been dependent on the GPUs and the CPUs before we've talked about this in the past,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.200]   have really been something they can't control the speed. They can't control those out. And a lot
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.960]   of times that speed is lag behind, you know, where they want it to be. And they had to just kind of
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   tap dance with the software and try to make things more efficient and they weren't able to build
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.200]   that. So I think that we're going to see that. I also think a lot of the speed upgrades are going
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.960]   to come from developers really following, you know, like, you know, not really taking full
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.520]   advantage of the chips and taking full advantage of the architectures that Apple gives them. And
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.120]   so we're going to keep on seeing big speed bumps. We're seeing things where, Hey, we released a new
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.680]   product and it's six times faster. And what that meant was not that Apple went six times faster.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   It's they they started looking at the code and figuring out what is slowing this down. And if we
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.600]   if we can figure out how to do it inside of the that Apple ecosystem, you know, we can get a lot
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.480]   more performance. Again, that doesn't affect text products, you know, products or it doesn't
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.200]   affect electron style product products. But when you're talking about real in my world, when you're
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.800]   talking about 3D and video and audio, you know, then, you know, being able to do that is going to be
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:33.120]   a big deal. And I still think that not only are they going to have a really good process, but they're
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.640]   going to have a, you know, a lot of processors for the Mac Pro whenever it comes out. Yeah, we
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.720]   are a little delayed right now. But I think that I think it's going to be. Well, that was actually,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.080]   I'm not sure if that's true. Because it didn't german say we're not going to see an ultra
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.120]   M2 ultra or do you think that'll be what we'll see? No, the ultra is the only thing we're going to
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.520]   see. What he said is we're not going to see that quad, whatever, whatever is above ultra.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.120]   Okay. Yeah, exactly. But the ultra, which was introduced in the Mac studio last year as an M1
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.000]   is supposedly the basis of the Mac Pro. It's unclear whether the Mac studio will get
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.600]   a revision as well. But the sounds like that ultra chip is going to be what's in the Mac Pro.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.480]   Okay.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:21.200]   Did Dan like the mini? What did he have to say about that? That seems to me actually in some ways
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.960]   more interesting since it is redesigned. Yeah. And Dan, I talked to Apple, we were like,
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.120]   who's going to review what? And I was like, well, if you got a Mac mini, Dan should review it because
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.600]   Dan's been in the market for a Mac mini is really wanting to look at those. We don't get to keep
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.680]   him, but he has a vested interest in this and has been thinking about it a lot. I think what's
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.160]   interesting first off is that it's not one Mac mini, right? It's two. It's the M2 and the M2 Pro.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.280]   And the M2 Pro is interesting because it's the first time we've seen that that Pro level chip
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.160]   on the desktop. Apple's done it in laptops before, but on the desktop, you either had the
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:06.080]   Max and Ultra on the Mac studio or you had the M1 base chip on the iMac and the Mac mini. And so
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.680]   with this new Mac mini, you get the M2 base level if you want it. And that's the one that's 599,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.080]   which is actually a pretty great price. But for, I think it starts 1299, you get that M2 Pro chip
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.680]   and now you're really, I mean, that's a very impressive system. For anybody who's like,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:30.960]   I need a little bit more than the M2 can offer, the M2 Pro really does open a lot of possibilities
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:36.160]   on that Mac mini. So you've essentially got two kinds of Mac mini now. You've got the kind of base,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.000]   it's enough performance for me. I don't need more. And then without going up to Mac studio level,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.720]   you can get this thing that slides in sort of in between them, which is the M2 Pro mini.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.840]   Yeah, and that's really like when you look at the Mac studio kind of entry level for
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.120]   all intents and purposes, entry level is about 3000 bucks. If you're saying, well, I could spend
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   2000 or or 2200 bucks or somewhere in that range. You know, the, I think that the Mac mini 2 Pro
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.400]   or M2 Pro is really fits, as Jason said, really, really nicely into that into that camp.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   How many did you buy? I've only bought one. So I just want to see it.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.960]   Yeah. No, I'm waiting on some stuff and when the money rolls in, I'm going to buy a bunch more.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.480]   So, no, we haven't ordered one yet. It might show up during the show. I mean,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.720]   we'll get it unboxed. I got the email this morning from Apple that said it's going,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.960]   today is the day, even though it, yeah. So it's supposed to show up today sometime.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.880]   Actually, that's why we didn't order one. John's going to the store today because they are in
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.360]   stuff. Yeah, I got, yeah. I got the base unit that I want to test with zoom ISO specifically to just
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.000]   see what what does eight outputs look like from from that from that product. So, so I'm,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.560]   so that's why I got the eight, the really the most basic one I could get,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.120]   which I was going to buy anyway. So I've saved $100 by by waiting because it was 699 when it was
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.040]   when it was the M1 and it's 599 with the M2, but 775 after you had the Apple care and
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.040]   shipping and taxes. I'm actually, you know, I had, of course, in my card, I had all of the
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   different versions of everything and I actually even ordered a MacBook Pro and then I cancel it
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.120]   almost. I already, last week on the show, you didn't notice, but I was busily tapping away.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.440]   And then I canceled it because I'm going to be the one who waits for the M3, I think.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.280]   I have an M2 MacBook Air. I should be clear. I'm not like, yeah, I'm not like that animal, but I,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:49.760]   I'm not using Intel. Lisa did actually, Lisa did buy and we'll get in a couple of days,
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:57.520]   actually her, I think the 31st, because she did a BTO, her MacBook Air 14, MacBook Pro 14.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.720]   I'm glad Alex mentioned Intel because I think that that's actually the story here. I know that
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.320]   all of us who are so tied into Apple and tech are like, oh, the Intel transition, it's basically
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.680]   over now, which it is. I mean, other than the Mac Pro, the, that high end Mac Mini, they were
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.320]   selling one that was the Intel one from 2018 that kept it in the price list because they knew they
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.760]   needed a model with more ports and more performance. And that's what the M2 Pro model gets them. But
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:30.320]   like realistically, most of the people who will be buying either this Mac Mini or the MacBook Pro
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.760]   are probably going to be people who, you know, they bought a late model Intel laptop. And,
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:42.480]   even though the M1s looked really good, they're like, yeah, but I just bought this laptop. And I,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.880]   and I ended up processor transition, I'm just going to sit it out. I think those people are,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.960]   are going to be in the market for that M2 MacBook Pro. I think there are a lot of people like me
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:57.760]   who've got it like a 2018 Mac Mini who are like, you know, I pass the M1 buy, but then I look at this
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.640]   M2 and I'm like, well, maybe, okay, maybe this is my update update. And I think that's the truth of
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.120]   it, right? Sorry to be a broken record on this. But like, we all get focused on like this year
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.560]   versus last year. But the truth is so many people out there are holding on to a late model Intel
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.200]   MacBook Pro that they spent a lot of money on. And it's only now that I think we're getting to the
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.240]   point where they're going to start looking at this and saying, well, it's not the first generation
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   of the chip transition and things seem to have been smooth. And now they've spent that time,
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.520]   you know, amortizing the cost of that Intel laptop. And now maybe they'll make the jump.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.960]   And if, because if you're on an M1, like, yeah, it's incrementally faster, but unless you will pay,
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:44.640]   you know, any price for any performance boost, your M1 MacBook Pro is going to be great. So
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.840]   really, it's the people coming from Intel. Intel, we should say it's a max, not Intel.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.720]   Intel Max. Yes. Yeah, because they can come to they're welcome. They're welcome. But then a lot
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:01.920]   of them say, I'm not giving up my Intel PC because there are faster chips on in the Intel side,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:08.320]   plus I love Windows, which not for Mintel, but ironically, but yes. Indeed, no, I am saying,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.480]   yeah, if you've got an Intel MacBook Pro or an Intel Mac mini or or honestly, an iMac,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.120]   right, where you might look at the studio display or another third party display and a Mac mini and
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.840]   say maybe that's my replacement. I think I think those are going to be big markets for these products
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.600]   more than it is that incremental M1 to M2 person. That's that's the excuse I gave last week for
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.520]   why Apple's weird comparisons during the video were all to previous like three year old Intel
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:42.400]   Max as opposed to the M1. And then there are many who said, well, that's also because it's the M1
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.280]   comparison is so such a small speed bump. They didn't really want to emphasize in both are true.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.680]   I think they're both true. Yeah. And rubbing it in though to the people who still have an Intel
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.880]   machine like going, it's really a lot faster than what you had now. We just like to remind you that
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.160]   this is the time to move forward. Well, Apple would every, you know, Microsoft did this too.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.000]   They really would like you to be on a modern version of their hardware and software
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.840]   because they want to continue to develop. I mean, I still tell. I have a 20,
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:21.600]   20, 12 Mac mini that I still I'm still using. So like below my M1 Mac mini. And so the thing is,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   is the great thing about these these boxes is there's always things to do with them. And if
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.720]   you're not using them, like I just use them for what they're good for. We never bought,
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.840]   I never bought it expecting it to run, you know, the bench, you know, resolve or cinema 4D. So it's
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.000]   not a it's not that big of a deal. And so these things, if you're depends on what you're doing,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.120]   like the fact that you need to switch from a your current Mac mini or iMac or whatever to
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.920]   something bigger only is only if you're doing something that that will matter. I will say some
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.520]   of the operating stuff works, operating system stuff works better as well. But the thing is,
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:59.200]   is I still think that when people think about these, I mean, my my wife has a bunch of laptops,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.520]   and I have mostly just I have a max studio and a bunch of Mac minis. And when I go over to her
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.560]   desk, I'm always like, the helper was like, I like, yeah, all this screen and this thing. And
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.880]   this is such a clutter. Like, you know, unless you're going to go somewhere, you're going to leave
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.200]   the house. I always feel like, you know, I I'm not a couch person either. I do not like sitting
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.840]   in my laptop with my couch and a couch. And so so I like having having it there. But I think that
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.320]   people should really look at these Mac minis really seriously about like, how much do you really
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.440]   need or want to be going somewhere with it? And even with my studio, I put it in a case and take
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.320]   it to the office like a month. Well, I think that maybe is a good argument for having a MacBook Air
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.440]   and a Mac mini, you know, I I had home, I have an air go test around. I have a I spent a lot
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:48.320]   of my portable, you're just you're a different user, honestly. And Alex, you're I don't sit down
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.520]   on my desk all that often. I have a very nice Mac studio there. It's very fast. But I always have
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.240]   my air with me, you know, because I'm yeah, and I think that I do that. I use I use my iPad for that
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.160]   or my phone mostly to do that. And I have to admit, I do it because I don't want to work all the time.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.560]   When I when I when I walk out of that, when I walk out of my office, I just want it to be like,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.680]   see to me, I left that behind a hobby. My work is talking.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:20.240]   So I don't want to talk when I get home. But I do want to compute. I do want to
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.720]   say that I can always walk into my office and do it. But I again, yeah, that's I spend a lot of
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.320]   time in my office. So it's it's it fills up the time. Yeah, that's so actually one of the questions
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:37.920]   you answer in your review, Jason is if you have a MacBook Air, even even the M1
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.400]   MacBook Air, should you really consider if one of these new MacBook Pros?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   I mean, MacBook Air, I think that there is an argument to be made. I'm a big fan of the
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.680]   MacBook Air that most people don't need a MacBook Pro, right? Like the the M2 Air and even the M1
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.320]   Air are so powerful that you will never I have this thing where I have friends of mine who are
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.880]   buying like a new laptop for their kid who's off a college or whatever and they come ask Jason about
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.960]   it, right? And they're like worried. And I realized that how history kind of sticks with people who
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.840]   are not super technical, they're worried that if they buy the low end, the cheapest model,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.560]   that it's not going to be able to do the job that it's very rapidly going to get slow and be
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.880]   unreliable and not be able to do whatever their kid is going to want to do with it.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:31.280]   And you know, there was a time when that was true, but this, you know, an M1 or M2 MacBook Air,
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:37.760]   it's literally going to do unless your kid is doing like 3D modeling or something, like it is more
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.120]   than 99% of the people need. So the reason you buy a MacBook Pro might be because you're a pro
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.080]   level user and you need lots of RAM or you need lots of GPU. That's absolutely true. But I think
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.920]   the primary reason you buy a MacBook Pro is you want the bigger screen. You want it's a big
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.800]   beautiful screen. It's the best display that Apple has ever made for a Mac. It is the same one that
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.880]   was in the last generation, but it's like it's HDR because it's got the mini LED backlighting.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.280]   It's got all those ports. So it supports multiple displays. If you want to dock to two monitors on
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.480]   your desktop, guess what? MacBook Air can't do that, but the MacBook Pro can. It's got the SD card
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.840]   reader. It's got like, it's got lots of other features other than that it's really, really fast.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.240]   And I think that for a lot of people, that's the reason they get the MacBook Pro is because they
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.880]   want that big beautiful screen, big, better battery and all of those ports with all that flexibility.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.520]   Yeah. So I will sit my two Mac book here next to Lisa's brand new MacBook Pro when it comes 14
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:42.320]   inch and I'll do ahead the head comparison. Maybe it will wow me, but I think for most of us,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:49.280]   I would cancel patience. I think the M3, I mean, there's new screen technologies out there,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.360]   their rumors Apple, it might be looking at OLED. It just might be worse. I mean, holding off the
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.680]   bottom of you have patience. If you can be patient. Yeah, you always buy the computer
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.640]   right before you need it. That's always the best thing is to hold out as long as you can.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.360]   I think that the next natural place to buy it would be middle of June. You know, like that's
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.960]   usually the if you were going to buy something, if you think you can wait, if you can't wait,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.360]   just buy what you need. But if you can wait, usually the next time we see new machines
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.760]   would be sometime before the middle of June, then the chances of seeing something again
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.640]   probably wouldn't be until November. So those are the drops or sometime in the spring or
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.280]   then everything slows down and then there's an iPhone announcement and then you potentially
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.720]   see something at the end of the day. Well, we're probably a year off from an M3. I mean,
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.960]   almost certainly at least a year off from an M3. Yeah. Mark Herman says late this year and I
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.040]   just kind of don't believe it. I think that Apple has seen enough of a delay in everything that
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:49.120]   they've been doing lately that the M3 feels more like a year from now than it does this fall. It
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.000]   would also mean potentially that they were rolling out Mac processors based on the iPhone
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.040]   processor at the same time as the iPhone processor, which, you know, they really haven't done that yet.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.120]   And I don't know if they've got the chip design and chip phabbing bandwidth to fab a whole bunch
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.760]   of iPhone processors at the same time they're going to build the next generation Mac processor.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.560]   I don't know. That's why I wonder if M3 is really more a 2024 kind of story.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:22.240]   Yeah. I'm willing to wait till even June 2024. And I think that'll give them time to do a redesign.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.400]   There might be a newer screen, a better screen. I think there will be a better screen.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.280]   I think if you have any kind of M1 or M2 that's you already bought that's solid,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.200]   I would definitely wait until summer of 2024 before I upgrade it again.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.000]   Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.200]   Yeah. I didn't even want to get the M2, but I spilled as you know, spilled coffee to my M1.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:50.160]   Oh, well, oh, well, these things happen. I got AppleCare Plus this time, or whatever it is.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.520]   Oh, right. Yeah. The guy looked at me. That's actually,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.720]   you don't want to repair this. This is going to cost you more than a new one.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:07.040]   Andy? No, I'm just going to say that's one reason why you shouldn't get yourself locked into one
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.560]   form factor thinking that I've always bought desktops. Why am I considering buying a laptop?
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.880]   Well, for the reasons that you explain that oftentimes you get more re-sided because
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.560]   you don't think that you the only reason why you don't use a Mac outside of your
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.440]   outside of your office is because you can't. But the other reason, but it also works the same way
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:30.720]   in reverse where if you can only afford one computer and you really know what your uses are,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.840]   absolutely a laptop is the best bang for the buck. But you can save a lot of money and maybe
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.320]   get a lot more longevity by getting a desktop simply for the reasons that all that you also
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.120]   mentioned, which is that a desktop, it's safe. Unless it gets stolen, it's on your desk. You have
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.360]   to really put your shoulder into it in order to spill a beverage and take out a desktop.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.000]   And so I think that's the reason why that plus the fact that there are there's no mechanical
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.080]   key switches that I'm dealing with. I'm not plugging things into it and out it all the time.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.760]   That's why I will get 10 years out of a Mac mini and it will still be working like a top
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.040]   by the time I'm ready to retire it. And for that reason, I'm not going to retire it.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:14.400]   Yeah. And I speak, when I say I'm not using a laptop, I use a laptop 80 to 90 percent of the time
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.920]   for 30 years. It's not like I didn't ever do it. I just don't want to do it again.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.320]   Like I just found during COVID, I was like, I do not want to do this ever again. And I got used to
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.200]   not having that and just decided I wouldn't. So, but I still have, you know, my iPad is what I
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.560]   usually use the most. And I take my iPad and my little air laptop when I travel thinking I'm
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.880]   going to use the laptop. And the only thing I use it for is zoom for office hours. Like,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.440]   that's the one thing that I turned it on for a minute. And I put it away and I use the iPad the
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:51.840]   rest of the day. All right. Of course, immediately after we closed the show yesterday, Apple announced
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:30:03.040]   another product. The return of the home pod. And notice that they did a video. They released it
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.680]   with a video. I didn't even watch the video. So the ones it was actually a lot of the video.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.720]   It's like, could you not have done this at the same time? What was the deal with it?
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   Like a three hour delay? I don't understand. Anyway, it's a weird thing to rerelease when they
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   discontinued the $299 home pod full size home pod. The consensus was it's just too expensive,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.040]   didn't sell well. They put all their efforts into the home pod mini. And then lo and behold,
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.480]   all of a sudden, oh, yeah, no, we really liked the home pod. We're going to do another one.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:42.800]   Or is it what's going on? It's not the same. It's new. I think the innards are based on the
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:50.960]   home pod mini. But it's, you know, yeah, because it has a temperature and humidity sensor.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.400]   Yeah, right. And it's using an Apple Watch processor instead of a phone processor. But
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.560]   I they did. They decontested it, right? Like car people say they took some tweeters out of it
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.080]   and all of that. But the price is making it. They're making it cheaper.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.040]   Well, I think that's the thing is that they I think maybe some of the consensus was wrong that
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.200]   Apple actually is kind of happy with that $50 down price point that they were basically selling the
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.120]   old one at before it went away. There's a lot of speculation because there were a bunch of them
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.800]   that failed that maybe Apple realized that they needed to redesign it for it to be cheaper for
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.920]   them to make. And that they had this home strategy where they were coming out with the home pod mini,
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.680]   which has a thread radio and has those sensors in it. And so what they really did is just say,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:38.320]   let's do an update of this thing. So it's presumably cheaper to make and is basically in line technically
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.240]   with the mini as part of our home strategy. So I think those of us looking at the discontinuation
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.360]   of the home pod and saying I think they got it wrong. And they got the price wrong. And it was
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.800]   way too expensive, which is what we all thought, right? It was 400, not 300, right? It was a hundred
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.360]   350. I think it was 350. And now it's 300. But like, I wonder if that wasn't it. And it was that it
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.560]   was not as reliable and that it cost Apple too much to make it. And so now it's back. So I guess
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.200]   that $300 price point, because again, it's a good speaker. I assume this new one's going to sound
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:19.520]   about as good as the existing one, but $600 for a stereo pair is not an impulse buy. Also, though,
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.160]   I got one little Apple marketing theory here, which is, you know, it's what Apple really likes is you
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.200]   get people in for the $99 home pod mini. And then you say, or you could upgrade. Well,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.720]   and a lot of Apple customers do the upgrade. They pay for that upgrade.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.600]   When I and I bought the home pod, the first one, and it's probably in use in my house,
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.480]   maybe six to eight hours a day. Like it is like it's a workhorse. It sits in the kitchen. And
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   it's used all the time by the whole family for everything from mostly music, but other things.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.080]   Timers are probably the things.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.840]   Well, that's just like an Amazon Mac or Google home device. It's just about timer.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.560]   Yeah. So do you listen to music on it?
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.880]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, in a kitchen, it's great. You know, like it sounds great in the kitchen.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   Yeah. And we bought two minis and they ended up in show in like a cupboard somewhere.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.640]   Like they just didn't, they never, they didn't have enough noise. They didn't have enough to
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.920]   fill the room. They didn't have enough noise. They need more noise.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.280]   It was more noise. Clearly. Yeah. They weren't loud enough. That's true.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.000]   They weren't loud enough and they were. And, you know, and I had hoped to,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.360]   you know, I don't understand why the minis don't kind of fit into that kind of atmost thing,
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.200]   where you could put a bunch of speakers around or whatever. But evidently, these,
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.440]   the stereo pairs, at least with the older ones, I was told, are really, really good at,
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.400]   atmost style, you know, converting the atmost to something that sounds surround. I haven't tried
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   it. I mean, I might ironically, you can't pair the old one with a new one. You got to buy two new
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.680]   ones if you want a stereo pair. Yeah, different. Just too bad.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.480]   Because I have, I have a lot, I have two old ones. But, but it kind of, I mean,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.680]   I have to admit that I'm, I'm in the market for some more of those because the little, the
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.120]   minis did not work for me. And so I was just like, well, that's all the speakers I'm going to have.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.480]   We end up using the minis. I have minis everywhere in the house. I think I bought
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.840]   67 or something. So they're everywhere in the house. Yeah.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.160]   Well, I think it's also going to be interesting when we see the tear down of this new hardware,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.440]   that it's the one of the things that was notorious about the old home pod was that
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.160]   you've got to rip it apart in order to fix anything. And not that not that Apple's going to be making
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.560]   anything easier for the user to fix, but they have to fix these things themselves too. So maybe they
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.800]   are trying to part of the part of the reason why they discontinued it was not because they didn't
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.880]   believe in a more expensive home pod, but because they belatedly realized that it wasn't being
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   not being a runaway hit, they should make some adjustments to how they manufacture this so that
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:48.640]   they can make they can continue to make this as a profitable item. It's it's I mean, there's a
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.480]   matter. It's not an upgrade for matter. That would have been a big tip off. But the 16.1, I think,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.680]   I think the recently did an update to the OS so that all home pods can use the matter standard,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.480]   which is absolutely essential. I did see I did read something about spatial audio, but I don't
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.640]   not familiar enough with the older home policy of that one, supported spatial audio as well.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.360]   That's also a firmware update. When I look at the differences that people are reporting about,
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.520]   I see a lot of cues that this is definitely something that's ready for the next five years.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.160]   And when I re-familiarize myself with the old home pod, I can see a lot of red flags that I
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.200]   would need to follow up on to see, Oh, was this one the reasons why they thought they'd be able
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.360]   they'd be able to iterated faster. They thought they'd be selling better, they thought, etc, etc,
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:38.240]   and this is the new one is basically a 2023 adjustment for the global macroeconomic situation.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.640]   Yeah, if you have hardware that's failing under warranty and you have to fix it, I mean, that's
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.560]   painful, right? That you are losing money on those with every time you have to fix it. And I think
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.880]   that some of that was happening. And Andy's absolutely right. I think the irony of a lot of
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   Apple's improvements in terms of repair are people are like, Oh, Apple's getting with the
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.360]   program about making things more repairable. And I think we all forget that the number the
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.880]   company the largest company that has to repair Apple products is Apple. And when they do it under
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.400]   warranty, you know, they're the ones who have to pay and it hurts the product profit margin. So
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.040]   Apple is motivated to make those repairs as cheap and easy as possible to. And yeah, I do wonder if
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.600]   maybe the true story of that original home pod is more about its high price low margins and a
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:29.120]   fail, you know, a failure, a product failure that Apple had to keep fixing that made it even less
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.200]   profitable and that they've redesigned this one. We'll see how it goes. When you say failure is
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.760]   doing a physical failure like a yeah, like a like a lemon almost a lot of a lot of talk about
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.240]   like a capacitor or something in them that would blow. So even after not necessarily under warranty,
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.840]   I think some of them did blow under warranty. We never had a problem with either of ours.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.160]   I haven't had a problem with mine, but I have had friends who have had and who knows if it's
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.760]   about the power in their houses or if it's about their environment. But I've heard of a lot of people
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.720]   who over the last, especially in the last year or so. And keep in mind, this is not that old a product
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.920]   where that where it's just either dying or becoming completely like unreliable and rebooting and all
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.240]   of that. And it's like, it's not, it's not great. You could see why Apple might have said, look,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.560]   we need to make changes for matter and we need to make changes for, you know, on the processor.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.640]   This is the wrong processor to have in here. It's also maybe possible that they didn't want that
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.120]   iPhone processor that was in that thing to continue to be made, right? They were running out of them
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.200]   and they're like, can we make this? Because now it's using an Apple Watch processor, which they've
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.800]   got probably lots of for cheap. And that makes the product more profitable for them too.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:37.600]   So I guess the only real question is, how does it sound? Has anybody reviewed the sound yet? Are they
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.680]   arriving today? No, some journalists got to go to a room that they couldn't describe and describe
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:48.320]   what they heard there, which is exactly what they did at WWDC when they launched the original one.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:53.840]   I was taken into a room that I couldn't describe. It's so weird, but now they're going to be shipping.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.400]   And so we'll get some legitimate honest real questions. If they can make them for less
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.640]   and make it more capable and matter and all of that, and it still sounds as good. Because that
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:10.400]   was one thing they really touted on that original HomePod is we have we have figured out a way.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.680]   Now you said they're fewer tweeters? Yeah, I think they're three fewer or something tweeters.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.280]   They had a ridiculous number in the open original. It was what not.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.000]   Yeah, I get the sense that they asked the designers to tone it down a little this time, right? Like,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.920]   look, we need this to be cheaper. You can't have all those tweeters in there, make it work.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:36.560]   It had a remarkable number of drivers for a device of that size. That's just not done typically.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.320]   Doesn't make it sound better necessarily because there are limitations of physics
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.680]   of that enclosure and the size overall. But that's good that they had that many drivers.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.880]   Yeah, maybe they didn't need them.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:56.560]   Yeah, I think that's right on the point. Audio is audio hardware is famous for doubling the cost
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:02.160]   of something to make it sound 5% better. And so there really is an upper limit to how much you can
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:07.440]   put into a speaker or anything before. It's something that most people are going to appreciate.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   And given how much money and how much marketing PR they've put into computational audio,
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.520]   they shouldn't be saying, "Oh my God, we managed to put 18 more tweeters and something called
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:26.480]   a Twiffer of our own design to capture specific frequencies." They should basically be saying that
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.160]   we have very, very, not necessarily, we have very ordinary hardware. But the magic of this
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.840]   audio grapefruit that we're selling you is that we use computing power inside there to
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.480]   understand what environment is being placed in and to shape the audio to make sure it gives you
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.280]   the optimal placement. That's something the HomePod meeting did not do, but the original HomePod
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.760]   did. And supposedly the new one does as well. Is that room sensing? It also has five horn-loaded
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:00.240]   beam-forming tweeter arrays, four far-field beam-forming microphones, and it supports spatial audio,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.440]   which is interesting because with one speaker, you can get spatial audio. I guess you can.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.600]   Yeah, because I can calculate those things. Obviously the spatial audio I think works better
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:17.040]   with too. I have talked to some folks that have had both a discrete sound system and the speakers,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:23.200]   and they said it was a solid 85, 90% of the quality of the speaker. It's a pretty good
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   e-lack bookshelf speakers for roughly the same. It could be a little more. And they're legendary
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:37.440]   for their quality. Andrew Jones designed. He's considered one of the legends and speaker design.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   So it'd be interesting to compare them, but I don't know if it's worth 600 bucks to compare.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.960]   I don't know if I want to buy two of them. Of course, I did buy the AirPods Max, which was $550.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:53.120]   So maybe I'm stupid enough to buy those. One of the things it'll do is pair
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.760]   with your Apple TV for a home theater experience.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.200]   Yeah, it'll even do ER. So theoretically, if you have other things going into the TV,
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.000]   it will go back out to the Apple TV and then wirelessly deliver those to the HomePods.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.720]   That's nice. And I've heard, I think, depending on your use case, that can be perfect or it can
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.080]   be bad. It really depends on if you need ultra low latency for gaming. It's probably not for you,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.240]   but in terms of just having it attached to a cable box or something, it's probably okay.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   That's really something to think about. Part of the value of a lot of these wireless speakers,
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:35.840]   Apple's, Google's, whatever, is that you can buy an inexpensive $99 speaker and you have,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.240]   okay, this is my smart speaker and this is something to give me a little bit of audio in the kitchen.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.000]   And then you buy another $99 speaker and you compare those as stereo, which gives you much,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.920]   much better environment. And then maybe you buy a couple of more and now you find that instead
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.880]   of having to crank up the audio to really appreciate the music, like in the bedroom or the living room,
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.680]   you can enjoy it at a lower volume and it still sounds much better. So it's a really good investment.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:07.440]   If I had $1,000 to spend on speakers starting from zero, I'm not sure that I buy a pair of
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.880]   like $800 speakers. I think I would buy as many decent inexpensive speakers that work with each
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:18.480]   other as possible. Interesting. Yeah, we have, so in the bedroom, we have two HomePod minis,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.080]   one on Lisa said, one on mine and we listen to music and books, mostly books on there.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:31.280]   That seems like that would be a good replacement for those. The cats step on the top all the time,
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:38.400]   so I have to have them upside down. That's another test. So you put those little,
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.720]   you put a review of these things should include like your pictures of a flier camera,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.000]   see that no, don't worry, the top of it is not warm enough to attract kitties.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.720]   They just put those little spikes up that they do for pigeons. You put one on top of it.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.440]   Pigeons spikes on the top. It's almost as if the cats know that if they tap it with their paw,
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:04.000]   it will start blaring music in the middle of the night. It's like maybe they have figured this out.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.280]   Massive aggressive, massive aggressive cats. You know, cats really are.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.120]   So I have the minis turned on right now, so they can't do that. Now, that's not going to
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.840]   ruin the sound of a mini, but I don't want to spend 600 bucks on fancy speakers and turn them
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.880]   upside down and have not sound good. I guess it would figure out, oh, I'm upside down.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.120]   And what I don't know what to do about it. I don't know.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.080]   I think it's driving. It's got the more the bass drivers there though,
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.760]   that are in the base and they're going to be driving, trying to drive up into the air,
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:41.120]   and that's not going to be. I need a kitty solution. If anybody has one, I think that's a
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.640]   good one. Maybe we could sell this on Amazon, Alex, this little kitty spikes
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   that just kind of fit in that circle, but then you might actually hit it. So that's not good.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.720]   It's like a little mat before you go to bed, just throw it on top and then look.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.160]   Okay. Yeah, but that's, yeah.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:02.480]   We have the nerf, the nerf for our cat. We have the nerf
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.320]   spray, spray gun. Yeah, you got to spray it. But I'm not going to spray the speaker.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   It's funny though, is that the cat now just knows what the nerf gun, what the gun looks like.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.520]   So anytime you pull it out to discipline the cat for carrying apart the furniture,
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.160]   it just runs away. But if you don't have the gun, you can't say anything. It doesn't care
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.920]   anymore. If you order today, it won't even come in time for Valentine's Day. They must be doing
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:32.880]   quite well, pushing these. Oh, yeah. It was when it first came out, it was like early,
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.160]   first week of February. So it's definitely, or they made 10, we don't know.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.120]   It's such a surprise. I mean, I can't think of another time that Apple has
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.240]   discontinued a product and brought it back in essentially the same form. That's just unheard of.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.320]   It's a very odd thing. I think they fixed. I think they backed up and they, I think they thought
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.360]   they had something people wanted. They were just a little too expensive and it wasn't working.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.320]   So they just said, well, it's not selling anymore. These, this is expensive.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:05.920]   And I think that's probably a good indication of how poorly it was selling that they were,
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.000]   they are easily able to completely run out of stock. That wasn't, it wasn't worth it to do
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.680]   another production run based if they were thinking about doing it again, doing a revamp in a year or
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.640]   two. So it's like, otherwise they would have said, you know what, we'll keep this on the list and we'll
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.720]   say, well, we'll have one of those little videos that says car customers love the original HomePod
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.560]   and we've made it even better.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:38.080]   All right. So anything else to say about the new, go ahead. I'm sorry, Andy, go ahead.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.200]   Oh, no, I was just saying I bookmarked something that I came across last week because I thought
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.480]   it was curious that someone on Reddit had a posted about how they saw their cat
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:54.000]   walked up to the HomePod, meowed at it and Siri said, sure, here is some music for you. And then
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.200]   the cat just perched on the window all listening to garbage and Elliot Smith. I saw that. I saw that
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.320]   post and I said, it's funny. Except for the Elliot Smith part.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:11.440]   But I was wondering like, how does that go into testing that saying, A, they have to make sure they
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:18.320]   reject anything that's not supposed to not intended to be a command. And B, is it possible if they're
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.720]   thinking, you know what, if the cat wants to meow at a HomePod, we think that's adorable. We should
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.480]   make that feature. We should make it play some Elliot Smith. Also, is there somebody Apple music
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   whose job it is to produce like music playlists for cats? If a cat asks for music, here is a playlist
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.280]   to give it. I probably Rosemary Orchard has figured out how to catproof her HomePods. She
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:45.920]   demonstrated it this morning on iOS today. So I'm just going to have to watch that episode of iOS
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:51.040]   today. Scooter X said you can disable the touch on the top. I never even saw it at that. Maybe
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:47:00.000]   that's all it takes is just disabling the touch. I'll get back to you. Let's see. Apple has,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:10.160]   according to German postponed the fancy AR VR mixed reality glasses and plans instead to chip
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:16.000]   a cheaper mixed reality headset with a battery pack that goes in your pocket.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:28.720]   Is this so it's interesting because Microsoft fired basically its entire mixed reality teams,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:36.240]   all of its teams. Meta seems to be maybe pedaling backwards a little bit on this.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.720]   Is Apple following suit and back pedaling a little bit on its investment?
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:48.640]   Microsoft basically saying they're not going to build Hollens hardware when they can just use
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.560]   Meta's hardware instead, right? And Apple's hardware presumably, which I think is an interesting
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:48:01.040]   angle and smart on the Microsoft of the Nadella era. Apple, what's happening here is two things.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.600]   One is they've always had, I think the rumors have been all along, that they've got a cheaper
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.760]   version coming. And that's what Mark German's reporting on is that they are going to have this,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.600]   there's going to be Apple reality pro and then there's going to be Apple reality one.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.720]   And that's going to be the cheaper version that's going to be available in a year after the first
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.640]   version. Makes you wonder of what they're going to say is very much like, well, this version is
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:29.360]   for explorers and developers. But we're believers in this category and soon we'll have something
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:36.400]   else. Don't ask us what, but something. The losing, pushing back the glasses thing,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.840]   I don't know, that product, I can't read that as anything other than this technology just
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.440]   didn't work yet, right? Because you're talking about something you can wear like glasses and
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.160]   overlay information on it and have it be in your field of vision and have it not be cumbersome that
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.600]   you would wear outside and interacting with people in the world. And I think that's the
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:59.760]   aspirational goal of everybody in the AR VR field. But I'm not surprised at all that Apple looked
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.400]   at it and said, can we realistically make this product and said, no, we can't. I don't think
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.480]   the tech exists for it. I think they still have to invent the tech to make it work.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:15.360]   So let's let me be clear. I'll read what he says because it's there's some nuance here.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.320]   They are still planning to release a mixed reality headset and they're planning to do it this year.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:25.600]   Again, rumor only, this is German, but an even more important follow up product,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:32.160]   lightweight augmented reality glasses has been postponed due to technical challenges.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:39.120]   So instead, Apple will follow up with a lower cost version of the, we are thinking the rumor is
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   $3,500 mixed reality headset for this year. That'll be developer edition or stupid,
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.920]   you know, Apple fan edition. Stupid is the wrong word devoted. Sorry. What did I say stupid?
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.120]   Devoted Apple.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.720]   Enthusi, enthusiast edition.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.400]   Because I'm going to buy one. So, you know, obviously,
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.000]   I just I want to, it's not instead, right? Like, I think the the glasses that you wear out that are
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.720]   the AR glasses are out there as a future thing that they want to go to. They want to do it,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:14.080]   but they can't, but they can't. But this this low end VR product or lower end VR product is not
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.720]   instead of that, right? Like that that's part of their VR product strategy is to follow up their
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.280]   super expensive model that may be coming this year with one that people might actually buy.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   And that would be as soon as he says 2024 or 2025.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:33.040]   They soften us up with the $3,000 one so that when they come out with a $1,500 one, we thank them
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:40.560]   for it. Right. Right. Oh, thank you. So, so basically it's the Lisa edition.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.920]   Yeah. 40 years later. Yeah. What a relief. Yeah. And I think that I think that we'll see
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:52.000]   they're targeting the rumor is they're targeting a million units. They'll sell at least that,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.680]   you know, like they'll, they'll, I guess is they'll probably sell five to 10. Oh, they'll sell out.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:01.120]   Yeah. Because there's a lot of people like me and you. I wouldn't buy it if I were a private
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:06.080]   citizen, but I think it's, you know, in order for us to cover this time, kind of keep an eye on it.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.000]   Yeah. I mean, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to overstate how impossible this goal is. I mean,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.760]   Jason's absolutely right. Like for, for, with today's technology,
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:23.040]   getting, how do you, how do you get enough power into the headset to make it work? How do you get
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.600]   displays that are good enough that you're going to be able to tolerate it for more than a couple
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.960]   of hours? How can you make it light enough that people are going to want it to put on their heads?
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.200]   How are you going to have displays that work outside as opposed to inside an office environment?
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.360]   And even when you solve all of those, you're still dealing with what kind of apps, what kind of,
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:45.600]   what kind of functions are going to appeal to people that would want to have this helmet or
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:51.360]   this, these, these goggles outside of these few niche areas in which very few companies have had
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:56.320]   some kind of success. So it's exciting. I want to take a little break. And when we come back,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:05.360]   we'll talk about the new releases, new operating systems for everything. And I mean, besides some
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.200]   security fixes, stuff, the really important details of this particular release, what it will do.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.640]   But first a word from our sponsor, Mac Break Weekly brought to you this week by Melissa,
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:24.160]   a leading, I'd say the leading provider of global data quality, identity verification and address
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.280]   management solutions. Today, they just announced this is exciting, a partnership with Tom Tom.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:37.120]   You know Tom Tom, the satellite navigation product. They're going to layer Tom Tom's
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:43.280]   comprehensive global address data, location data and country data on top of Melissa's already
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.240]   industry leading data quality enrichment and identity verification solutions. This is just one
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:54.320]   more way. Melissa is always doing this. They are improving their products. They've been doing this
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:01.760]   for so long since 1985. And every year, something new comes along from Melissa that makes it even
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:08.640]   better. This Tom Tom partnership is huge multi language, multi format support key to postal
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:15.120]   addressing. Not every country is alike. Tom Tom and Jess country data into one global. And this
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.760]   is important standardized data set while supporting multiple languages. You know, there's no
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:28.000]   street addresses in Venice. You just turn left at the canal and then right and then go down an alley
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.480]   and you'll find it. Well, Tom Tom actually can ingest that and give you a location.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:38.560]   They handle those weird nuances country by country, making the Melissa solutions to
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:43.360]   act efficient and seamless and making sure your customer data is actually useful and effective.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:51.840]   Melissa has actually used this to increase its global support across 240 countries and territories.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:56.320]   We talked to Greg Brown. He's the vice president of global marketing. Melissa says,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:02.000]   by adding Tom Tom's rooftop precision capabilities to our solutions. Melissa's customers can rest
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.160]   assured not only is their data clean and verified, but they have pinpoint accurate location information
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.920]   high value to business operations. This ensures restaurants are found packages are delivered to
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   the right place. On demand drivers find their passengers and so much more. You can see how important
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:27.280]   global address verification is location information is poor data quality could cost organizations on
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   average 15 million a year. And that's just the first year. The longer it stays in your system,
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:40.640]   the more your business losses will accumulate by leveraging Tom Tom maps plus points of interest
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.840]   plus seven digit postal codes plus address points and their routing API. It's kind of amazing.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.320]   Melissa provides a best of breed address engine critical to business needs worldwide. And what's
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:58.240]   cool about it is you can get it any way you want it on Prem as a SaaS delivery. They have a secure
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.920]   FTP server. You can upload and download to and from or probably the way most of you will use it as
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:09.600]   an API. They have a very nice API, which means you can include this valuable additional information
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:16.640]   into your app into your customer service app or your shopping cart. Melissa's been doing this
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.160]   longer than anybody else since 1985. They specialize in global intelligence solutions
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:29.440]   to help organizations unlock accurate data for a more compelling customer view. And I probably
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   goes without saying but I'm going to say it because it's so important. Melissa treats your data
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:38.640]   as you would want it to be treated. They undergo continuous independent security audits.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:45.680]   They are absolutely committed to data security, privacy and compliance. There's SOC 2, HIPAA
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:51.520]   and GDPR compliant. Your data is in the best possible hands. So many ways to use Melissa,
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:57.360]   I want you to check it out. Get started today. If you want to play with the API with 1000 records
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:05.520]   clean for free, Melissa dot com slash Twitch, M E L I S S A dot com slash Twitter. I'm so
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:11.280]   happy we've partnered with them for several years now. It's so cool because they have become
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.880]   even in the short time we've been working with them. I think it's three years better and better
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:22.800]   and better and better. Melissa dot com slash twit. We're so glad they support us here at
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:28.160]   Twit. We glad you support us at Twit by using that address. Melissa dot com slash
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:39.920]   Twit. Thank you, Melissa. So iOS 16.3. Ventura. What is it? I don't even know 11.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:47.200]   I don't know what it is. It's all 13.13. You don't know either, do you?
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.720]   Just one, two? I don't know. Which one are you talking about? It's all new, baby. It's all new.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.920]   In fact, even if you have older versions of its Mac OS Ventura 13, too,
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:04.880]   but older versions are getting updated of iOS and Mac OS. iPad OS is also updated to 16.3.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:11.760]   According to Apple's website, these are fixing security exploits, including patches in Apple
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:21.120]   mobile file integrity, image, I O kernel, mail, maps, Safari and WebKit. Whoa. There's, for instance,
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:27.920]   there's nine to five Mac found a exploit in the weather app that could allow other apps to bypass
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:34.240]   privacy preferences, another exploit in WebKit, which is, of course, what Safari and all browsers
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:40.160]   use in iOS. Two exploits it could lead to, and this is bad, arbitrary execution of malicious code.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:50.720]   But the biggest thing I think end users will notice is support for security keys. This is very
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:58.560]   interesting. You can now use your UBI key, for instance, to log into your iOS or Mac device,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:06.640]   or to provide two factor. Instead of the six digit code that Apple pushes, you could use a key to
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:13.600]   do that. Apple has a post about this, about how to use it. It's probably worth reading if you're
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:26.480]   interested in doing that. It's a HT-21-3154. Hot. And they talk about which security keys they
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:33.600]   support and all of that. So I like this. I mean, I use a UBI key for two factor on my
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:39.920]   password manager and a few other things. I think this is an interesting thing. Will any of you
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.800]   use that instead of the normal--
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.520]   Probably get it.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.240]   Yeah. I think for you especially, Alex. Yeah.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.200]   You, they were--
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.480]   We're not as F.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.760]   Yeah, we're not high value targets.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.520]   Right. But Alex.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.320]   And Alex is definitely--
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.160]   Yeah. He's in their crosshairs.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:06.240]   You do have to have at least two FIDO-certified security keys. UBI key has a couple that work
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:14.160]   with any device iOS or Mac OS. You'll have to have two factor set up, of course, already.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:20.080]   You'll need a browser that supports security sign in. But here's something you should keep in mind.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:29.360]   It won't work with older machines. So if you can't get your machine up to Mac OS 13 II or iOS
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:36.080]   16 III or iPad OS 16 III, you won't be able to use your key. So I don't know what the fallback is.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:41.680]   That's an issue. You can't sign into iCloud for Windows either.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:47.360]   Child accounts and managed IDs are not supported. And Apple watches won't work if you haven't paired
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.120]   them with your phone. You have to pair them with your phone, not a family member's iPhone. So if
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.520]   you're using it for your kids or a senior in your family or something like that, you have to
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.880]   redo it. To be safe with the fallback days. To be safe with the fallback days.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.480]   It's the end-to-end encryption. It's like this is a brand new security regime, basically. So you
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.160]   need all devices who support it. And so if you're going to support this, you've got to upgrade
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.320]   everything. You have to do that or it won't work. Yeah. Because if you have a fallback, if,
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.080]   for instance, they have a fallback, so don't worry if you don't have your key will text you,
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:26.160]   then that's the lowest. That's the security. That's the lowest. The whatever the worst security
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.320]   is. That's the one you got to watch out for, even if you will, but I need a key. No, you just
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:37.360]   need a text which we can snarf. So I presume Apple doing it right is going to make it pretty hard.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.560]   There. I mean, how do they say? Do they have a button that says lost my Yuba key?
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.200]   I'm so scared about doing this. It's just like advanced data protection, isn't it? It's like,
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.720]   I don't know. I don't want to get locked out of stuff.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:00.080]   Yeah. And for the fact matter is for this is this is an important new feature for the
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:07.120]   credibility of the entire platform. And you've got to go around for close to 40 years, but still,
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.760]   there are go, no-go points for certifying certain pieces of hardware for certain applications.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.040]   So it's good to have this hardware key, the hardware key support for most people. It's actually
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:23.520]   kind of important to have to be able to say, hi, Apple. Yeah, you know what I did? I did the stupid
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.800]   thing. I forgot this thing. Could you please give me access back to all my information? So yeah,
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.880]   don't don't do this because it's cool to have a key on your on your fob that makes you feel like
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.640]   a makes you feel like a super secret agent because at some point you're going to say, if I weren't
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:46.400]   so so worried about North Korean hackers busting in and finding out what my high scores are on all
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.320]   my games, I would not have to basically be reconstructing all of my playlists and all my photos and
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.600]   everything right now. Yeah, I think it's actually using a similar philosophy in another way to the
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.520]   end-end encryption stuff, which is it requires you to create two keys. So it's basically saying,
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:09.280]   as they should, you can have you can have a UB key, you need to add another key. So the idea there
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.600]   is that you're not they don't want you've got to have two baskets for your eggs, basically,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.760]   you could have two keys. You don't have to have two separate Google did this too when they did
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.880]   the advanced protection. And the reason is if you if you lose your UB key, your SOL. So the thought
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:32.160]   is that you read in fact, I often register three or four UB keys, put you know carry one of my key
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.520]   chain as I do here and then put the other ones in a safe in case you lose this one because otherwise,
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:43.200]   yeah, you're locked out. Yeah, yeah, so Apple's good in saying at least two, at least two. Yeah,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.240]   also you always have to keep in mind if you're especially for your organization,
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.040]   what if only one person has access to this important part of your business or your nonprofit or
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.840]   whatever and that person gets hit by a bus, you have to make sure that there's an outside way of
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.960]   getting into this data or else or else you're absolutely hosed. There's absolutely nothing Apple
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:10.080]   can do do for you right now. Although if you think about it, a key is maybe a better way to do it
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.960]   than something that might be locked up on my iPhone. If I have a key and I put it in a safe
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.520]   or a safety deposit box somewhere and I tell my wife that's the other key and so
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.680]   thing happens to me that actually could be easier for her than trying to figure out how to get
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.200]   into my phone so that she can do the authorization, etc, etc, etc. So that's probably a good thing.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.400]   But again, you need multiple keys. I presume Apple supports more than two. I haven't tried it.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:42.240]   A lot of, you know, a bit warden, when you can register is a number of keys, you can name them,
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   you could say that's the one in the safe, that's the one on my key chain. That's probably the
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.760]   right way to do it. I would imagine Apple's doing it right. The press release came out
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:56.080]   today. It says Apple builds on privacy commitment by unveiling new education and awareness efforts
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:02.800]   on data privacy day. Happy DPD. That's pretty darn exciting. So that's why that's why all
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.400]   those fireworks last night. We're all celebrating Saturday. Saturday is actually data privacy day.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.720]   But so why not make it a whole week? Apple decided that it's a whole week. You get the Monday off.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.000]   Yeah. Oh, I thought it was today. All right. It's a whole week. In any event, they're going to have
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.400]   starting Saturday. They're going to have a new today at Apple session, taking charge of your
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.280]   privacy on iPhone, which I think is great. And then we'll talk about male privacy protection,
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.400]   safety check location services and pass keys. I think that is really good.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.880]   Yeah. And it's a it's a personal service right at the Apple store. So they will actually look at
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.120]   your phone and say you could turn this on. This is what will happen and they can.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.400]   Well, I think that's great. I think that's great. So there's also a
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.840]   website for this, which is apple.co/what was it? I put it away before I
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:04.160]   skills dash privacy. You can register it at skills dash. I have to go to pleasant and wait a minute.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.240]   Let me let me get. Let me get. Well, I mean, just wait, download in quarter
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.480]   Madera before too long. That's where I want to go. I want to meet you at the quarter Madeira
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   store. There it is. Yeah, we can learn together. Let's learn together apply. Okay, skills. So they're
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:25.360]   doing it. Oh, I'm working. Man. That's a day after world privacy day. Come on. Come on. Man.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:33.600]   Oh, there's one the next Sunday. Oh, oh, okay. I read that there. It's an addition to the regular
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.160]   courseware available at Apple store. So should be like a regular class. Yeah, that's really good.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.560]   Encourage all your family and friends. Take advantage of it. They're free. Obviously,
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.880]   you have to reserve a place, but that's really a great thing. I'm really glad. And if you can't
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.600]   get to the Apple store, you can learn about those features from the somewhat funny,
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.800]   somewhat awkward comedy slash informational slash infomercial video that they made with
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:03.440]   Nick Muhammad from Ted Lasso that they also posted today. And it's, I mean, it's, you know,
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:09.040]   it's basically like a film you show in class at school where they try to make it entertaining.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.160]   But the subject matter is so dry that you can feel everybody's straining to make it entertaining
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.800]   and they sort of have a metal level where they know that you know that they know that it's not.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.600]   But it's what I like about it is that, you know, people don't understand this stuff. And it does
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.720]   try to explain it. It is obviously puffing up Apple's credentials about security and privacy
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.480]   here, but it's better than nothing if you can't get to an Apple store for the one to one. Let's
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.400]   just watch a little bit for those of you on YouTube, you're going to see a slideshow so that Apple
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.960]   doesn't know we're doing this. But for those, well, our alarm clock, I'll narrate it. No, turn on
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.000]   the sound. Come on. This is just, look it. Let me stop right here. Hold on. Let me explain this.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.760]   If we put this on YouTube, we'll get taken down.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:07:00.720]   Audio tip. Right. But don't edit it now. Do it live and edit it. You're going to, when you
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:06.080]   edit the show, do the slideshow and take the sound out because the podcast people are not
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.000]   affected by what YouTube does, right? The podcast will not be affected.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.080]   It's just so that's why I put the sound on now because 90%, 95% of our audience doesn't watch it
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.040]   on YouTube. So we're just going to make those poor five percent of the audience have to watch a
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:29.120]   slideshow with no audio. But put the audio on now. I'll do some other, just play it normally, please.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:35.680]   Thank you. I know I hate the chilling effect of YouTube. We are now in Nick Muhammad's flat.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.680]   People go about their daily. Okay, that's very uncomfortable. He's just woken up and there's some
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.880]   guy in an apple shirt. But that's the bit. That's the bit in his house. He's playing it.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.960]   And used to track. Okay. But, but, but actually, let's let's be frank secure. He's sleeping on,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:55.920]   he's got like a king size bed. He's sleeping on one bed. And to help illustrate the point.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.760]   So you think there was somebody else there and they got rid of her before they started shooting?
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.800]   Well, I think that the premise of this video is that Nick Muhammad is lonely, actually.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.080]   That's kind of what the idea is here. Exactly. The mind,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.200]   that's pretty much a long time relationship that just ended. Oh, I get it. He's still hoping
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.440]   that they'll come back. And it looks like he's living in the little house they built in the apple
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:23.360]   building to show off there. Yeah. Okay. Just checking. We're going to take a look at a day in the
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.000]   life of an average person's data. Whoa. Wow. Sorry. What do you mean by average? He's drinking.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.520]   How is it? How tight is a concept? Are we? Is that? Wait a minute. That's not Nick. That's,
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:39.200]   that's the, that's the coach, right? The other coach, the assistant. This is Nick Muhammad. He is
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.400]   the, he is the guy who's the, yeah, he's like the club. He's the great, yeah. And
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.240]   he becomes, he's like the villain of the,
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.200]   okay. He's the villain of season three. Oh, and season three. I'm watching.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:57.440]   I'm watching. Boilers in Ted Lasso. I see him bouncing a very average day,
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:04.240]   going to really average film set to do some very average filming. Why is heading out? This feels
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.840]   like a feeling is low. Is that because this is the fake house that they built in this sound stage?
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.960]   I don't think so. It feels like it's low. Okay. We're going to learn more about,
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.640]   use the chapters below to skip ahead. All right. Let's get that interactive. Yeah. Okay. Now we're
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.280]   in a, on a street, email marketers love following your email activity. Mail privacy protection.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.920]   Not the first time I've been followed. Just wait a second. This guy is fine. Go for it.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:35.920]   Right. Okay. I've seen enough. That's not worth getting taken down from YouTube for.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.200]   Yeah. Getting a lot of Ricky travays vibes out of that performance, by the way.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.440]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's basically the premise is that he's, he's kind of like trying to,
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.640]   he's very defensive and trying to make himself seem more of a star than he is,
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.120]   and then being taught these things about privacy. And like I said, it's, it's kind of funny,
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:00.400]   but also very much like in that school informational video where we're throwing some jokes, but we're
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.480]   really trying to get you to eat your vegetables here. It's inevitable. Did it be a little bit like
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.000]   that? Because it is that way. It is veg. I like that they made the effort here, right? That they
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.920]   actually are trying to get this stuff across. Because it is so like, we've all tried to explain
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.320]   this to our less technical friends and family members. And it's, it's kind of hard, right? Like,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.680]   just be like, what are these features and why do you want them and why do you care about them
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   and why do they matter? And yes, it is also very much in an ad basically, it is self-serving in the
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.480]   sense that is, this is Apple's whole privacy, that's iPhone ad campaign. This is essentially what,
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:36.240]   an extension of that. Right. So it's five minutes. I didn't watch it, but it contains all,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.200]   all you would need to know to implement this stuff or is it just shows the screens and where
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.320]   the switches are and what they mean and sort of basic concepts. Yeah.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:50.560]   It's cool that they got, I wish they'd gotten Hannah instead to do it. That would be more interesting
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.280]   or who's Nick Bahamud was available. Nick was available. He wasn't working at the moment. He had
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.880]   some time. But that's fun. You know, if you're a Ted Lasso fan, that's kind of fun, right? He's
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.120]   a good character in that show. Well, and if Bahamud's actually a very talented
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.600]   come, come meet a gasket. Oh, he's a bunch of stuff. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. Cool. So he has.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.680]   And I think also that it continues the narrative that Apple just keeps beating down of how much
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.480]   you're being tracked around. You know, and that. So in addition to teaching you some things,
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:28.720]   it's also just continuing the stoking of the paranoia that might be healthy to understand how
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.960]   much you're being tracked. And so, and I think that, of course, undermines a lot of other things
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.800]   around Apple. Right. Good. Well, I'm glad Apple's doing it anyway. And I
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.760]   really glad that they added the keys. I mean, this seems to be the more than lip service.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.080]   They're really walking the walk. Right. Again, they're slowly tightening and
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.600]   noose. Yeah. Like, I think that they're not, this isn't a, they're not doing everything all at one
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.200]   time. I think they just keep on pulling these things in because they did them all at one time.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.880]   People would freak out and, you know, there'd be a bunch of people that are upset and they're
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.160]   just slowly pulling all these privacy things, you know, just tucking them in one step at a time.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.480]   I'm a little surprised that they haven't gotten more government pushback. Maybe they are,
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.480]   behind the scenes. Oh, I think they are. Yeah. You notice that no one ever complained that they
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.240]   couldn't get into somebody's blackberry. Like, even though that was what everybody used for that.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.200]   Right. Just odd. You know, that wasn't, but they still are, but I think that they, I think that the
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.760]   government has kind of lost the, they have a way to get in right now for a lot of the phones that
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.920]   are out there. And so they're complaining a little bit less, but, you know, they're going to,
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.000]   Apple's going to keep on tightening. But I think that that's also where we saw a lot of the child
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.120]   pornography issues that Apple did as they keep on tightening these up. They're also trying to
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.480]   close the loopholes or the gaps that the government uses to try to open it back up again.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.480]   So, Andy, you said you were glad to be on a show where you didn't have to talk about tech
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:58.480]   layoffs. Apple seems to be the only company in Silicon Valley that is not laying people off.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:06.320]   Watch Street Journal had an article about why that is. And actually, if you compare
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:13.920]   Apple's hiring over the last couple of years to all of these other companies,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.480]   you know, they went, the other companies went crazy hiring.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:26.960]   How is Apple so far avoided layoffs? Wall Street Journal says, lean hiring,
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.480]   and no free lunches. They charge, don't they? They charge for the free lunch.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.800]   They do charge for the lunch. But I think that I think the free lunch,
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.480]   I think it was a little absurd. Like the amount of cost per employee is so low.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.440]   That was a kind of thing. Well, that's one of the first things Elon got rid of it. Twitter.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.760]   So here's that I think this is really what it's all about. From its fiscal year end in September
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   2019 to 2022, Apple's workforce grew 20%, 164,000 full-time employees,
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:07.280]   65,000 of them in retail, I might add. Over the same period, employee counted Amazon doubled,
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:18.480]   Microsoft up 53%, Google up 57%, Facebook 94%. So of course, you know, it makes sense. When you
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.520]   double your employee count in a year, it makes sense that you're maybe going to have to
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:30.720]   fire some people at some point. Yeah. At last week's Open Town Hall meeting,
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:36.320]   Sidar Pichai, like the day after they fired 12% of their workforce, his explanation was
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.880]   basically that they made some hiring decisions about a year, a year and a half ago, based on
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.240]   based on the idea that certain trends would continue and they'd be in a good position to
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.640]   capitalize on it. And as he said at the meeting that that obviously the economy changed and
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:15:00.400]   the good times they were counting on did not actually happen. So I mean, we've spoken a lot
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.840]   before about how odd sometimes it is that we hear that, oh, well, Apple, the reason why we're
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.360]   not going to be expecting a whole big, a whole lot of updates to iPadOS or Mac OS this year,
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.880]   because they've pulled engineers off of those projects to put them on to other projects.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.040]   And why don't they just hire more staff so they don't have to pull people off of projects and slow
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.920]   other things down? Well, now we see philosophically why that is. It's better. It's nasty to be
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.000]   a little bit stretched out as an engineer, but I suppose that if you compare that to having a
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.680]   little bit more of job security that they're not over-hiring for what they need, and they're
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.240]   maybe not going to have to cut 10% of their workforce back, maybe that will help make them feel a
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.920]   bit better about having to suddenly develop a operating system software for virtual reality
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.680]   glasses instead of working on this feature for the Mac OS they've been thinking about for the
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:58.080]   past three years. I think Apple's also probably resistant to culture change or culture disintegration.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.160]   I don't think they want to add that many people that fast because it's just really hard to keep
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.960]   what you do the way you do it. It's hard to maintain control of that when you start
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.560]   at it, when you double the size or you increase by 50%. I think that 20% was probably the outer
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.920]   edge of what Apple was willing to do because they want a certain number of people there for a
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.240]   certain amount of time so they can kind of, you know, assimilate them. It sounds like
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:26.160]   into how they do it. As the journal points out that Apple's business maybe is somewhat more
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.320]   resilient to downturns than these other advertising-focused businesses. There's also a lot less
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.760]   SKUs. I mean, the other organizations have so many products that when you think of the advertising,
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:43.200]   all the software development and all the other things, Apple's producing less different things
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.960]   than everybody else. And generally, they're not cutting them out very often.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:56.800]   Feel for anybody who's lost their job. In fact, it was a little grim on Twitter over the last few
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:03.200]   days reading the farewells from Google employees, many of whom had been there for more than a decade
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.040]   to 20 years in some cases. You're a company for 20 years and you're summarily fired.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.320]   That doesn't look like right sizing. That really looks like, you know, your whole life has been
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.360]   turned upside down. It's not that the people were just hired or the people were now being fired.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:26.080]   In many cases, it's people have been there for a lot longer. So that's why there's a little-
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:37.680]   You can tell- I've worked in a contract, I did an out of a lot of companies.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.840]   And one of the things that's interesting is you can tell the employees that have been through
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:48.880]   downturns because the moment you have a meeting with them, you'll get hit with LinkedIn.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.040]   No, a lot of people do that. It's good practice.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.320]   They keep their resume up to date. They keep their network fresh.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.040]   Everything's- They're always happy for the next time.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.520]   And they're not, but they're not necessarily, but they keep all those contacts warm.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.440]   And you can tell that somebody who's been in this industry for a little while and gone up and down,
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.280]   that they try to keep spreading out. And they're always doing people favors.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.720]   Like they're always like, not nothing out of the shouldn't do, but connecting you with this
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.920]   person and connecting you with that because what they're doing is they're building that network
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.520]   with people all around them. And they're constantly keeping all of that warm.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.240]   And it took me a little while to understand- I actually was talking to someone at a phone
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.880]   company about that. They were like, "Well, you never know how long you're going to be here."
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.600]   It's just like strippers, frankly.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.920]   I never connected that. That was interesting.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.480]   It's in my mind. And I bet you, Andy, you saw it on Reddit too. There's somebody-
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:52.560]   it was a stripper who posted an Excel spreadsheet and then graphs of her income over several years
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.400]   period and then answered some questions. She apparently been keeping it in a spreadsheet.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.240]   And she said, "Really? The minute you get to the club, you've got to cultivate these
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.080]   various customers. The way you get a bigger payday is making friends with them before you
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.280]   get on stage." So it's just like that. You've got to build your network.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:14.080]   But I think that that's- I think a lot of people get into this mode of,
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.280]   "I'm just working where I'm working. I just want to do my thing and I don't want to talk to it."
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.800]   You know, I don't want to really interact. And that's where you-
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.280]   that becomes a pretty unstable place to be in a lot of these things is to do that.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.400]   And so you do want to be heads down, but you also have to pay attention to the realities of the
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.120]   market. But I do think that Apple has only- I think the last time Apple laid anybody off was in the
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:41.040]   late '90s. Like that was like the Steve Jobs came in and rited the fire and let off a couple,
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.760]   like 4,000 people. And I don't think they've laid- they've had any layoff after that.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.040]   And like they- and I also think that there is a- within the management,
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.760]   I think that there's definitely a culture of still being like the scars of the late '90s
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:04.800]   are deep, so deep. And they- Apple worries about every penny of what they do. And they think about-
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:11.360]   I mean, I know people that have worked there and they think about 1997 every day.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:18.400]   Yeah, my dad, who passed away about 10 years ago, he grew up in the depression.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.200]   And when I was a kid, like we didn't throw anything away, we had like broken like electric
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.840]   razors in the barn that was like maybe we'll fix it someday. He could make almost anything or
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.120]   fix almost anything with like the wire from a coat hanger. Like that mentality stays with you.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.720]   Depression mentality. If you go through those formative years and Apple,
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:41.520]   I'm telling you, Steve Jobs returning to Apple in '97 when they were near death.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.680]   One of the- we talk about the culture he built, right? Because he really rebuilt the
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.880]   Apple culture when he came back there. And that was one of the biggest products he did
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:55.280]   was Apple culture. So it could outlive him. And one aspect of it that doesn't get talked about
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:02.160]   enough is this depression, bankruptcy mentality, where they are very slow to hire, they are very
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.080]   reluctant to spend money. And you get those moments where you're like, you guys have all the money,
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.000]   spend the money. And they're like, maybe not, you never know rainy day, whatever. And it can be good,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.560]   and it can be bad. But in a case where they're so slow and deliberate with their hiring, I think
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.800]   to a fault, it is an advantage in a situation like this where everybody's looking for, you know,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:28.080]   demonstrations of responsibility from big corporations. And Apple gets to use a different
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:34.880]   demonstration that is basically that we hired slow and we didn't over hire instead of having to throw,
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.040]   you know, some jobs on the fire in order to prove that they're paying attention, which I think a
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:44.480]   lot of these other companies are doing. And then Google gets, did you see that letter that was
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:51.840]   sent up by one of their stock stakeholders? A very minor investor that was taking credit for
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.560]   you got to make, oh man, you got to lay people off, you got to do it, you got to do it. This is enough.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.080]   It was like, that was a good start, the 12,000, I was like, did you actually put that in print?
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:06.240]   Like, did you like the, did you think that that was okay to say like that was hedge fund
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:14.960]   billionaire Christopher Hohn said that decision to cut to 12,000 jobs is a step in the right direction,
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.720]   but it does not reverse the headcount growth of 2022. I don't think that's the
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:26.720]   intention is to reverse the headcount of growth of 2022. Hohn said the management
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.360]   was to go far. A lot of investors out there who think that they run the companies they bought
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:38.800]   shares in and they mostly have. I own shares. I am an owner. A lot of them are getting fixated
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:44.880]   on a very, very simplistic metric, which is how much revenue does this company generate per employee?
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.560]   And they figure that, well, look, if you're not generating more, if not generating as much as
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.640]   X per employee, you have too many employees easily just fire half your staff and suddenly
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:57.280]   your revenue for employee will double. And now when I want everything to be wonderful.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.720]   And so, yeah, that's not something that you take really super seriously,
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.240]   we're sure that that's when you hear someone saying you have you simply have too many people,
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.720]   you have to follow that up with because why, like what are the what are the too many people not
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.440]   doing? Are they paying people to do thing double work? Are you being super inefficient? Are you
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:21.680]   just simply saying that you if you're not having employees quit after two and a half years from
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.880]   extreme burnout, then you're not driving them hard enough? I don't think so.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.280]   I think that home is probably one of the people in a group of
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.600]   financial people who think that Elon Musk did the right thing with Twitter. And this is how
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:41.920]   every company should be operated and cut to the bone. Of course, I think it's funny.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.040]   Get those nerds out of there.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040]   Get those nerds. What do you need them for?
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.960]   Just feed them sandwiches and spend money.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:47.440]   Yeah, free food.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:55.440]   Yeah. Hey, Andy and I both have this concern. When Apple bought Prime Fonic,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:01.920]   which was a very nice classical music service, they promised that they would bring it to iOS.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.320]   They killed the service. They did give us refunds for our subscriptions, but
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   still hasn't come back. There was some code in 16.3 mentioning a standalone classical music app,
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:22.960]   but I was disappointed when 16.3 came out that a new Apple classical music app did not appear on my
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.920]   phone. So, Andy, any thoughts?
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:36.320]   I think that we're just looking at Apple's realization that will we get more subscribers by
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:41.600]   being able to say, "Hey, here's how wonderful our classical music is." I think that they know that
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:48.800]   if they promote higher quality music files, if they promote spatial audio,
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.160]   not only will they say that, "Hey, we've got something that's Spotify does not have that will
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.560]   also be able to say," and, "Hey, what a great reason for you to spend $250 for our new headphones,
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.920]   as opposed to $80 ones that you've been using right now." So, yeah, I'm sure we'll see it, but
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.960]   they don't have the resources to simply say, "They're one of those resources to simply
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.400]   burst into a room and saying, 'This is ridiculous. We need to get this launched now, now, now.'
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.800]   It'll happen when it happens. Well, they did promise it would happen in 2022.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:22.160]   Obviously, we who love classical music are a small minority that don't move the needle.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.040]   You still get classical music on Apple music. I know that, but
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.240]   Promphonic was focused on classical and had some really nice features. I kind of wish they just
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.800]   hadn't bought it, if they weren't going to do something with it. I wish they had it.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.400]   I mean, it feels like they're definitely coming. It's just not like it got delayed. I can't
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:43.120]   imagine that they would buy it and that there's so much evidence that it's about ready to happen
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.760]   and that they would pull the plug on it. It doesn't make sense.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.720]   They want to get it right. Well, they want to get it right. I think a lot of it could be
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.760]   licensing as well because that was a really, the Promphonic had a really deep catalog,
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:03.520]   which is not to minimize the fact that really classical music is an area where
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.600]   if you were to justify having a separate app with a separate user interface just for this category
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.480]   of music, you could maybe do it. And Primephonic definitely did because there's one thing to say,
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.080]   'Hey, I want to hear Beethoven's third symphony. Great. Here are two copies of it.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.480]   Hey, aren't we great? We have two.' But then you have people who are into classical music who are
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.880]   like, actually, I want to hear the Leonard Bernstein recording or I was just reading an article about
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:35.360]   how this one conductor I'd never heard of had his own attitude towards it. I want to find a record.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.640]   I know this only a 1953 recording that was transcribed off of a radio disc,
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.080]   but I want to hear it anyway. Whereas that's not the sort of depth that Spotify or Apple Music
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:50.800]   or any other traditional music service. That's not the sort of depth that's going to pay off. Whereas
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.600]   a specific classical service is going to say, 'No, we are going to make sure we can get the
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.680]   rights to that 1953 transcription disc. We are going to get the rights to these
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.480]   Sopranos and tenors from the 20s and 30s whose recordings are garbage, but they're the only
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.480]   surviving recordings of this particular performance.' So it's hard.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.920]   Yeah, I have Maria Callis doing... I can't remember which opera, Truvieta, I think.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.960]   And it's not a great recording, but it's Maria Callis. And so you want to hear that, right?
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   HomePod got an update as well, by the way, with 16.3. And they've turned on. We mentioned they
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.280]   have temperature and humidity sensors and the mini and the new second-generation HomePod.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.680]   They turned it on. I don't know what they're going to do with it.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.160]   It's going to be for some workflows. Yeah, for some triggers.
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.280]   Yeah, for some triggers. Automation Home automation triggers to have those in your
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.760]   various rooms and be able to key off of them. Yeah.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:49.120]   Suri's confirmation tone will now play to indicate when smart home requests are completed.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.080]   For accessories that may not show a visible change or are in a different room,
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.960]   remastered ambient sounds are more immersive. Okay. And it could be at the scenes,
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.720]   automations, and alarms in the home app. Find My on HomePod now allows you to ask Siri for the
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.360]   location of family and friends if they've shared it with you. I like that. I'll be saying,
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:18.080]   "Hey, you know, Shlomo, where's my wife?" Well, that's cool. That's kind of cool.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.640]   We have in our family, we all agree to keep our location turned on so that we can make sure
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:31.120]   everybody's home or not or safe. You can have recurring Home Automation set up with just your
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:40.080]   voice. Do you think Siri's going to get smarter? The reason I ask, we're seeing this
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:46.080]   Cambrian explosion of AI with mid-journey and stable diffusion and images, chat,
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:51.840]   GPT in text. Microsoft has now announced they are, yes, indeed putting billions of dollars
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:58.720]   into open AI so that they can have some artificial intelligence in office and other things.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:10.800]   I feel like this is kind of exploding. But Apple is not, there was a good, I'll point to Ben Thompson,
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:17.360]   who wrote a very nice piece in Stratecary, which I, you may have to subscribe to, I do,
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:25.840]   to read. He talks about AI in the big five. How AI, he says, and I think I kind of agree with him,
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:34.480]   that AI is a new tech epic. The PC, the internet, cloud computing, mobile, all changed everything.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.520]   And he thinks that's going to about to happen now with AI.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:45.520]   So, and I thought this was really interesting, Ben is a smart fella. He quotes Joel Spolsky,
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:53.120]   a famous line in his strategy letter five. Smart companies try to commoditize their product
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:30:00.960]   compliments, by which he means, if you have a watch or a phone, you want to make it
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   all of the things that go on the phone, the apps for instance, as close to commodity pricing
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.720]   as possible. And Apple has done a very good job with that. In some cases, making it open source
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:18.240]   is a way to do that. Apple invests in open source technologies, Ben writes, most notably,
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:25.120]   the Darwin kernel and the web kit browser engine, which fits Spolsky's prescription as in
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.080]   ensuring that the web works well with Apple devices. So that makes your Apple devices more
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:35.520]   valuable. Now, let's talk about AI. Apple's efforts in AI, meanwhile, have been largely
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.160]   proprietary. Traditional machine learning models are used for things like recommendations and
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.640]   photo identification and voice recognition, but nothing that moves the needle for Apple
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:51.040]   in a business in a major way. But they did receive a gift from stable diffusion. And we
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:57.200]   talked about this when they did it. Apple actually modified stable diffusion to work better with
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:04.560]   Apple Silicon. They optimized core ML for stable diffusion. He points out, because Apple controls
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:11.360]   the hardware, the chips, they could actually, besides doing optimized software for stable diffusion,
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:19.680]   they could tune Apple's chips, the neural engine, to be better at things like stable diffusion.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.400]   He says, it seems likely that Apple chips, if not this year, then probably next year will be
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:29.280]   tuned for stable diffusion, as well as other Apple's own needs, stable diffusion itself,
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:36.880]   meanwhile, could be built into Apple's operating systems. So it's interesting, because Apple,
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:42.480]   which has kept its AI stuff internal and private and not frankly done a very good job with Siri,
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:49.600]   does have an opportunity because they make the silicon to make some of this open source stuff
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.960]   better. You think, what do you think Apple's AI strategy is?
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:01.040]   The rumor is they're spending a lot of money on Siri, whether it's successful or not.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:06.880]   And the rumor isn't just pumping a lot of money. Well, we know Amazon loses $10 billion a year on
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:14.080]   Echo, you know, ALEXA. It's easy to lose a lot of money. Sam Altman says that they're spending a
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.840]   ton of money, hundreds of millions of dollars a month on chat GPT. Andy, go ahead.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:29.840]   I just think the big problem is that no company has positioned a smart speaker,
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.240]   smart audio with smart assistant, as anything other than here's how to trigger a function,
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:39.440]   here's how to call for a playlist, here's how to set a timer. There's been so much
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:45.440]   unexploded potential to really turn this into an augmented reality operating system, where
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:51.360]   this is an audio interface to an entire operating system. This is an audio interface to apps that
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:58.080]   we can let people to develop to interact with this audio assistant. It's as sophisticated as
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:02.080]   the Google Assistant is compared with Siri and others. It's still the sort of thing where
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:06.640]   ask it to do a canned feature. It will do that canned feature in a very, very humanistic way.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:11.360]   As opposed to let me have a conversation with the software to solve a problem or create something
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:16.560]   that I need created or do something that I need done. That's because that's the way that we
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:20.880]   interact with computers. We have a keyboard, we have a mouse, we have a conversation between
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:24.720]   key presses and mouse clicks about here's something I want to do. You are going to help me do it
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.240]   because you have more resources and connected to the internet. I'm not. If Apple were to basically
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:35.920]   put the words OS at the end of Siri and basically develop it with that kind of an attitude, I think
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.160]   they could make a lot of really big leaps forward in a very short amount of time.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:45.200]   And chat GPT is not the biggest factor here. It really is just that attitude about how are we
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.480]   going to present this thing? I think that also, some of it is brand risk for all of the organizations
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:57.760]   that are involved. All the big organizations is being wrong, is worse than not saying anything.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.520]   There's the saying that's usually attributed to LinkedIn that it's better to keep one's mouth shut
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.920]   and look foolish than to open it and remove all doubt. The issue is when you open up,
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:09.680]   like I have chat GPT opened almost all day. It just sits over there and I
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:13.520]   flail at it. Do this, do this, do this. Let me see what you're going to do here.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:20.000]   It's wrong about 20, 30%. It is like, right, hat and Lee wrong. Not like a little wrong,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.960]   but it sounds totally normal. It is a... It's what we call confidently wrong.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:31.360]   It's confidently wrong. And the issue is that if Apple started having some... So
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.360]   chat GPT can do that because OpenAI is like, "Hey, we're experimenting, we're having fun,
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:40.400]   and this is not important." But if you're putting that into a speaker, if it's off 1% of the time,
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.920]   Apple is going to get roasted. And so the need, I think that the issue that Apple has is
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:51.440]   and Google and everyone else is we want to make sure that we're carefully certain
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:58.800]   that we're giving you the right solution before we do it because we want to be right.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:02.640]   And they're giving up the ability to do all the things it could do to be right,
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.880]   99.99999% of the time. And so almost every response that you get is something someone looked
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.800]   at and said, "Yeah, we can... That's a good response for that thing." And then if I don't know that,
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.960]   I'm going to tell you I found it on the web. I found this on the web.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.360]   In a way, this is the innovator's dilemma though. That's... And that, by the way, is how
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:26.880]   he begins this article is, "Yeah, you're doing fine now." But remember, Apple is
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:32.400]   massively successful in the last decade because of the iPhone. They were right on
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:38.320]   top of that complete transformation in computing, the new graphic. They created it, exactly right.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:46.640]   They created it. And they are desperately with the car and with the AR/VR and with health,
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:52.320]   looking for the next thing. What if the next thing's AI? And Ben seems to think it is, and I think he
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.920]   might be right. Is Apple going to be competitive there or is the innovator's dilemma, the unwillingness
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:03.360]   to risk their core business to get into the new one, is it going to harm them in the long run?
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   They've got a bunch of really smart people working on AI and ML stuff at Apple. I mean,
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.640]   you look at the fact that they've been talking about the neural engine all this time.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640]   Yeah, they're building it in the hardware for sure.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:21.520]   They have been four years building in machine learning processor cores directly into their hardware.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.280]   On that level, they're there. But I think the interesting question is like,
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:30.400]   where did they take that? And we started this conversation by talking about Siri. And I think
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.560]   that's a great example where Alex is completely right. Imagine the stories that are written
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.120]   if Siri gives a wrong answer to something. I mean, that already happens, right? But if it's an AI
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:43.680]   driven confidence Siri that's giving completely wrong answers, that's bad. So they have to be
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:49.200]   careful. At the same time, obviously, what they've been doing with Siri for the last 10 years
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:55.200]   hasn't really worked. And my impression is that in the background, this is absolutely what they're
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:01.520]   doing with Siri is they're trying to do a better AI driven model for Siri that will be more
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:07.120]   responsive and understand you and maybe even understand the conversation. But the innovators
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.600]   dilemma is absolutely true, which is they can't launch that until it's actually good. Whereas
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.880]   open AI or something can just put out a thing and say, here's a bot we wrote. It makes stuff up,
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:21.200]   but who cares? And Apple can't do that. And Apple doesn't want people to like kids writing
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:27.360]   writing their term papers with Siri, that kind of thing. And so I think that keeping
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.360]   themselves away from that, especially before this lawsuit that just I think it was just filed,
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.240]   I think the big companies want to watch what happens with the San Francisco lawsuit against
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.680]   chat, against open AI and mid-journey and Dolly, or not mid-journey and stable diffusion.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:49.280]   And they want to watch that if they lose, if the artists that lose that, the gates will be open.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.760]   They'll be a trillion dollars dropped into this because the uncertainty has kept everybody on
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.920]   the sideline. When there's no uncertainty anymore, everyone's going to move really fast.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.200]   And the thing is, but I think what Apple's doing potentially is doing exactly what was
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:09.280]   talked about here, which is they don't necessarily want to sell AI. So they're going to make it
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.480]   essentially worthless. They're going to commoditize it. They're going to basically say,
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.040]   we're going to give you all the hardware to do it. They may not need to own it to
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.360]   basically make it available. They give you what you need, the platform to do it.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.920]   They need it for their AR. They need it for the VR. They need it for a lot of other things. But
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.400]   they may try to control parts of it, but they may really want it to be something that isn't
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:37.120]   something that is of intrinsic value on its own. Yeah, that really is the key here. Apple still
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.640]   is a hardware company. They make money by making a physical product and selling that physical product
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:50.080]   to people at a specific markup. So that's two different ways of thinking about it. Either Apple is in,
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.680]   as Alex says, a good position because they could not necessarily be developing the greatest AI
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:01.360]   products, but simply make sure that every time there is a new AI platform, every time there is
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:07.520]   a new AI model that their hardware runs it better than anybody else. So that when Photoshop considers,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080]   hey, wouldn't it be great if we could add a descriptive feature that simply says, hey,
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.600]   take the four figures to the left, make them a little brighter, but take the three trees on the
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.560]   right in the background. I want it to look like it's winter and not fall. When that only happens on
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:29.440]   Macs and not on Windows machines, that's a big win. On the other hand, if AI truly becomes commoditized,
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:34.240]   if the thing that people really love about it is not necessarily a feature that's buried inside
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:40.080]   of an existing app, but simply something as good as the trustworthiness and the scope of Google search,
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:46.800]   but and the reliability of Google search, but also hooked up to a real knowledge navigator style,
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.840]   I can have a conversation with this with this AI, learn get the information that I want,
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:57.040]   and then take actions based on this data that I've learned in a very, very conversational way.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:02.160]   Once the iPhone simply becomes a microphone and a speaker or worse yet, an internet connection
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:09.040]   to a Bluetooth earbud that I can buy for $80 at an in store, that could be a problem if that becomes
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:15.840]   the next revolution. Ben says Microsoft might end up being the big winner here because
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:21.200]   partly of the investment into open AI, they put a billion dollars in initially,
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:25.680]   and allegedly are putting in another $10 billion incorporating into their office,
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:32.080]   but also he says Bing could be the big winner because putting AI into a search engine might
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.280]   make suddenly Bing competitive against Google. I've mentioned this before, a search engine
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:46.000]   called NIVA, it's a paid search engine from former Google folks. Let me show you what it
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.480]   does with AI, which is kind of interesting. I'm going to type in your name Andy, A-N-D-Y. I have
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:41:01.600]   no idea. Andy Inaco, I think I got that right. It generates a AI paragraph about you,
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:07.200]   which is and then it has footnotes saying what sources it came from, and it's only two cases
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.640]   in this case. What was the name of Nate, the guy, what's his, what's the actor's name?
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:20.800]   Nick, what's his name? We've forgotten. Well, I mean, that's part of the bit. He's going to be
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.280]   very angry at us. What's his lesson? Hey, Mohammed. Mohammed.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:29.440]   Like, you know, there he is. All right, let's see what it generates. So it generates these,
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.080]   and it's not in real time. You can actually see it doing it, and then it has his best known for
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:40.560]   his character, Mr. Swallow. He's also known for Nate the Great, graduated first from the
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.720]   University of Durham, first of the US, will be the attend next month's Emmy Awards.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:51.920]   So I like this. This is their knowledge navigator equivalent to Google, and it's using AI.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:58.720]   Bing might do something similar to this, but I think these are very basic uses of what I love
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:05.040]   wrong. You described Andy, and it's wrong. But it's wrong. I mean, next month's Emmy Awards are over.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:10.000]   So it's using old news sources and not changing the dates and all of those things.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.640]   Right. Okay, that's a lot of the stuff in my bio is like five, six, seven, eight years out of
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:24.480]   date. Right. All right. So that's there's part of the pitfalls to this. But I think that what you
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.560]   just described is that image editor using using intelligence like that might be really powerful.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.880]   So there will be ways to do this. I think that work and are not risking this factual flaw.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.320]   He also says, yeah, I'll be honest. Nvidia might be the big winners because they're doing,
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.080]   you know, the with the CUDA cores, they're doing graphics stuff that's very powerful in AI
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.440]   and machine learning. And they're it could be it just that the advantage that Apple has is
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.800]   putting it on the edge. So having people have really powerful processors that do it at their house,
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.920]   rather than in the the issue, I mean, I think the Nvidia stuff's going to do really well.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:09.200]   But it's going to be more of a server based, you know, like you're sending it away somewhere
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:12.240]   or doing things. It's not it's me less of like I'm putting this in my house to do that. I mean,
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:15.920]   some people will, right. But it's going to be a lot more expensive. One of those cards,
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:18.480]   I think costs more than, you know, considerably more than a machining.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:27.680]   So wow, Dwindel asked chat GPT to tell him a joke about me. And thank you, chat GPT said,
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:31.280]   I'm sorry, I am not aware of any jokes about Leel's port.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:38.240]   He is a well known technology journalist, author and broadcaster. It would be inappropriate
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.800]   to create a joke about him. Right on daddy.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:48.560]   I was just in the street like a colossus. He could break me like a piece of uncooked pasta.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.920]   Wow, who's in the pocket of big twig?
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.960]   Leel, he's in the pocket of big Leo. Absolutely. So I do think I think this is an important
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:03.920]   conversation because I do think that Ben is right. The next epic in in computing is going to be all
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:10.080]   about AI and machine learning. And I'd be very interested to see how Apple can find its way in
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.640]   that. And as of right now.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.160]   I think that the question is, do you need to create it or do you need to use it? And I think
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:24.080]   that that's the issue is that there's ways to not create it, but to use it in the things that
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.320]   you're doing that Apple can definitely take advantage of. I mean, when I think about what's
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.240]   going to happen with computer graphics and all these other things as we play with these things,
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:38.000]   it's going to be very, very creative. And I think that Apple may be angling towards
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:42.080]   harnessing what's out there rather than trying to create it themselves.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.640]   I like in the pocket of big twig. I think that's good. I'm going to
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:56.080]   create a pocket. I would say I'm very optimistic about Apple and AI as well. I think it's very
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.240]   clear that the company has spent years thinking about this. I mean, really, its investment in
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.960]   building the neural engine is just a great example of how Apple has, because really, if
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:10.240]   there's anything the show that Apple has you on its radar, it's when it puts you on its Apple
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:16.240]   Silicon plans, like on the roadmap. And it did that years ago for this stuff. And so it feels
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:20.080]   like they want to be there. They want their hardware to be good at this. They want to be able to
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.400]   leverage that hardware to build their own. I mean, there's a lot of machine learning driven stuff
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:29.840]   inside that Apple doesn't talk about as much, about inside the photos app in terms of not just
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:35.840]   scanning your library, but also doing automatic updates, improvements to the photos. They're doing,
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:42.080]   they've invested a lot of stuff in it. Again, I will say, I wonder about Siri, but leaving that
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.000]   aside, I think that they're not missing the boat on this. This is not one of those areas where we're
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.800]   like, geez, Apple hasn't said anything. Do they even know what's happening? They absolutely do
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:57.360]   when it comes to machine learning. Last year's Oscars, Apple made history, winning three awards,
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:03.920]   best picture, best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay for Coda. This year in the Oscars,
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:09.520]   Apple's nominations are a little bit more scant this morning's Oscar nominations were announced.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.800]   They got two nominations, best supporting actor for Brian Tyree Henry in Causeway,
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.360]   which I didn't even was I didn't know it was a movie, but it's there.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:26.960]   And they got a nomination for animated short, the boy, the mole, the fox in the horse.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:34.240]   Which is if nothing else, a dark horse possibility for animated short, but anyway,
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:39.200]   it's not going to have that big year that it had last year. It's kind of interesting,
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:46.080]   not for lack of crying. Well, it's a real sniff. Yeah. If he hadn't done that thing,
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.280]   he might have a shot with a man's a patient, but boy, it's interesting how that got buried. I mean,
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:58.480]   buried after last year's Oscar slap. Because normally that's the kind of prestige film about
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:00.480]   it's Oscar bait. That's Oscar bait. Yeah.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:07.280]   It just goes to show you how much how much this is manipulated by marketing that they once they
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.360]   pull the marketing budget for something, there's just no chance of it finding an audience or getting
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:17.600]   a awards. And if you're in Hollywood during during the Oscar, the voting time, for your consideration,
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:22.560]   for your consideration. Oh my goodness. Actually, that's one of the big stories down. And we'll
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:28.640]   talk about it tomorrow a little bit more on the twig. But there was a best actress nomination for
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:35.760]   Andrea Rizebrow in a movie to Leslie, which hardly anybody saw. There was only made $27,000.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:45.840]   But there was a grassroots campaign among Hollywood to on Twitter to get attention for this movie
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:51.360]   and this actor. And it succeeded. She did get a nomination. Kate Blanchett, Steven Spielberg,
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:57.760]   Oprah Winfrey, Meryl Streep, Daniel Day, Lewis, Martin Scorsese, all tweeted. And they use the
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:03.680]   exact same phrase, the greatest screen performance in the history of the cinematic medium, which
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:09.200]   sounds like it was somehow a concerted behind the scenes campaign. A little, little, little bit.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:12.720]   There were also viewing parties, which is the thing that I like, which is like Jennifer Anderson
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.600]   says, you can come over to your house if you watch this movie that nobody saw, and then vote for the
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:24.080]   star of it. But it worked. It worked. It's a big deal. Yeah. And we have to remember that Kate
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:30.560]   Blanchett was promoting something that's someone who's competing with her. Like she's she's up for an
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:36.480]   Oscar for that. That's interesting for talk. Actually, yeah. For talk. I thought you should get an Oscar
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:40.480]   for the trailer for dark, but I was like, I'm not watching that. Like, that's too stuff like
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.520]   too dark for me. Oh, I was too dark.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.960]   You're kind of for me. I was like, it's not my movie. I need anything.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:56.800]   Raspro did get a best actress nomination for this tiny film thanks to Twitter. I mean,
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:02.240]   Twitter still has cloud cloud and power. It's kind of amazing. Snubs for other.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:12.400]   What we thought were shoe ins, including Viola Davis, who everybody thought would for sure get
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:21.600]   an nomination. Anyway, interesting, interesting. That's the Oscar news. Apple has done something,
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:28.560]   I think, wonderful on the 40th anniversary of the computer. No one could afford the Lisa,
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:33.440]   which came out one year before the Mac was $10,000. I remember pressing my nose
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:39.440]   against the glass of the computer store saying, I want, I want, I had no idea Mac was in the
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:45.040]   in the works, but I couldn't afford it. Lisa, they have worked with the Computer History Museum to
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:53.040]   release the source code. If you go to computer history.org, the the entire source code for Lisa's
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:50:03.200]   operating system and applications software is online, which is pretty, pretty cool. You can't
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.360]   redistribute it. Apple is very clear about the license and so forth, but you can read it.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:13.200]   It includes a lot of Pascal and some assembly. Yeah, there's some assembler. It's pretty neat.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:22.000]   Did you look at it, Andy? I did look at it and it's nice to see and it's not just the
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:29.360]   code that's there, but it's also like every module has like a comment that like the unit
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.240]   Twiggy by Dave often, and it's like everybody gets their own little credit, their own little bow.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:39.280]   And it's this is part of the history that I think that has to be maintained, especially
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.080]   especially when you have something as old as the Lisa where there's no there's no commercial secrets
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:50.640]   inside here. It's good that this be in a depository that be open source so that people who are trying
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:56.080]   to figure out what programming was like, what it was like to create such a transformative operating
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:02.000]   system as a consumer, even though a consumer business piece of hardware, what was that like?
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.360]   What sacrifices did they have to make to deal with the hardware? A lot of times you get explanations
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.160]   of my God, why did that company make such a stupid decision? Should have been obvious that
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:15.520]   they should have done this. And then you look at the source code and you realize that, oh,
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.640]   they were working under this limitation where they couldn't possibly have done it that way.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.880]   Maybe it's not so much that they were idiots or that they were under budget, but so much as
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:28.960]   they were they were limited by the hardware they're running on or what their compiler could do.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:33.520]   So yeah, I think that's exceptionally good. It's open source, but of course you can't do
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.320]   derivative projects. It would be lovely if someone could do a really good native Lisa emulator or
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:47.520]   an open source native Lisa emulator because honestly, there's no bigger apple geek than me
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:53.680]   than I am. But it was only last year that I used a working Lisa for the very first time.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:52:00.080]   Oh, wow. And that's cool. You can read about you can read about this stuff. You can even see like
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.840]   videos and stuff like that. But it's only until you have that mouse in your hand, that keyboard,
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:09.200]   when you try to do stuff and you realize that, wow, this really as revolutionary as it was,
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:14.240]   it really had severe limitations. This would have been such a huge pain in the butt to work with
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.880]   compared with a text interface, which was blazingly fast and efficient compared to all this sort of
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:24.320]   stuff. So it's really important that if we're going to keep this history alive, we're going to be
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.640]   able if other generations are going to be able to be able to learn from what a previous society
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:33.120]   was able to build, then they're going to have to be able to actually use the thing that people
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:39.920]   were using. So it's similar for games too, where just as we don't have it's no problem to see
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:46.320]   Casablanca now. And so we could continue to reevaluate it in modern context. But the game that everybody
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:53.040]   was playing like in 1983, 1984, or even like eight years ago, once they turn off the game servers for
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:57.920]   the Marvel Avengers game, no one will be able to play it anymore. And we won't be able to tell the
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.800]   story about what this story was like and how it affected people who were using it. So I think
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:06.720]   this is super great. It's pretty cool. Yeah, I'm hoping that, you know, the 40th anniversary of the
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:13.760]   Mac is coming next year. I'm hoping that Apple will maybe continue doing this sort of thing where
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:18.560]   it's contributing to history and giving people access to this now that it's sort of not a commercial
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:26.160]   concern anymore. I do have two tidbits from the source code because no, no, big secrets in there.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:32.640]   My friend James Thompson, developer of PCAL points out that he and this shows you what is on James's
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:37.520]   mind. He immediately searched and found 11 in currencies of the F word in the source code.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:44.160]   And it's not source code if there is no if there's no F words in the in the comments, you go.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:50.080]   And an amazing thing that was found. I want to read this verbatim. Welcome to the All Create
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.480]   Preferences window. Through the extensive use of hallucinogens, I have found truth and beauty.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:01.040]   However, these same hallucinogens have made me incapable of getting to Dodge Ridge to sell
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:04.160]   reclaimed ski wax in the parking lot. What?
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:09.200]   Dodge Ridge, Dodge Ridge ski area near where I grew up actually. And
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.800]   go, I mean, it was the 80s. I don't know what to tell you.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:18.480]   I don't know either. Wow. You guys have combed through this a little more than the.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:22.560]   But yeah, look for the look for the F words in the source code. That's a pro tip.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.280]   That's the point. Yeah. It's really cool to look at it.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.320]   We'd be great. Love it. I wish you a license archive.com to do a web based
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:35.680]   Lisa. Yeah. Yeah. I would love there to be a and there may there may yet be, right? I mean,
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.680]   the license here allows you to do stuff like that. You just can't turn into a commercial product.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:45.520]   But if this would help, my guess is that the real way you emulate a Lisa is that somebody's got a
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:49.920]   you know, a binary somewhere where they dumped the ROMs and they dumped a disk image and all of that.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.880]   But having the source code is delightful and it leads to the possibility that somebody could,
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:59.600]   you know, fix bugs in the Lisa source code and release a new version of the OS.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.400]   It happened for Apple to ProDOS. So it can happen for Lisa.
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.240]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. What else?
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:08.800]   Finally get the twig drive working. Yeah. Here's the twiggy code that you're talking about by
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.640]   Dave off and this. It's kind of fun to look at this stuff. I do wish there were more comments.
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:18.960]   There's there's some, but it'd be nice to have a little more.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.280]   It's great. It's great. The explanation. I have heard stories about how, oh, they'll never release
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.360]   the source code to whatever because it's got something copyrighted. If there's a licensing
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:31.040]   hang up or something like that. And this gives me a lot of hope that that's not true.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.480]   And I think it's the computer museum, computer history museum is such a great partner here
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:40.640]   because it allows like Apple's never going to do this on its own. And Apple does have like
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:46.640]   historians on staff and they do have archives. But the history museum is like not only a vehicle
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:52.560]   for these sorts of releases, but also sort of an impetus and an enabler. And you know, I don't
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.200]   think on its own Apple is ever going to look backward. And that's another Steve Jobs cultural
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:03.920]   thing that they put in the DNA there. But they do still have these things that are their property.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.520]   And after a certain point, getting them out and letting them be public is really a good thing to
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.840]   do. So I'm very glad that they seem to be building a good relationship with the computer history
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:19.200]   museum. Maybe this is the way that other that old Apple to stuff and the old Mac stuff eventually
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:24.240]   sees the light of day. I do think it's hysterical that in the zip files are DS store files.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.880]   They didn't expregate those and they are dated March 2020. So they've been working on this
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:37.120]   for some time. But those pandemic project. Yeah, somebody's pandemic project. Exactly.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.200]   It's really fun to know that this is out here. Yeah, I think the for instance, Microsoft will
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.680]   never release source code for Windows because there it is so encumbered. There's so many
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:52.080]   third party libraries and things in there that they don't control the source. And I think to some
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:59.040]   degree companies are are touchy about the code because they don't want the F words in there.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.400]   The hallucinogens and stuff like that. So good on Apple for not being so touchy about that.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.960]   The last thing you want is to be sued by somebody who bought a company who bought a company who
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:15.040]   bought a company that whose assets are worthless. But you just posted their source code and the
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.000]   patents will expire, right? But it's still it's a it's an open question. And companies end up
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.160]   being risk averse. So maybe computer history museum here, you know, actually went through and made
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:28.800]   sure that it was going to be okay. And they they released it. It's not on Apple servers. Apple is
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.120]   not doing any of that. But it's good. It's great news. I'm so happy that they did it.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:39.040]   It was one of the things I think that helped operating system development in general was that
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:45.360]   the original Unix operating source code operating system source code for Unix six was released
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:53.200]   with a commentary by John Lyons in 1976. I think a lot of people, certainly Apple people who did
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:58.160]   operating system development had read that I have a copy of it. It's kind of a classic.
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:03.840]   And it really tells you a lot about what an operating system has to be and what it's required.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:09.360]   And it was well commented and really and fairly easy to read because it's old. It's from the 70s.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:15.680]   So I think Apple doing the same thing for a decade later. Bravo. Keep doing it.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.520]   Keep releasing this stuff. It was commonly according to Wikipedia,
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:26.880]   Lyons commentary on the Unix operating system was the most copied book in computer science.
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:34.080]   As it should be, you know, really, really, you can still buy it. I got a copy of my shelf.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:40.720]   Fascining to read. All right, let's take a little tiny break and then come back with your picks of
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:47.520]   the week as we continue with Mac break weekly. Hey, everybody, Leo LaPorte here. I am the
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:53.200]   founder and one of the hosts at the Twitch podcast network. I want to talk to you a little bit about
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:58.720]   what we do here at Twitch because I think it's unique. And I think for anybody who is
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:06.960]   bringing a product or a service to a tech audience, you need to know about what we do here at
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:14.560]   Twitch. We've built an amazing audience of engaged, intelligent, affluent listeners who listen to us
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:20.640]   and trust us when we recommend a product. Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:26.320]   community of tech enthusiasts. But already you should be your ears should be perking up at that
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:31.440]   because highly engaged is good for you. Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for,
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:36.400]   this is the place. We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.360]   technology in today's world. And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:47.920]   comes from our advertisers. We are very careful. We pick advertisers with great products, great
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:56.720]   services with integrity and introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm.
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:02.560]   And that makes our host red ads different from anything else you can buy. We are literally bringing
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:09.760]   you to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement. We like to create
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:15.760]   partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long run, long term partners that
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:22.640]   want to grow with us. And we have so many great success stories. Tim Broome, who founded ITProTV
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:29.360]   in 2013, started advertising with us on day one has been with us ever since. He said, quote,
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:34.960]   we would not be where we are today without the Twit network. I think the proof is in the pudding.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:40.240]   Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible that have been with us for more than 10 years,
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:46.880]   they stick around because their ads work. And honestly, isn't that why you're buying advertising?
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:51.760]   You get a lot with Twit. We have a very full service attitude. We almost think of it as
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:58.880]   kind of artisanal advertising, boutique advertising. You'll get a full service continuity team.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.480]   People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support you with everything
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:12.240]   from copywriting to graphic design. So you are not alone in this. We embed our ads into the
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.120]   shows. They're not added later. They're part of the shows. In fact, often,
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.440]   they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying,
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:27.040]   yeah, I love that. Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, man, I really got to buy that.

[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.760]   Our show today as it often is brought to you by our club members. Thank you club
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:57.280]   twit members for all the contributions you make. And I invite the rest of you who are not
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:02.320]   yet club twit members to join. And I want to... Yes, it's seven dollars a month. So we're asking
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:09.600]   you for money. But I think we've made it such a great value that I think it's worth much, much more.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:15.120]   So let me tell you what you get for seven dollars a month or $84 a year. You get
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:19.760]   ad-free versions of all of our shows. We don't need to put ads in the shows for you because you've
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:24.960]   already supported what we're doing. You're helping keep the lights on and the staff employed and
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:29.920]   the shows growing. You also get access to what I think is the most exciting community
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:38.160]   in the world. The club twits discord, a fabulous place to talk about geeky subjects, not just the
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:45.920]   shows as they're going on with featuring animated gifts of all kinds of subjects. That's everything
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.040]   everywhere, all at once, I think. But also, yeah, you could talk about movies in there. You can talk
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:56.560]   about code. You could talk about autos and beer and and and comic books and gaming because we've
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:04.640]   got subjects for everything possible that a geek might be interested in even pets recipes.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:12.400]   So I think this is a great place to hang. I keep the discord open day and night. I just love hanging
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.640]   out in there. I think you will too. There's also the Twit Plus feed, which features stuff
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:21.600]   that does not necessarily get released to the public. For instance, our hands on Macintosh show,
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:28.080]   which Mike Asargent helms, Paul Therat's hands on Windows show. We got the untitled Linux show,
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:33.520]   the Giz Fizz. We do events coming up February 9th, win two Dow from all about Android. It'll do a
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:38.960]   fireside chat. Samable Sammett coming up in March. And we're going to interview, I'm going to interview
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:45.840]   Daniel Suarez for a special triangulation. Daniel's new book is coming out. Critical mass.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:52.480]   It's going to be great. We love the its predecessor Delta V. So Daniel will join us and it'll be a
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:56.880]   special discussion in the club that club members can participate in. We will release that to
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:02.160]   the world later. In fact, I think a segment will appear on Ask the Tech guys that Sunday and then
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:06.080]   we'll put it out in the triangulation. But that's what happened with this week in space too. The club
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:11.040]   members paid for it. We were able to launch it there. And as it grew and gained an audience,
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:14.400]   we were able to get advertising for it. So we were able to put it out in public. In fact,
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:19.920]   they're going video pretty soon as they continue to grow. So the club is where new ideas start.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:24.800]   It's a great way to support what we do. It really helps us out. I would, you know, our,
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:31.520]   at least in my, our dream is to, to get, you know, 5% of people who listen, that's all 5% of people
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:37.520]   listen to our shows to become club members. That would really kind of take the burden off of
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:42.640]   advertising and, and let us do a whole lot more. So why don't you join that group?
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:49.120]   Twit.tv/clubtwit. It's, it really helps us out a lot. And I think it's, there's a lot of
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:54.480]   benefits to it as well. Oh, they now have video on the entitled Linux show. Thank you, Patrick. See,
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:02.320]   there it goes. You could find me into club. All right, pick of the week time. And let's start with
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:08.240]   Jason Snell's pick of the week. All right. I mean, big news this week. All the Twitter clients are
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:14.080]   dead officially, officially, and, but well, let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the nice
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:20.400]   thing, which is that has rushed into production, a new app from tapots, the makers of tweetbot,
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:26.320]   a very, very popular third party Twitter client, and the new app is called ivory. It is a Mastodon
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:31.680]   client, a beautiful one from the makers of one of the best, if not the best Twitter clients out
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:37.280]   there. It's iOS only for now, iOS and iPadOS coming to the Mac at some point here, but they got this
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:43.440]   out now because quite frankly, they need to start building a new business because their old business
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:49.200]   is gone. And it's great. I've been beta testing it for a few weeks. It is so well done. So if
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:53.920]   you're on Mastodon and you're using an iPhone or an iPad, give it a try. It is a subscription thing
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:57.920]   because they are trying to make money. This is how they stay in business. There's a seven day free
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:03.600]   trial though, and there's also like a test mode. I did the $25 for a year. That's kind of support
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:08.400]   these guys 15 for a year. And if you want to get extras extra extras, you can give them a little
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.880]   more money. And yet to support some really great third party software developers who are now
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:18.800]   building an app that is not going to be reliant on the whims of a giant service like the Twitter
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:25.120]   apps were. So ivory, it's really well done. Like the fit and finish. And I think they're almost
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:29.200]   embarrassed by it because they've rushed it into production. And it's obviously based on the source
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:33.520]   code of Tweetbot, but then they've really kind of merged it and changed it and done a bunch of
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:37.680]   new things with it. And I think they feel like it's too rough and it's missing features and all that.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:44.320]   And sure, I mean, I guess, but what's there is very, very good. And so although they're saying
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:49.360]   it's like early access, and they're definitely going to add more features to it, I think it is my
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:54.320]   preferred way to use Mastodon right now. And if you're into Mastodon, check out ivory.
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:58.640]   One of the things is cool about Mastodon. We have our own Mastodon instance, by the way,
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:04.080]   which Jason's on Twitter. Social. One of the things is cool about Mastodons because it's based on
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:10.800]   activity pub, which is an open standard itself is open. There are a lot of third party Mastodon
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:15.840]   clients, some very good ones. Actually, I've been including meta text, which I have been using on
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:22.880]   iOS up to now. But that's all right. Don't worry about it. But I think this, of course,
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.520]   everybody loves. I'm so interested to see all the activity on Mastodon for people saying,
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:34.480]   Oh, it's out now I can use Mastodon. It's like, okay, if that's what it took, I'm happy. It's nice.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:40.400]   It's there's missing some features that other clients have. But yeah, I'll be using it. I think
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.800]   it looks pretty good. I'm going to be that guy and say, I think it's the best Mastodon client I've
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:49.600]   seen. And I, I, when I keep hearing about these Mastodon clients, the people recommend to me,
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.480]   it feels to me like people are setting the bar way too low. Like I feel like the Twitter clients
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:58.800]   Twitter, if it can tweet bot really set the bar high. And I think Mastodon has spent the last
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.120]   few years sort of like desperate to have apps that work on Mastodon. And I think we are past
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:09.280]   that point now where everybody needs to up their game. Good. Yeah, meta text is great. Unfortunately,
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.600]   the developer has stopped development on that one. So I've been looking for a replacement.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.160]   I've been using ice cubes, which is another new iOS app is pretty sweet. They're, I mean,
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:23.280]   there's literally a dozen of them if you search for Mastodon on the app store. But of course,
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:28.000]   these guys at tap bots, nobody, nobody knows how to make soft one. A thousand flowers bloom,
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.960]   but you're right. Yeah, I think these guys are just, they're so good at it. Do you think Twitter
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:38.560]  ific, you know, Paul Haddad and the Twitterific folks at Icon Factory both are saying, you know,
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:44.240]   this took us completely off guard. They're begging people do not ask for a refund. We will,
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:48.720]   we'll go out of business if everybody asks for a refund. We're sorry this happened. This
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:54.240]   Twitter gave us no warning and pulled the plug. And I'm glad that tap bots is moving forward
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:56.800]   with this. And I hope that Icon Factory does too. Yeah.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:01.760]   What it sounds like Icon Factory, and I know Andy is going to talk about Icon Factory here in a
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:07.040]   moment, just a little, a little preview for his pick. But I, it sounds like they, I mean, they,
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.720]   they invented so much of Twitter, right? They did the words tweet. They, Twitter,
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:15.920]   bluebird started it all. Yeah. The whole, you know, they popularized the service in the early days.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:21.440]   I think they feel so burned by this. And yet they're also, I think, intrigued about the possibilities
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:26.240]   of the Fediverse. I think what's clear is that they have not rushed in to making a Mastodon
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.440]   knockoff of Twitterific. And, and Craig Hockenberry, who started Twitterific,
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:36.240]   said he's really interested in the whole idea of the broader Fediverse. So I wonder if they want
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:41.200]   to do something that is not as focused on just Mastodon, but that will let you suck in
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:46.480]   information from all sorts of different federated sources, and then also post to different sources.
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.840]   It maybe have a little more, take a little more time and come up with a little more,
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:54.400]   you know, a different take on it. I'd love that. But I would love to see it because Twitterific
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:59.120]   has been my go to Twitter app and one of my most used apps for the last decade. And I miss it
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:03.120]   already. So I hope they do something. Yeah. I've really, it's nice because TapBot's,
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:08.240]   Paul, I guess knew this was coming. So he's been working on it for a lot longer. And it's,
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:12.960]   it's pretty polished. It's very close to done. So I'm glad he's. So it was for a while it was under
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:16.880]   a test flight, but it is now you can just, it's hard to find in the store. It's in the store.
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:23.760]   Well, the Apple's Apple search index takes a while to update across everything. So direct links
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:29.680]   will get you there now. And eventually it'll show up in search. Go to tapbots.com and you can get
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.800]   it from there. That's what I ended up doing. It'll link you over. So go on your, you know,
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:39.440]   go on your phone so far at tapbots.com and go from there. Eventually it'll show up and,
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:44.480]   and a good thing. Very happy. And they're also on, they're on their own
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:50.160]   Mastodon server at TapBot's.social. It's at ivory at TapBot's.social. It's really interesting to
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:53.120]   watch what's happening. The growth of Mastodon's is kind of amazing.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:13:01.600]   As we've had a Mastodon since for three years and all of a sudden, whoa, whoa. Andy, you wanted
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:07.760]   to talk a little bit about Twitterific folks, the icon factory folks. Yeah, absolutely,
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:13.040]   because I had the exact same sort of reaction that Jason did that. Twitter apps, this is one of
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:22.160]   the places where the app, the app studios in the Apple universe are some of the most creative,
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:28.560]   insightful, elegant and artistic app studios out there. I mean, they're not just, hey, let's,
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.360]   we do a stroll. Well, let's just put a scrolling list into a view. When you tap an item in the
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:39.040]   list, you open an expanded view, boom, done ship it, charge 10 bucks for it. They really find elegance
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:45.840]   and purpose to every single thing they do. So I was, they had their own post on their own blog about
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:51.680]   same thing. Like, hey, we, we, this took us completely by surprise. We had no idea this is going.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.480]   Twitterific has gone to the great birdhouse in the sky. They said on their blog post and it
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:01.040]   immediately made me figure out, I need to give these people some money for something right now,
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.360]   basically to show them how much I love them. And I was surprised and it was not hard to find
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:11.600]   something to buy. I've made taught a pick of the week a long time ago because it's one of my favorite,
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:18.400]   I probably my only really favorite menu bar app. It is a simple like eight page text notepad that
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.960]   lives inside your inside your menu bar, which means that it's available everywhere and it's
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:30.000]   synced across all of your Mac devices. So it's so many times where you just need to just need to
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.560]   type on someone's going to give you an address over the phone. You just need a text container to type
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:44.320]   that into or you have a or your one of the one of the shows that you do has switched to a zoom ISO.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:48.080]   And now you have to remember code that you type in every single you need to have that.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:55.200]   Well, yeah, it won't it won't auto fill. So I have to like keep it handy. So I because I swear
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:59.200]   the first two times that I was like five minutes late, it was because oh damn it's I know it's an
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:06.560]   email. Oh, it's just it's so clean and so handy. It is no bigger than it has to be,
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.800]   no more complicated than it has to be. And it's free for Macs. The back version,
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:16.960]   which you get through the app store, absolutely free. They charge 20 bucks all in forever for the
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:22.320]   iOS iPad, OS version. And I didn't I never bought it simply because I don't have an iPhone and I
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:25.760]   have an iPad, but I don't use it that way. And of course, like just a few days ago, I of course
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:30.160]   shelled out 20 bucks for the iOS version of Todd, because I wanted to give them some money.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:35.680]   And it is great. As soon as I installed it immediately, like no, you need to you need to
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:40.160]   connect to this you need to use this magic token is like, Oh, I opened the app and now it has all
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:45.920]   of my my eight pages of tote notes. And it's so perfect again, simple, elegant, beautiful.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:49.600]   Can't wait to see what they have going next. They have some other cool apps that that I don't
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:55.440]   have as much experience with as taught. But it's one of those is one of those few app companies where
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:59.040]   whenever they come out with something new, I'm interested in checking up because it's going to
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:06.480]   be something interesting. Todd, but yeah, we had Craig Hockenberry on Tech News Weekly on Thursday,
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:14.080]   Mike interviewed him really interesting guy. And the story is tragic. But I hope that tap bots
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:20.080]   and icon factory and all the other third party developers find a new way forward. And the good
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:25.280]   news is icon factory does have a lot of these great apps. So visit icon factory.com.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:31.440]   Yeah, there are many a sketch app for the iPad is amazing. If you like to draw on your iPad,
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.280]   they have so many apps, it's yeah, throw them some money. Yeah. And they're really, you know,
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:40.400]   they're designers first, as the name might tell you, icon factory. And so all their stuff is gorgeous,
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:46.000]   just gorgeous. Speaking of gorgeous, Alex Lindsey has a pick of the week.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:53.040]   Yeah, so two days left on the affinity sale. So they have a sale that right now that you I think
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:17:00.400]   you can get 40% off. It's $99 total for designer, publisher and photo. And this is what I'm using,
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:03.920]   99% of the time. There are a handful of things in Photoshop that I still go back to because I've
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:09.120]   been using it for 30 years, not because it's not an affinity, but I can't find it. But otherwise,
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:16.800]   I got actually into affinity photo because it had a very rare little thing that I can take
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:22.720]   spherical images and put them into a 360 sphere and be able to paint things out. And the reason for
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:27.840]   that is you're trying to paint tripods out of spherical images. And so I used it. That's how I
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:32.240]   started using it. But now I use it for almost everything. So so when I'm building something,
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:38.000]   when I'm putting something together, I'm using photo mostly. I use a little bit of designer. I
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.320]   haven't needed to publish very many things. So I still, so I don't use publisher as much. But,
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:48.160]   but what I would say is that it's a really solid product. A lot of things about it that are faster
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:55.440]   than Photoshop. And for $99, you're getting three different apps. And it's a, I probably am in photo
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:18:03.120]   at least once a day to do something or to make something work. So it's a great product. And it's
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:08.320]   40% off for the next. And it's not a subscription. It's just a one off $99. And you have,
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:14.160]   this is the second version or whatever. And so I, but I'm a pretty long term user. And I think
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:20.320]   it's worth the. I have to say that bill it to be able to do this on an iPad is fantastic. I mean,
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:25.760]   the iPad, especially even iPad Pro is such a great tool for photographers. And thanks,
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:33.040]   to a few programs with affinity photos, absolutely the Photoshop equivalent. It's pretty amazing.
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:37.280]   Yeah. Yeah, really good. Good. Through January 25th, 40% off.
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.840]   We're supporting some good indie developers here today. I like that. Very nice.
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:50.160]   Thank you, everybody for being here. Jason Snell is at, of course, six colors.com.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:57.440]   Six dollars.com slash six colors.com slash Jason will give you a long list of all the things he does.

[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:09.120]   Always great to be here at the end of a very busy six days of just me and me and a laptop.

[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:19.280]   Well, worse, well, worth reading. And even, I think you even filed while we were doing the show
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:24.320]   today. Oh, Dan did that. Okay. Bye. All right. I like multitask, but not that much.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:30.720]   I like Mike getting a little, a little plug on here. That's nice. Thank you. Thank you for that, Dan.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.240]   How's the baby, by the way? Is he doing, is he doing well? I think so. I mean, we managed to do a
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:40.000]   live stream for an hour yesterday and there was no baby crying in the background. So I mean,
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:45.920]   progress. Good. Good, good, good. You know, watch that live stream as, as Dan and Jason break down
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:53.120]   their reviews of their M2 MacBook Pro and their M2 Mac mini. That's on YouTube. What's the name
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:59.520]   of that YouTube channel? Six dollars. Easy to remember. Yeah. Thank you, sir. Andy, when are you
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:07.120]   going to be on GBH next? This Friday at 1230 in the afternoon, Eastern time, you can go to
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:13.280]   wgphnews.org to listen to it live or later. I believe it's also going to be on the GBA YouTube
[02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:19.040]   channel. So wgphnews on YouTube. And if you're in Boston, head on over to the Boston Public Library
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:23.440]   because we're doing it live in the Boston Public Library studios with this big cafe around it. So
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:31.280]   buy yourself a cup of coffee, a cookie and enjoy. Yay. Enocho.com, I H N A T.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.920]   Just on the street from just on the street from the Apple store.
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:44.720]   And Alex Lindsey, you find him every morning at office hours.global. Every day, it's a new day
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:50.800]   with office hours with new content. You can join the zoom call or just watch their videos on the
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:56.800]   website or on YouTube today. Play off graphics. We were looking at the playoff graphics from the
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:21:00.320]   last couple of weekends and we were kind of breaking it down. So we were kind of talking about what
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:07.040]   it takes to do them, how it works. After one second. And that's funny. I gathered a whole bunch of
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:11.200]   stuff and we barely got through any of it. We were just so many questions and chat. And the thing
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:16.160]   is, is when you know your audience is deep when we went, yeah, I'm not sure what they use here.
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:19.520]   You know, this is the there was an AR thing that was sitting on the on the on the
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:24.320]   there was sitting on the field, you know, one of those new things were the 3D's on the field.
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.720]   And and I'm talking about that and someone in the in the chat goes, yeah, that was a cinema 4D
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.960]   that was driven into a bizarre. Oh my god. Like listed was exactly how how it's actually done. And
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:41.520]   so it's it is a it's a very interesting such an interesting group because, you know, the folks
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:45.200]   in the chat sometimes know more than the panel and the panel is answering all the questions and
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:50.800]   then there's tons of people asking. It's a it's a very organic thing. I am saying we have to say
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:55.920]   that the NFL has has knocked you off the YouTube. Yeah, sure. We knew it would we
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:00.560]   do it. We looked at it. I thought, how did they get away with this? No, we didn't. We didn't get it.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:05.040]   Yeah. So we'll see. We'll see how much we can put back up or we'll put it somewhere somewhere else.
[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:11.680]   Yeah, you got to do a week. Not tell anybody. Yeah. Yeah, you know, and the when we do them,
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:15.280]   we know that we'll get through the live. We just don't know if we'll get through the the post.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:20.240]   And so the and then but tomorrow we've got Gary Trenda from Sound Devices. He
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:24.960]   manages their RF application. So if you're interested in wireless, this is probably one of
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:31.360]   the world experts in wireless mics and wireless transmission is going to be you know, is going to
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.000]   be on the show and answering people's questions about your wireless transmitters. So I'm so
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:43.040]   nice. Very last yesterday was a focus on sales. So they cover all kinds of stuff. I'm speaking
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:48.080]   I'm speaking at the Silicon Valley video thing on on Thursday at the new new conference. And I
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:53.840]   actually going my first time I've been to a conference in a couple years. And but we're going to cover
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:58.320]   that on Friday. So so we're kind of, you know, the gamut of covering the conferences, talking
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:01.920]   about sales, talking about, you know, all those things. So it's good week. And last week you
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:05.840]   talked to Renee Richie about YouTube. So that's a good name was on that's a good
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:12.560]   office hours.global. If you want to hire Alex zero non zero. media, that's his day job.
