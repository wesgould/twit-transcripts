[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.280]   Stop it. He is our he is my Pokemon go sensei and
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.520]   And of course at I'm where calm
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.840]   He's everybody's Pokemon go sensei along with everything else that he writes about
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.600]   Including have you ever done a vector podcast on Pokemon go? I did I did a vector video on it
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.160]   Just last two weeks ago because we got the embargo on the trainer battle
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   So I did a whole how to do oh
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   See it's getting before it came out. Yeah, it's getting to be like that
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.800]   It's getting to be big also with a little bigger. Yeah, it's getting bigger Andy and not go Chicago
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.160]   Normally you have the star who sometimes and now WGBH boss the boss of a big radio. Thank you
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.640]   Hello Andrew good to see you did you see hello apparently and I don't know how they would do this Russia used Pokemon go in
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.560]   2016 for their election propaganda. How would they do that Renee? I don't even know
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:42.080]   Okay, I just did Instagram Facebook and Twitter cute you with their tail. Um, this is this is that report that was that was
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.520]   offered to Congress committed by the Senate intelligence committee
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.480]   links between a YouTube account run by a Russian troll farm and a tumblr post encouraging
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.280]   Pokemon go players to name their Pokemon after police brutality victims. I don't think it worked I
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.520]   Don't think it worked
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.200]   This is whole social networking thing is an experiment that went wrong. We roll back. Can we roll back to friendster?
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.840]   Something something somewhere like terribly terribly wrong
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   But we are here to talk Pokemon go
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.400]   Except in the in the interstices of the actual conversation Apple has announced it's gonna build a campus in Austin
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.760]   It's a great place no
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.480]   No, no, no campus - not just a technical support center
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   Not just a logistics they already have all that stuff there an honest to gosh engineering and all full-on Apple campus
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.980]   Look at look at Apple's distribution this map from core. Oh actually. This is Apple.com
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.800]   Apple's projected US employment by 2022 and
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.680]   Those big dots are more than a thousand or more employees. They keep changing this map Hawaii had three before now
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   It's gone to zero I'd so hey
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.520]   They left they didn't take the climate
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.760]   They went to Alaska. They went to a note. No, nobody's there either
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.480]   Nobody in Maine North Dakota South Dakota. There's a lot of lonely lot of build-up
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.400]   Now this includes retail, so I don't think that that's you know these are headquarter
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   I don't know this isn't I don't think these are there says US employment. I think that's everybody a lot of retail stores that aren't being shown there
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   9,000 people in all 50 states including Hawaii because there is an Apple store there so I
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.960]   Don't know anyway this new campus less than a mile from existing facilities
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:43.360]   133 acres 5,000 employees the capacity to grow to 15,000 which may makes Apple the largest private employer in Austin
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.840]   Where was the beauty pageant? I missed the entire beauty pageant. Yeah, that's what Amazon did
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.200]   Yeah, I mean it was supposed to be weeks of entry goes supposed to be like the amazing race but campuses
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.160]   It's only it's almost as if like Apple had no like business use for all the data about city
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.800]   Infrastructure that they could collect oh by making every basically making every major city open up their books to them. Oh
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.960]   But that but that's just cynical for me. I'm sure he's here's retail. This is retail
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.000]   So there's a lot of there's a lot of there. We go. Oh, why he's back. Thank goodness wise back as is Alaska
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   Montana so sorry
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.800]   With the code is South Dakota. There's no Apple store there
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.160]   You know every every it's like rate. It's like the new radio shack every town should have an Apple store
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.480]   Yeah, next every Starbucks. Yeah
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:42.280]   Apple is trying to figure out what it's gonna do China has banned all but the iOS 12 iPhones
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   Thanks to the Qualcomm lawsuit one way to do this
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.880]   an
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.280]   Increase I don't understand how this will do it you can explain it to me in pegatron iPhone assembly to skirt China band
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.720]   Is pegatron outside China? This the whole thing is so
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.480]   It's pegatron. I don't know because they're all tier one base, but they manufacture a lot in Sanjian
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.200]   I think but it's so weird
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.880]   It's a it's a Qualcomm patent but for software and software updates can get around the patent because it's really a software
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.440]   Pat so they're just eventually the patch the patch would would change this
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.320]   Yeah, I mean there are rumors that were rushing out the patch this week just to according to the Nikkei Asian review and
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.720]   documents they saw iPhones produced by pegatron are exempt from the band whereas phones sourced from Foxconn and Wistron are blocked
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:40.360]   Apparently pegatron pays a license fee for soft for the software Apple uses that's Qualcomm's asserting
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   They own and Foxconn and Wistron don't I even know that was possible
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.000]   Apple is a lawyer today on Bloomberg. He was he was dapper and he had the best name ever. What was that?
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:59.280]   I was like paddy is robust or some amazing like young adult novel and a double-check it some amazing young adult novel name
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   What did he say he say?
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.640]   Even we lawyers can't figure this he just he just said it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo to distract from the fact that they had
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   No case and that they were abusing friend and they all the same things like the basic thought he was not a lawyer for Apple
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.400]   It was a lawyer for Apple manufacturers who was one and not very happy and it seems like this is all getting caught up in the
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.480]   Trade was all about the trade war. Yeah, it's just tit for tat. It's a retaliation
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.960]   Bostress Jr. Sorry Theodore Bostress Jr. That's a good name. You're right
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.760]   Dick Van Dyke's name and shitty shitty bang
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:42.400]   pegatron is also looking about looking at moving some of its iPhone production to Indonesia and that's about tariffs right that's what happened to my
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.600]   E-bike where my E-bike go sit here somewhere
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.480]   It took me months to get it because they had to move their production to Germany from the US because they had a
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.920]   $300,000 bill for the motors they had imported
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.800]   From China that due to the new 25% tariff
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:06.200]   This is this is typical what's going on so many industries related to tech and even something even not related to tech
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:13.080]   They can't make the plans they thought that they could make five years out are now inoperative because now they have to have a plan
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.880]   Whatever plan B and plan B. They say had before now. They have to have a plan B prime a plan C prime
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.120]   I talked to someone that was a couple months ago
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:30.480]   That was like we literally have three books on the shelf one is if one is if Trump gets thrown out of office
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.800]   Before the end of his term one before if he does not get reelected
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:43.200]   But a Democrat takes over one is if a Republican takes over and all with sub issues on basically what happens with the
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:49.560]   With tariffs and relationship with China and a lot of it is really long-term stuff not just oh boy
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.360]   Oh, thank goodness the tariff war is over now. We can go back to business as usual
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.680]   We're seeing them saying well, let's move both let's start relationships with other chains
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:05.040]   Let's make sure that we now have alternatives to go to whereas we thought that this line was absolutely rock solid
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.840]   Now we have to realize that we're building on sand and we have to be able to we have to be able to move the caravan whenever we need to
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.200]   Now Qualcomm's going back to China. They said oh that worked. Let's see if we could take advantage of this
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.880]   Political situation to get the 10s 10s max and the 10r band
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.920]   Financial time says Qualcomm's asking courts in China to ban the latest models
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.600]   We plan to use the same patents to file suit against the three new iPhone iPhone models
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.680]   It'll be it'll be interesting that that's kind of it's kind of sleazy to take advantage of a political situation - I
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.760]   wonder whether
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.320]   At some point this this becomes there's a there's a possible future 10 years out that that has like when we say what happened to Qualcomm
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.200]   Like what where did they go?
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.360]   Well, and it was like well they picked a fight with one of their largest suppliers or what largest clients, you know
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.880]   And you know Apple is slowly working them out. You know a lot of people are working them out
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.920]   I think a lot of people are you know that this push that their the Qualcomm's doing could end up
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.680]   You know doing them a lot of damage in the long term. I was trying to figure out why countries
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   Yeah, right. I was trying to figure out why my iPhone got 12.1.2
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.760]   But my iPad did not it's still at 12.1.1
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.440]   There's two reasons one because the eSim had a bug that they enabled a 12.1.1
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.280]   But the real but the other reason there's an update on the iPhone is these patents yep
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.960]   This is
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   this is an attempt
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.080]   to
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.280]   Address the three patents in the Qualcomm case so that they don't lose the right to sell iPhone
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.280]   This year's iPhones in China or elsewhere
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:50.560]   Benefits me will update every modern iPhone with the push of a Qualcomm says despite the 12.1.2 update Apple continues to violate
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:57.280]   The injunction that would see iPhone sales ban in China Qualcomm believes they're in violation of the court order
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.080]   Even though they haven't been permission given permission to do so. So what a vicious
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.160]   fight is going on you know to Alex's point Qualcomm is a is a silicon vendor and
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.400]   That's not even their main business their main business is patent
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   patent licensing and those two businesses aren't aren't harmonious one patent licensing damages their other business and
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.520]   They've had a lock on a lot of the chipsets because if you wanted to if you wanted to sell phones in America
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.440]   You had to use CDMA because of Verizon and Sprint and that was not the case internationally
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:33.540]   But Qualcomm took an exorbitant tax because of its right to the US market and people like even Samsung who makes their own much better chips
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.360]   Then Qualcomm had to use this will decided it was in their best interest to use Qualcomm chips in the US
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.280]   There's thus bifurcating their phone lines
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.380]   but that's increasingly not going to be the case as you know quark as a
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.260]   Huawei and Samsung and Apple and all these companies start going to their own silicon and now out of their own modems
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.340]   And I think it's really short-sighted of Qualcomm to put
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.980]   The they made a lot of money off of these patents. Yeah, great for them smart business
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.740]   I'm glad they got it
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.460]   But I think tell us this point they could have looked to the very short-term future and seen we can either progress this and try to
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.380]   Gout as much money as we can before we crash and burn or we can do a fair arrangement with all of these companies and all of these
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:15.000]   Territories and make quite a bit of money still going forward for years to come and when you look at Apple opening up
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.740]   Expanding, you know, they're opening up in Austin, but they're also expanding their presence in San Diego
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.380]   They're doing that, you know for some specific reasons, you know, I mean, you know, it would be very convenient if you had
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.180]   I mean, I don't know, you know what Apple's doing there
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.100]   But I but Qualcomm is in San Diego and it would be very convenient in California where there is no
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:39.180]   Non-competes you can start, you know with it with their kind of wallet Apple can start draining their engineering staff
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.940]   You know, and that's something that you know, I know I don't know what Apple's gonna do with it
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.940]   I know that's what I would do with it
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.940]   You guys are suspicious isn't it?
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.100]   If someone if someone if someone played dirty pool with me in China, but wait a minute
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.980]   I would open up and I would try to hire every one of their engineers. I mean, I don't pretend to understand this case
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.980]   I don't know that it's dirty pool
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.620]   Admittedly, it's a political situation
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.100]   Yeah, well, they want they want profits
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.660]   They believe that their component in the phone is so important that they deserve royalties based on the entire phone
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.500]   Not just on their component which we have an apple saying
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.700]   They're not gonna give you one red said either, right?
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.820]   Well, they'll say they'll pay a fair and reasonable amount like based on the based on the cost of the component not on the cost of the
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.860]   Phone and if you think about like like Sony makes a sensor Sony saying cameras are so important to from now
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.780]   We want 20% and the modem wants 20% and the AR technology
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.060]   And pretty soon is 120% of the profits leaving the phone
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.580]   I mean every company has to be reasonable, but the bigger problem is that Qualcomm's patents are again
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.700]   They're eating their business
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.140]   They they don't have the best engineers anymore
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:47.020]   They just announced a new processors and as a generation behind what Apple and Samsung are doing and that's just not in their best interest
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.660]   Either because it's hard enough to have a merchant silicon business
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   But if you're draining it for the patent fights, that's that's just even worse for you in the long run
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:59.580]   Yeah, well, they're they're they're real pro their real product is compatibility the fact that they've got this chip set that
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:06.380]   That works everywhere with every carrier across the world and they have a lot of experience in making sure that these things maintain compatibility
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:15.580]   They also have a lot of experience in fighting to make sure that the standards that are approved are very compatible with what Qualcomm wants to make or what Qualcomm can defend
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:21.060]   So it's not just that it's not just manufacturing capability. It's not just the speed of the processors
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.980]   It's the knowledge that if you put that Q processor that a Q mode inside your device a lot of your problems are solved
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.220]   We see a lot of stories about how Apple and other companies
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.900]   Because they are smart working on their own
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.580]   Their own technology to replace Qualcomm's, but that's gonna have a bunch of growing pains
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.940]   They're really gonna have to have their chips
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:51.300]   Up and working for several years of testing before they would try to put inside something as specific as an iPhone
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:58.500]   The Apple you know that you know what kind of disruption it takes when you find out that on one carrier in one country
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.100]   With one that that an iPhone is now not working or it's not getting the the promised speeds
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.180]   That's almost a crisis point
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.800]   Imagine how bad it would be to say that well so long as you're not in a zone that has both
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.740]   5g and LTE at the same time on a tower that has a common misconfiguration on it
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.100]   You will get good speeds otherwise enjoy your haze robotic 1200 modem speeds
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.540]   So that's that's really what they're selling but your but Renee is absolutely right there real
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:33.540]   I think they're playing their hands way too great too hard. This could be I have heard of companies in the past
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.380]   Essentially being as smart as Renee is saying saying that well
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.420]   We know that we only have a few more years in which we can make money off of this
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.580]   So let's just let's just smash open as many piggy banks as possible
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.460]   And if it if it involves holding people's feet to the fire and people basically holding companies products hostage
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.180]   We're gonna have to do that
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.220]   But the Lord knows that they're their business transitioning into
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   wearable to wearable processors is not doing that great
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:07.100]   Because they are building chips for almost a dying range of mobile of wearable devices right now
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.660]   So they're gonna have their so maybe they really are in this sort of drastic
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:16.860]   Let's get as much money in the kitty so we can we can ease out the coming storm when I believe that they're really can't afford to make those
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.340]   Watch chips like that's the reason like the reason they have bad watch ships is because they reused an old chip
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:26.100]   And now they're reusing the reused old chip because they don't have enough money to invest in new chips
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.980]   And a lot of that I think goes because is because of the way that they're draining their coffers to these patent flights
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:36.220]   Well, and I think that I believe that the SEC is is is investigate them under the frand
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.140]   Requirements and if if they lose that then all of this goes away like it, you know, it's it's a devastating
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:50.380]   I I'm not thrilled by Apple's choice of Intel modems either in its devices, which are worse than the Qualcomm
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.540]   chips, so
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.540]   That hurts consumers doesn't it?
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:02.740]   Yeah, once once again, that's a big it's not it's not a third rail that it would be a very very big step from a disabled
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.740]   We're going to go with a less compatible modem than the industry standard so
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:17.100]   It's a you know these things nobody wins unfortunately they're expensive and drawn out and I'm sure both sides feel like they have a case
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.580]   Here they wouldn't be pursuing it. It is a shame that it got caught up in the trade war
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.100]   right
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:31.220]   Both more importantly both sides feel as though they have a very deep financial interest to keep this fight going rather than to find a point
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.740]   In which to settle this this isn't like Microsoft Apple from years ago
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.300]   Where each had something that the other wanted or needed and so they could come they could come back and say Apple
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.180]   You can help us out a lot with this antitrust thing
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:49.460]   We're going through with with with with with the government Apple said you could really help us maintain credibility
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.760]   If you were to pledge support for the mag for the next few years
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.220]   Qualcomm Apple does not have anything like that going on it really is you're holding you are
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.660]   Qualcomm saying basically thinking of that Apple is the key to the continued success of the company
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.020]   They needed those taps of money to keep on going Apple is saying you are holding us up
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.060]   You're charging us money that we don't think we need to pay
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.420]   This is not going to end except in fire
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.240]   Although Qualcomm chips are using every other phone except apples phones
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.800]   Right in the US, but they're not you internationally like here in is used in Huawei and Exynos is
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.260]   Yeah, they're using in jurisdictions where you need CDMA, right? Is that the reason? Yes? Yeah?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260]   Yeah
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.140]   Yeah, and because
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.820]   No, but I also Verizon and Sprint didn't switch to HSPA like every other
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:41.860]   Performers like in Canada Bell and tell us switch to HSPA because they wanted to get on the LTE train to the ignorant observer
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.340]   And I'll count myself as that it looks a lot like what Apple did to Adobe. Okay fine
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.620]   Make our own right right and Apple is kind of notorious for that. Okay fine
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.940]   They're they can afford to be they have the money but the other side of that coin is that Qualcomm?
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.500]   Usually in these types of arrangements you say I'm gonna our tech fine
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.260]   We'll allow your technology to be the basis for something so important as
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.140]   Interoperable network communications for the upcoming wireless standard
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.180]   But at the same time you have to agree to then license those patents freely
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:21.220]   Reasonably and non-discriminatory and that's the part that's under litigation a good template for that is what Apple does with arm
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   Because apples chips are based on arm chips just as Qualcomm's chips are and that apparently is a happy relationship for both parties
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.020]   And arm doesn't say you have to give us 20% of the entire phone because we're so important
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.220]   We make the entire phone work right one
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.060]   And I think that a lot of this fight is also building up towards the modems that we're using in the future will be 5g
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.380]   And you know
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.700]   I think Apple's trying to make a decision about what they're gonna use to make their own they want to make their own and and
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.380]   I'm surprised that they haven't made their own
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.460]   I mean given how much money they're making and how long they've been doing it
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.300]   Doesn't it kind of surprises me. They haven't internalized these capacities earlier
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:21:00.580]   But that's interesting. Yeah, yeah, I mean on a device that's as small as an iPhone
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:07.340]   Would Apple be willing to have their own 5g chipset, but then use someone else's chipset for 4g and LTE?
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:15.460]   As as opposed to here is one package that will deliver everything including future compatibility with a with rootwear upgrades
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:22.980]   and this is Apple is in a good position because they could build all of this themselves the problem is that
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:31.060]   The reason the reason why Android is the de facto operating system for mobile is that all these other companies don't have the resources to build
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.340]   Their own operating system if someone offers them something off the shelf that can be modified
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.820]   They'll definitely gonna take it
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.500]   But right there is gonna be a point at which Qualcomm is not gonna be able to keep holding at these people up to these things
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   especially if Apple
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.740]   If Apple really wanted to poison the milk what they could do is essentially
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:56.740]   Have their researchers build their own sort of solution to this problem and then open source it or that or
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:03.300]   Offer it as just basically say we we feel as though compatibility of phones for everybody helps everybody
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:10.500]   And so we're taking these these 900 million dollars for the research we did and the chip fab the templates
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.300]   We'll give you samples. We'll send people out to your factories to help you make these things
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.740]   all because we want phones to be compatible and the
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.300]   And the tricky part of that is that you know that's what they a lot of what was being pushed for vp 9
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.180]   You know and a lot of the other things that google was doing because google and facebook and other books don't want to pay h2
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.180]   60, you know, and they don't want to pay for the
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.260]   Ampegg la
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.500]   Ampegg la for all the rights and so they want to open source something then you end up in legal battles because
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.380]   They're saying that the open source stuff is of course based on the
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.540]   All av1 now. Alex that's gonna save us so quarkam
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:49.540]   Interestingly has 15 percent of the 5g patents out there. They're not it's not over when cdma goes away
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.940]   And one of the drafting 6g already
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.780]   Yeah, and one of the big issues is going to be that qual as you know the qualcom is
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.900]   Broadcom's trying to buy qualcom. They're a singapore
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.740]   company
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.820]   uh, and the big concern in the united states is that china will have the bulk of
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:09.700]   5g patents remember we're trying to you know the administration
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.780]   Trying to keep people from using wahweigh gear
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:20.340]   uh zte gear no kia has 11 percent erics and 8 percent qualcom 15 percent and so there's some fear that if a singapore company acquires
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.700]   qualcom
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.860]   That there's more patents that are going out of the us
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:29.380]   I was always surprised apple didn't buy in finion and let intel buy them because if any one was the original modem maker and if apple did
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.260]   Want to be in that business that would have given them several years of a head start
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:38.420]   All right, this is cynical, but maybe apple made the decision. It's cheaper to cheaper to fight this in court than to buy in finion
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.860]   Maybe maybe it seems like that's in their wheelhouse though. I mean that was the thought when it started
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:51.060]   Right, it hasn't really hasn't stayed cheaper. Yeah. Yeah, maybe they thought that would be that's just a problem with court, you know
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:58.980]   It's always it's a crapshoot. You don't know what the results are gonna be and and so for a nail and closer kingdom and and the thing is
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.380]   lawyers
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.260]   This is all coming from my personal experience now lawyers always overestimate your chances
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.500]   But it's a but but they don't tell you underestimate no matter what we estimate
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:17.300]   It's it's really somewhat random and you go into court and then there could be a trade war and then china can rule against you and then you're screwed
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.260]   So it's it's really unpredictable and this is why
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:25.140]   It instead of making that calculus. Oh, let's not buy a finion. Let's just sue
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:32.980]   In my opinion, I would tell my kids this the bet that whatever you could do to stay out of the legal system
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.620]   Oh, yeah, whether it's robbing liquor stores or suing Qualcomm do I
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.020]   My you know, I come from a family of lawyers and and that's the same thing
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.060]   Oh, yeah, do not do everything you can to you know avoid that until until you have to it'll chew you up
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.060]   Oh, yeah, sometimes you have to sometimes there's no recourse and I understand that as well
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.100]   but uh
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.100]   but but you can never make a
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.020]   logical or
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.260]   Rational decision about what's gonna happen because you just don't know and then there's juries
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.900]   Oh
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.980]   I'm telling you my new philosophy get people out of the equation. It's all I
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.580]   I've got I've got a plan. I got a plan to play a game
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.660]   It's in short. Let go and let google just let go and let google okay
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.260]   Um
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.540]   I know you don't like I know people are not gonna like this plan, but it's a good plan
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.740]   Google you know, that's an imaginary plan to play your life
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.980]   Well, it doesn't have to be google, but it it has to be somebody with advanced
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.700]   Machine learning technology
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.740]   I feel like google's pretty much the lead in the forefront of that, but but whoever is whoever's best
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.060]   I yeah, I'm they're innocuous. They can't do any harm anymore
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.660]   Yeah, except you know, they're finding out the Watson really isn't that smart
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:50.740]   Do the best you can see they now they are the machinery that the people who the consultants who control the decision-making
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   Process of the world. They are basically the gears of that thought process
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.540]   So well, that's the so I think a lot of times we focus i'll talk more about this tomorrow and twig
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.180]   I think that's where i'm gonna i'm gonna debut my new political plan leash it unleash it, but
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.220]   we often
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.300]   Because of science fiction think when we're talking artificial intelligence, we're thinking robo cop we're thinking
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:17.060]   uh, you know human thinking machines that's not what we're talking about really machine learning is
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.100]   the humans set the the criteria and the standards and the and the training sets
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.380]   uh
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.180]   And and so what we have to do is do that right and then let the machines take
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.740]   And if you look at something like gerrymandering is a good example of something where you go shouldn't a machine do that
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.780]   A machine should definitely do that. We set the rules we say here's what we want
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.860]   We want equitable distribution of votes or whatever
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.540]   Mostly that we want we just want to start at the bottom corner. We want to go this way
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.140]   We want to go on a fight equally in a machine. We do a better job. Just go machines do a better job driving cars machines
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.220]   Now it's early days. So Watson didn't do so well in medicine
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:57.300]   But that doesn't mean it won't in time right humans will determine what are the outcomes we want
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.780]   And then let the machine do it our mistake is humans determine what are the outcomes we want
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.980]   And then we try to do it and we screw it up every freaking time
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.980]   Well, the machine is going to think we're a bunch of idiots and then clams. Oh, that's the AI
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.820]   That's the old robo cop thing. They're not smart. That's not the issue. It's machine learning human rules
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.060]   But they're going to do it rationally. They're going to drive a car rationally. They're going to
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.340]   Well gerrymandered rationally. They're going to make rationally. And then my iPhone will have more question mark as a text entry from a month
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:30.500]   Believe it even not to turn this into another 45 minute brad hole on something that's that's painfully interesting
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:37.780]   But not macro not apple related. But yeah, I mean so it's always going to be about what instructions do the humans give the machines
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:45.540]   And so when it comes to gerrymandering, it's what what if if you want to make sure that every community within a group has a political voice
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.980]   do you
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.140]   Arrange the district so that
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:57.940]   I vote alongside the 5000 people who live closest to me or is it because here is we have figured we have determined that here is
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.940]   Andi naught goes political thought we are going to give him sort of a virtual
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:08.660]   Congressional district that represents people who think like him so that they're congressperson
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.380]   They will have elected congressperson who reflects their ideals or their beliefs
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.340]   it's the only the only problem is when you when you
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:23.220]   When you gerrymandered based on a result that you that you want to create or basically when you want to disenfranchise people
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.420]   But on the others but when even when you're trying to do it honestly
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.740]   There is no one great solution and it's always going to be pretty pretty flawful
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:37.460]   Right, but that's where the debate should happen rather than right let it in and I believe california is largely driven computer driven for the
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.740]   For it's good. It's good. The truth is we're going there. It doesn't matter what you and I say it's going to happen
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.740]   But it's just no in a hand basket. I agree
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.540]   No, it's going there. All right, letting humans run the show has been a vast
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.140]   Horrible mistake. I'm just saying let's give ducks a chance
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:29:03.380]   Hey public service announcement apple offering free next day delivery, but you've got to order by December 21st
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:09.220]   That's friday. It's case you wondering but that means if you order by friday you'll get it in time for christmas
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.420]   I bought I actually bought it a couple of iPads for the christmas season
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:20.580]   It is much less stressful when you just go to the when you order it on on apple dot com and then you just go to the apple store
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.700]   And they just you know I ended up buying it from amazon because they had $50 off and I got it the
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.300]   Entry level ipad for 279. I thought that was a very good price
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:34.180]   My problem has always been that that I never got every time I bought from I bought a bunch of computers from amazon in the early days
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.740]   And I just couldn't get the apple care to work correctly like it
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:41.300]   They never registered the way it's supposed to and then I was like apple anymore. Why should they make it easy?
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.700]   So when you buy it on you buy it at the apple store it just works and then i'm just like
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.500]   Our show today brought to you by brr x the first corporate credit card for startups
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.420]   This is something anybody who runs a business needs to know about we just set up our bracks account. It's so cool first of all it's easy
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.060]   Five minutes you do it online
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.900]   Here's the thing you're gonna like as a startup or a business owner the underwriting is based on
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.780]   cash flow the cash raised by your business
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.940]   Not your personal credit it doesn't require a credit score a social security number
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.180]   Doesn't even require a security deposit
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:23.620]   And because of that they can offer your company 10 to 20 time higher limits than other corporate credit cards with no personal liability
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.740]   Plus brex is designed for business. So they give you
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.180]   rewards tailored for modern businesses
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.540]   For instance double points on software
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.820]   Triple points on restaurants and travel
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.260]   What is seven septuple points
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.100]   Is that right seven septuple points on rideshare?
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.140]   So when you when you take a lift you get seven times the points. I love it and and
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.700]   There's no limit on how many points you can earn and
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.020]   Points can be redeemed for statement credit on transactions
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.140]   It's money in your pocket
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.260]   Plus they've got great offers with some of the best technology brands and services
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.620]   People that you use like AWS or or google or you know, we're a google or g suite
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.220]   Company we'd save on our g suite salesforce. We work
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:17.860]   Brex underwrites your company not used so there's no minimum operating history. It's great for startups
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:23.460]   There's no painful paper application and again, I'm gonna say it again because it's so it's so important to me
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:28.820]   No personal liability required. It is a visa card. It's a real credit card. I'm not saying it's not a real credit card
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.740]   It's fast though. You can instantly issue virtual cards to your employees set limits control spend
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.940]   You could do it in real time. You've got your your console sets real time limits
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.900]   You also then get a physical credit card in the mail really quickly shortly thereafter
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.780]   I loved this the first time I used the Brex credit was awesome. I used it at a restaurant
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.100]   And I got a text immediately saying oh, we see you just charged something
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.420]   Take a picture of the receipt
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:02.020]   I said oh, okay, so I did responded to the text with a picture of the receipt. They said great. We've got that categorized
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   It's in your quick books. Thank you
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.580]   Throw away the receipt. You don't need it anymore. I
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.940]   Love that you get complete statement descriptions that clearly tell you what you've spent on it
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.260]   Of course, not just quick books. It integrates with all the major accounting
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:22.180]   Programs we use quick books. That's that's why I mentioned it join the thousands of startups and tech companies who use Brex to manage their growing business needs
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.500]   and earn valuable rewards by doing so get the card free and

[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.140]   For not only for their support but for making the best possible business card. I love it
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:50.740]   So by the way, uh nine to five, uh, mac had the story this week that apple is in fact working on custom modems for iphones
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.380]   Yep, so that's uh, you know, not not a surprise
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.020]   In fact for years. Yeah, they've been poaching employees from qualcom
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.180]   For a while and we're attempting to according to the information
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.660]   Let's give let's give credit where credits do because I love the information and just renewed my subscription
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.460]   They had some great articles this you're so smart
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.260]   Yeah anonymous sources familiar with a silly emotum plans that this is indeed an active
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.980]   project
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.660]   Apple an apple made cellular modem could take as long as three years to land on an iphone
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:28.980]   I think because we've heard that apple is going to put off 5g till 2020, which is completely reasonable given the state of 5g
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:35.620]   That's probably when you do it right not this this year, but maybe nixx. G. Maybe six g or wait till six
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:40.580]   When is six 2025 they're drafting it now. Are they jeez Louise? Yeah
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.940]   You can get five so veris is doing its own version of 5g. I'm working where else right?
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.740]   It's not just like standard and then and then who was it?
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:56.340]   AT&T just announced that they're offering residential 5g in about 12 cities. I think I think that that happens this
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.180]   Friday. Yeah, you get a special little 5g modem you put in your window
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:05.300]   And uh verizon is writing down oath so it can afford 5g and 18
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:11.140]   Is buying time Warner's or can't afford 5g. It's obviously you see where we are into years 5g will happen though, right?
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.180]   I mean, it's not yes
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:16.340]   It just depends it's always who can build out the most infrastructure the best the fastest
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.980]   Who ends up having a good network for the first couple of years?
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:26.900]   And it also depends on how they how they can sell it to people and make them realize that they're doing that they're they're buying something that's valuable to them
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.060]   Which is going to be a harder sell than LTE was
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.140]   Do you consider group FaceTime calls unrealistic?
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.940]   No
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:42.180]   uh according to uh apple insider apple is working to make them more realistic the audio in the calls
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:47.060]   Uh, they're processing they want to implement the cocktail party effect
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.900]   To make it easier to talk
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:56.100]   We actually use this and we use something similar to this not exactly it's spatial
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.700]   It's spatial rendering so you know where the voice is coming so a lot of times for
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.020]   some of our
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.940]   Folks what we'll do is um if you have
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.460]   Comms and stereo in your ears. We will move like your clients will be over in the right
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.180]   Other people will be over in the left some people will be in the center
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:18.100]   And so by having three or four positions or five positions of where people are that are talking to you
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.380]   You know who's talking to you because you might have hundreds of people on a comms
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:27.140]   Um from different groups and you kind of get it you get and after a couple hours you get kind of used to knowing where everybody is
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.220]   And so it it actually makes a lot of sense
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.500]   And it sounds like it actually is paying attention to where you're looking
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:38.820]   So um, you know from from looking at that so it it it's less crazy than it then it looks when you read the article
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.980]   Okay
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.260]   There's a lot of technology for basically identifying specific voices within one single voice track
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.740]   And then being able to sort of isolate one and give it more prominence to the others
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.580]   Uh, and that would be that would be a pretty big thing like every every time uh
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:36:00.100]   Uh before uh before our show there might be a couple of interesting conversations happening at the same time
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.900]   One of which being like my conversation with with the producers about okay. So is the lighting okay now?
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.100]   Okay, can you hear me now?
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:14.500]   Uh, damn. Okay. What if I unplug and re-plug in and meanwhile like you guys can't really have their your conversation because it's all
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.580]   It's all being much together
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:22.260]   Uh, but to be able to put multiple conversations that are of interest to one specific listener on the same channel
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.860]   Wouldn't just create a wonderful experience for that one person
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.260]   It would also actually greatly enhance what you can do with one single channel of audio
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.300]   And if you think about it, this is actually what people with hearing aids have problems with is that everybody sounds this at the same level
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:41.140]   So they have a hard time they hear everything kind of together. So this is modern hearing aids are supposed to do directional stuff
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.820]   Right. Yeah, but it's it's the same kind of thing where you're gonna if you're talking to someone you kind of turn
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.380]   To the way you're gonna hear my modern hearing aids are somewhere with my air pods if anybody sees
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.260]   Oh, no
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.740]   Oh, no
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.180]   You found please and I bet you your modern hearing aids cost a lot more than the air pods
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:00.020]   A lot more although I am on my third set of air pods. So it's it's starting up. Yeah, it's catching up
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:05.060]   Uh nik d in our chat room who was just in studio and then his whole group had to leave their visiting
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.780]   Uh says we are now using facetime more than skype for business. It beats skype for business in every way
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.900]   That's an interesting unexpected side effect of that
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.740]   I think that I find that uh
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.380]   FaceTime is more stable than many of the other platforms
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.340]   But it's also a little bit a notch lower in quality oftentimes and so um, but it works better
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.420]   You know, I should start using it
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.260]   We bought a mac mini just for that purpose. It won't it's not it
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:35.140]   When you have good bandwidth, uh, it's gonna look better on skype than it does on facetime. Oh interesting. Look and sound better. Oh interesting
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:39.620]   Um, uh, at least that's been our experience. Um, yeah, we just bought the big skype tx box
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:46.580]   So I'm not sure I want to switch to facetime, but yeah, no, this I have a skype. I want a band in skype god knows
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.980]   Yes, but it's the best
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.860]   Nothing out there
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.420]   The thing that it does better than than all the other platforms is it will suck up as much bandwidth as you right of it
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.820]   But the problem with all of our hosts like rene and andi have lost a bandwidth and so they do
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.180]   They they almost always look great if yeah, if there are other issues
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:10.340]   Right, the hard part is that skype doesn't handle variations in the bandwidth nearly as well because it's using up so much of it
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.780]   So if it suddenly drops, you start to break up pretty quickly. That's what we notice
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.140]   Yeah, and so um, but it uh, this is obviously something we have to
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.060]   I've had to do hundreds of events with uh, and uh with all the different platforms
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:27.380]   And so it so we prefer we have about four or five of those skype boxes because of that because it's it is still going to look the best
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.460]   um, there's
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.460]   Unfortunately, the skype tx boxes are
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.900]   Mostly done, you know, so what do you mean done like it's over? No, no, they're mostly they're mostly complete
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.340]   They're not quite oh, yeah, we have we have actually a really nice one
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.100]   They but it has an audio bug. It's not in production yet. We're still using what's
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.980]   In which audio bug are you having?
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.900]   Because I can tell you which one you have you have it wait, wait, we're talking with our engineers
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:55.300]   I don't know you have a you have the new tech skype box. Yep. It's the vs 400
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.540]   Yep, and it's losing sync. Yep. Nope. Um or drop
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.620]   Yeah, it's Carson says yes
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:06.100]   So the only way to keep sync on Alex would know more because he's been working with those so the dontay protocol
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.620]   Distortion issues and is that coming out of the analog?
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.180]   The return audio so it's not for us, but it would be for Andy and Renee
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:20.020]   Are you feeding it? Uh, are you feeding it Dante or using Dante to transport it what live wire?
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.860]   Oh, I've never used live wire. So we use it's apparently a live wire bug or bug interaction
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.580]   The problem is that the the the skype tx box
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.020]   99 of the users use it with sdi
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:37.060]   So if you if you de embed and embed the sdi signals it works perfectly because that's what everybody does
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:43.300]   If you use the Dante the analog the anything else you're in this like tiny little percentage that they never test and they and you
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.260]   You know, we're working with them to make it work and it will work you will make it work
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.980]   No, we're working with them and then they're gonna fix the bug right it's actually a nice relationship
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.940]   We have new tech is very responsive. It's just a matter of having a we've always
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.660]   You know, we've used new tech here since the very earliest days. So they're the best of the skype tx boxes
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.900]   We could we test it all of them. That's the one. They're the best ones. We have five of them nice
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.620]   Okay, getting but getting back to uh
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.620]   Yeah
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.940]   I'm just saying to just point out a problem that apple's gonna have going forward that
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.180]   you can it's
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.500]   It people can prefer it to skype
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.380]   But the great thing about skype is that it works on damn near everything
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.940]   And are you gonna force people to this is a this is the greatest communication platform
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.820]   You can possibly have provided that everybody in your entire network is using apple devices
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.180]   And given how much of a push that putting into video now
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:42.900]   Uh, their their video streaming service can they continue to say that this is going to be the greatest video streaming service
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.780]   Well, we're developing and putting all kinds of money into all kinds of deals for all kinds of amazing content
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:53.300]   And unless you have an apple streaming device that really has absolutely no advantage over
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:59.540]   Any other box that costs a third as much you won't be able to watch any of it is it's
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.180]   They have to really start to think about the
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.340]   Depending on what their plans are they're gonna have to start thinking about becoming a mat multi platform company
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.260]   If they really want to achieve what they seem to want to achieve here
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.500]   I don't think the thing is is that you can have a really good business with a very small percentage
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:19.140]   I don't think that they need it. Um, I think that the the dealing with the multi platform issues
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.020]   We deal with a lot of the multi platform issues on a lot of these things and
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.820]   It's just easier when it's all on the same platform
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.500]   And I think that apple is not gonna I don't I'd be blown away if apple really gets into
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.220]   Any more multi platform than they already are doing
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.660]   Um, you know, because I don't think that you know, you can have a small percentage
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.940]   I mean a very successful car company might have six or eight percent of the market
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.860]   You know, it's doesn't it doesn't need
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:45.140]   They don't need to have 40 or 50 percent of the market. Um, they get they can have you know 10 percent or five percent of the market
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.420]   That's very happy
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:51.540]   Well, but the the ironic your customer your customer isn't one person by one car for themselves
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.180]   The the the custom is a group of people that are trying to work together
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.740]   and so
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.540]   At what point does an incident this is great for families?
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:09.460]   But what happens when our institutions more likely to say that we have to reject this out of hand because we can't simply
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:15.460]   We can't tell somebody who needs to be in on this conversation that you can't you have to go to the apple store
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.940]   And put the cone of silence over you and one of those demo iPads
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:25.060]   Because this is not going to our company solution or our group organization solution doesn't work with apple
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.900]   And this is a conversation we've had been talking about some video streaming before
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.540]   It's but how
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:37.940]   Prominent can they be if they're creating culture that can only be appreciated by people who are buying
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:44.420]   Uh, really expensive electronics. Oh, but I look at like it's I think I think they're pushing they're pushing the easy button
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.820]   I think that I think that I think that I think they're gonna continue to push the easy button
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.020]   I mean you look at like for me
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:55.860]   I would not give my kids anything other than an iPhone because because I I do all the little gifts and the little things and I do
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:01.220]   I do, you know, FaceTime and I do all these other things. I'm not gonna, uh, you know, I'm giving them older my older phones
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.780]   But they um, you know
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:08.900]   So that's not just one person that's a whole family deciding that we're all going to be iPhone because I don't want to deal with
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:15.300]   Trying to show them how to do anything cross-part. I'm a face be I run old family. I'm giving everybody Facebook portals for
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.260]   The terrible problem with FaceTime is that
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:24.660]   Everyone remembers that steve jobs wanted to open source it because it was a wonderful beautiful peer-to-peer technology
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.900]   And then they rapidly told him, uh, that's nice. D. We didn't build it that way and oh, by the way
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:34.340]   Verde mex is now suing us 19 different ways from sunset what happened and we're having to rearchitect it through relay servers
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.780]   So now this beautiful peer-to-peer dream that would have been so easy to open source
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:42.020]   Uh, we're gonna add a billion people going through our servers every day for absolutely no money
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.420]   Cross-platform and services two things we do so well. Uh, no
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.500]   Oh, so now we know what happened. I didn't realize all of that was apple's not good at it
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.500]   I mean any any cross-platform
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.140]   And there's no business model because they have to literally take a billion
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:03.220]   Potentially a billion extra customers onto relay servers to work around this patent that they've been litigating for eight years now. She's
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.100]   Again with the patents
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:12.100]   Here's a surprise by the rocket rocket so much. Here's a surprise. You can now play your apple music on your amazon echo
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.220]   How did that happen?
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:20.180]   There's something going on between those two that's gonna that's got a herd of all the pod sales, right?
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.220]   It's well that division has also also
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.980]   Oh, so i'm sorry. Go ahead. I have a mirror. I think no
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.700]   I was just gonna say that apple music has a very different mandate
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:34.420]   It's been available on androids since day one and apple could have very easily canceled the android app when they took over
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:39.380]   But they want they they prioritize family plans and they realize that not everyone in the family has an iPhone
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.220]   And not everyone in the family has a home pod and it provides greater value to the families
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.300]   If they if you can buy the subscription and then play it on anything you happen to have
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:53.380]   We just we just we just responded to that by saying Alex said i give everybody an iPhone in my family
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.140]   That way it all works, but this is a paid service. This is not like
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.180]   Those things are free. This is a paid service and that's a very easy business model to just
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.740]   And right now i have i have an
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.060]   Yeah, you know in the in the kitchen we have an a echo show or whatever and
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:16.420]   Um, my wife and my kids use it almost constantly and we use i have amazon music because or i have prime or whatever that
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:21.140]   That's why that's the other step i pay for that just for that echo because because of the echo amazon
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.380]   I have an amazon lemon because of our echoes
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.220]   It's mostly so my daughter when we make breakfast my daughter can want me to say play pearl jam and then i just place both
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.700]   So i'm so who gave in on this one
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.820]   Amazon a good deal for selling amazon
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.260]   Well, it's both they got a deal amazon is selling apple stuff again
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.620]   And apple gets to push apple music more which is for some sometimes you it's like sometimes you want to have
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.660]   Services that help you lock people to your hardware
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.140]   And sometimes you want to have services that create their own business and when you have paid services
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.460]   Those are the easiest to sort of see as their own businesses
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.020]   It's it's much more doubtful that people people will say they'll pay 10 bucks a month for i message your face time
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:59.700]   But they won't but they will pay 10 bucks a month for music and probably for television
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.420]   You know what music no longer will have remember ping
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.140]   apple music a couple things on ping
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:13.620]   I was excited for photons apple music connect seems to be going the way of ping now apple has
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:20.020]   Started telling apple music artists. It's removing the ability for those artists to post content to connect
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.180]   and
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.980]   Previously posted content is being removed from the for you section and artist page is an apple music
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:31.460]   Uh, this is the announcement artists are receiving according to nine and five mac
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.620]   We've made a few changes to apple music. We'd like to tell there's probably like six independent artists
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.340]   They're like I can't believe they did this to me. I know no one else is so pissed
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:44.500]   No one else is today. We're streaming music discovery. We're streamlining music discovery by removing connect posts
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.700]   streamlining streamlining it so
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.780]   This is nobody's using it. They don't want to nobody's using it. They don't care about it
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.500]   Yeah, it's like google plus i used it here's where i use it
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.300]   And i think it's still doing it it's part of my recommendations engine right those artists
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.100]   It was never going to work unless apple literally paid a marketing person to be with every musician
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.540]   For several hours a day using it on their behalf. It was never going to
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.900]   Attain any serious traction with artists. They'd rather use twitter
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:17.700]   This was also also this was a this was a really wonderful deal for artists in which they get to create exclusive content for apple music
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.860]   Without getting any benefit from it
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:26.100]   But pomacardi and emistone created some music it's a anti-bullying
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.980]   video
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.140]   from macartian stone
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.540]   Which is an interesting
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.740]   pair
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.740]   Everyone did something once leo. Yeah
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:41.780]   It's from his a 2018 album egypt station. It's an apple music exclusive
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.580]   They were connect curious
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:48.340]   I could just play a little bit of it. Uh, there's paul
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.940]   So
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.460]   I'm watching this video if there are kids being bullied
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.940]   They might just think it's the kind of thing you can just stand up to and laugh off
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.340]   kind of creepy looking
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.180]   Okay
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.940]   That's all I could play because it's not apple music exclusively
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:13.380]   apple has taken three of the 25 spots on ad weeks best ads of 2018
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.900]   I think they should have all 25 of them
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:24.260]   Uh, 30 of them. Yeah, I think one of them of course is their holiday ad which we great which I love which we showed
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:31.300]   The physical the physical models that they built. We're just I wanted as my train set leo. Yeah, so that uh, that is ninth place
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.140]   It's called the share your gifts holiday animation commercial
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.460]   um
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.820]   Although can I can I say that as anybody who's been like a creator for a long time kind of test
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:49.860]   The idea that here are all here's all the artwork that I've done that I decided not to show people here all the the short stories that i've written
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.020]   And poems i've decided not to show people guess what it suddenly all gets blown out
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:58.980]   The window and now it's available to just strangers in the street. You are going to look at it and comment on it
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:07.620]   That that that's like a facebook horror story. Yeah. Oh my god all my private posts under my alias have now been gut tagged bublic. Yeah
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:14.180]   Yeah, poor Sophia, but but good puppets good animation. It's number 19 on the list this ad the one where the
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.820]   girls walk it through her high school
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.900]   Uh locker alley and unlocks her phone with her face ID and then
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:26.260]   unlocks her locker with face ID. I was never sure about this from a security perspective all the
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:35.300]   Her lockers now apple is big. This is like another anti google anti facebook sort of position to take she unlocks everything
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.700]   With yeah, they got that that janitor shurkin fly open when you look at him
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:46.820]   All the school this it's a good ad but you're right. I'm not sure the messaging is exactly what apple
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:51.220]   Like the prom hole and the blood over her something that's
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:56.340]   No, she's stolen as the engineer's package and the very very expensive for the school
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:02.500]   That's all she's letting all the frogs out of their cages and biology class letting the fish out of their oh my god
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.300]   This is now she's fleeing the school. She's trying to get me
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   All because of face ID unlock with a look
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:15.700]   Yeah, even the true in is he locked to the I never understood that. Oh, I guess he just went on lock around his neck
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   What was he locked the other flag?
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.900]   This is doing a very like 1978 sort of style
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:28.660]   This is the highest rated though. I kind of surprised me number two on the list of the top 25 ads
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.380]   For 2018 scott spike jones
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.620]   Homepot ad
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:37.700]   Welcome home. Let me let me put the audio on here if you look at the making of this
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.340]   I mean, I don't think I saw this. Oh my goodness
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.300]   When did this uh come out must have been earlier this year? Yeah, it was more around the homepot times
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.100]   So she's on what on us on the subway
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:54.260]   This is miserable. That's human girl. It's exactly surrounded by human health horrible horrible
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.340]   On inside ai ai will help ai will help come on
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.460]   Let your homepot make your bed
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.860]   So much emptier and look at how many times they edit or don't edit
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:12.180]   Is it a long tracking? She's a lot of tracking shots here. I'm not sure if it's all tracking, but it's there's been there's
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.820]   But when you when it gets going
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.620]   She
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.620]   She feels better now because
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.060]   In her tiny little apartment
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.140]   This is what I this is what happens to every young person who moves to New York city
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:31.140]   So sad except the apartments to half the size. Yeah, this is jones a huge
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.700]   helpful about
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.700]   She's falling asleep
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:40.020]   This is the second best out of the year. This is how I destroyed my my last
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.500]   To the class of my hand, but it wasn't gin and tonic
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:50.180]   It was a bit of clear liquid. Okay. We're telekinesis magic
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:56.500]   Is your apartment gonna get bigger? Oh, it is
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.020]   Thanks to homepot
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.060]   You can have a five thousand dollar New York city flat
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:10.740]   The friends apartment. I haven't seen this one. This is a very long one. There's a number of reasons. Yeah, I haven't seen this one either
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.820]   So
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:18.260]   So that's what's interesting. So this is all my practicals. This is not none of this is CGI
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.340]   It's all done in reality in real
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.700]   That's pretty cool
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:31.540]   I thought I saw this in a way fair
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:37.140]   Need have a number in the lower this order against how the how the value of this property is expanding as they had
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:45.300]   A lot of the still off physical. I know New York City co-op owners often will break into the apartment next door to expand their flats. There you go
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.820]   This is a new way of doing it. It's kind of an ugly flat now though. I gotta say it's a little
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.220]   hallucinogenic
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:59.460]   So if you had hallucinogens would be a great boy who is spike jones. He's not spike Lee. No, no, no
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:05.620]   He's not a lot of great videos. He said he's a music video director. Uh, he well. He's actually a director of musical
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.460]   Go ahead and he sorry he did a great Christopher Walken
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:16.020]   Of a video for a five-boy slim. He is like the goat one of the go-to guys you go to for like a really cool video
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.540]   Do you want to think outside the box?
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:33.300]   Oh, she's created a second person. She's got a doppelganger. Yes, she is going in the mirror with her doppelganger
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.020]   The apartment suddenly is under the tester act
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:43.780]   I think this is what happens when you take loose jens in the New York City subway
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:53.220]   We're still off through about this commercial. This is a very long ad
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.060]   Yeah, it's it this is the long version of it like like there was a long version of show your
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:02.420]   Uh, you know the the holiday one. Yeah, and there was there was definitely like 30 second one minute versions that were
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:08.580]   Yeah, it was disappointed because we showed we showed the long one. Uh, yeah, one does not tell spike jones
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:13.300]   How long is that? Well a lot of times for a lot of these it costs so much money to build it
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:17.780]   It's cheaper to go ahead and you build a big one. That's your whole vision. Yeah, knowing that you're gonna
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:23.540]   I think mostly gonna use 30 second to 60 second version that actually is cool because that was really cool. It's yeah, she uh
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.500]   she was kind of just
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.900]   That's what music does to you in a way, doesn't it?
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:33.860]   Price though, it but how did how did something that was that good and clearly cost that much money
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:39.460]   And i'm a big nerd who's interested in apple and all the and uh, how did I not know that this exists?
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.980]   And I know this could say something bad about me, but that's it's because none of us are watching ads anymore
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.820]   YouTube notifications
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:52.500]   Well, but but I still would have seen this is why ads have changed like that's so good that
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:58.420]   I thought that I would have come across it where someone's talking about it on reddit or someone who's talking about it on an apple board
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.580]   Or or an apple news site
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:05.460]   Uh, I'm I didn't I could I didn't see it so long ago. It was like back in february or something
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.220]   Yeah, but no, but I would have remembered it if had I seen it maybe I don't know maybe
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.460]   Maybe whoever posted it only said oh new apple ad
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:18.180]   Uh, I mean this is this is why you the youtube app is such an important thing
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:23.060]   I see so many really cool ads even though I pay for the no ad version
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:29.380]   Only because like i'm i'm subscribed to like the google channel to google's official channel apple's official channel
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.740]   And so I will see something really really awesome that they just made as a film
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.340]   And knowing that I would then hopefully think highly of the hope
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:40.900]   Google ads in front of the ads that they made they put on youtube and then I just it's just too much
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.900]   It's just too, but do you see the glitter bomb lio have we talked about the glitter bomb? Yeah
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:51.780]   Everybody see I was you know when I saw it this morning. I thought oh, I got to play this and I realized everyone in the world has now seen
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.140]   Mark rovers. I mean I thought it was okay. How did they fall for that?
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:02.020]   Amazon does not ship home pods everybody knows this are these thieves just not thinking they're not smart these thieves they're not smart
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.580]   I thought the I thought the kit was okay. I mean
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:11.380]   He spent he must have spent on god so mark is a former nasa engineer who decided he wanted to thwart
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.980]   The people who steal packages off of his porch
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:22.340]   So he take a home pod case and doctored it to include a centrifugal force glitter bomb
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.660]   By the way, I love the subtitle. Yeah, I know centrifugal force is just a construct
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.580]   A glitter bomb
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:36.980]   That when they open it up it's got four not one on two dot three but four smartphones in it with lte connection
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.940]   So a convideo the person opening it up
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:45.540]   And then it sprays glitter and then he puts fart spray in it which i've never heard of but apparently
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.020]   Is disgusting thought that it was
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:53.700]   Well, but he needed a reason for them to throw the package out the window so he could get it back because it has four
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.420]   phones and he spent six months building this
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:01.860]   Not not only that but it wasn't just let you put a gopro in there. That's like that's like a custom controller board
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:08.660]   That he had it must have cost for it. I don't know roughly two thousand dollars to make this look at that beautiful dispersal. Yeah
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:13.380]   It's clever. You know what he got a lot of gooder at last count
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.020]   He had eight million views on you did well
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.180]   He did well. He did well. He does. I don't know what's eight million views worth two thousand dollars. I don't think so
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.340]   I mean he did well
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.580]   I don't have any videos everybody's like me to views. No, but it's a it's it's a cool thing
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:30.180]   That it's very the thing that was most the thing that was most surprising to me about it is that
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.660]   Like here people who have just like stolen a four hundred dollar thing
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:39.700]   And they've just realized that the thing that they stole was some sort of a bait device
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.820]   That was so elaborately constructed. It probably could not have been done by one person
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:51.140]   This is the sort of thing that maybe as an agency would have put together and their immediate reaction and so many of the video
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.700]   The videos they posted in this video were like oh
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.180]   Oh
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:03.060]   Strange person who owned that house you really got me. Oh, that's just delightful as opposed to oh damn. Oh, damn. Oh, damn
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.820]   I already have warrants. Oh my god. Oh my god. There's probably GPS there. Oh my god
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:12.340]   Actually, yeah, that was what I came away with was that these package seems really you and me
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.500]   They're not like they're not lifetime crooks. They just some it was a
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:23.220]   Operative these boxes back to nice cars. Yeah, and apartments that are look at least okay
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.380]   And a few of them like this woman laughed
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.900]   She thought oh nice job bad guy
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.380]   Uh
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.380]   Contemplates life choices
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.060]   Now I loved it. I thought it was great a huge amount of work
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.300]   I mean in a lot of money thrown into that
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:46.500]   But that's what's great about youtube by the way you might have wondered and it took me a while because uh ad week is a subscription service
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:51.620]   What the number one if if that was the number two ad we just saw for spike jose. What was the number one ad?
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:56.020]   Hmm any thoughts? It's uh the Nike ad
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:04.100]   Featuring uh callin cappernick who has been effectively banned from the nfl because he dared to kneel during the national anthem
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:10.660]   The uh, it's just a poster it says believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything just do it
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.660]   And obviously uh ad week picked it not because of its creative
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:22.020]   But because of what it says, right? I mean this is well because it's genius advertising if you if you support his cause
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:27.540]   You are definitely going to retweet that if you are if you if you are a dope who hates his cause
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:32.260]   You are going to retreat the hell out of that and this is and this is also going to be a news item
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.420]   That's the that the that the media that you did not pay for is going to go
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:42.180]   So it's it's an effective ad definitely, but I'm sure that ad we picked it largely because
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:48.820]   Unlike that home pot ad well wow I can it's a I can't believe I never heard of that and i'm an apple geek
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:57.940]   Like no it was impossible to not know about this ad because they're people who are very emotionally engaged and very emotionally driven to make sure everyone knows
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.180]   That you see this ad
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:05.780]   Interesting but between that glitter bomb and that ad and this one this is a viral ad from uh pop eyes
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:10.580]   You can go to pop eyes and buy a box of chicken that says emotional support chicken
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.460]   On it. Oh you can get it only the airplanes that yeah, it's at the philly airport
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:19.140]   I'm I'd go to pop eyes just to buy that and take it on the plane
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.900]   Kfc has fried chicken flavored
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:28.900]   Fire logs sold out getting so good at hacking our human brains. I'm telling you
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.900]   We
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.300]   We gotta get humans out of the equation
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.580]   No more say no to humans this this fall
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.860]   It's just I'm just telling you this is my
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:47.780]   Pick of the week, you know this is just this is exactly the line of thought that started that winds up with thanos doing what he was going to do
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.700]   Yeah, well that's the other three of us all the fingers
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:56.180]   Uh apple got peanuts, but not for peanuts
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:01.780]   Uh apple has landed right to either uh all of the charlie brown shows
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:06.180]   I went to buy them yesterday on my apple tv
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.820]   $20
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.140]   For a half hour show no rental available
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.340]   $20 yeah
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.780]   They're taking advantage of all the hype leo wait a couple weeks. Yeah, yeah, but who wants to watch a christmas special
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:23.780]   In february or no they just you'll have it ready and waiting
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.740]   New stuff
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.100]   of
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.100]   Oh, I should pull this up. I
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:36.340]   Red nose reindeer. Okay, that's good. That was a good one when it was one of the rank and vast ones or something like that. Yeah
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.260]   Uh
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.780]   Then it really went downhill there was a four package set $20
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:48.100]   And then I thought well, it didn't even include the charlie brown christmas charlotte brown christmas by itself
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.020]   $20
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.260]   Because they have the beetles of christmas specials leo exactly so it's like you get
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.940]   Do you want to see do you want to see bruce spring steam in new live in new york or did you want to see
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.980]   Like the the topless elvis impersonator and performing in the middle of times square
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.420]   Yeah, actually it's just it's like when I think about how much those spring steve tickets were
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.820]   $20 doesn't sound that bad
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.740]   Actually
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:18.020]   This what's great about it though. I was listening this morning on my as it turns out home pod to the soundtrack
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:23.140]   Which has been released of the spring steam broadway show and you can watch it on netflix for free too. So that's good
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:27.060]   That's good. He's making sure everybody everybody gets it. I can't quite fit
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.460]   We don't we don't have all the information but apple seems to be really putting together quite a a
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.420]   Yeah
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.220]   What a good
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.420]   Yeah
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.620]   They got the fast they got the fast and furious director with a justin lyn yesterday too. Yeah
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.780]   I just I just got to say that I don't I don't know what kind of content they're going to create
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:46.980]   I am just so happy that they managed to get peanuts before disney got them
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:52.260]   Because that's a good that would have been horrifying that would have been all my child
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:59.220]   Here it is the original christmas classics you get root off the red nose reindeer. Okay, that's good frosty the snowman. That's good
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.540]   uh, Santa Claus is coming to town and the little drummer boy
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.780]   $20
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.500]   Okay, well, and that's not including a charlie brown christmas. Well, I really want that. Oh, I'm sorry. I was wrong
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.740]   I just want ricki ricki $10
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.100]   $10
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:19.540]   No rental when we were gonna and where were you gonna buy it for less than i'm sure the calculation is where we're gonna buy it
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.420]   As Lisa pointed out immediately you can watch it free on tv
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:28.740]   But with ads and you gotta find it well as not the original you don't get the dolly mattison ads
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.140]   You don't get the puk puk puk puk puk
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:38.900]   You know that you the little spinning special logo used to get it would be cool to get the dolly mattison ads in there actually
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.260]   They should throw that in there should be extras. I got last year
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.300]   I started tradition of hostess brought back like the the zinc now
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:52.020]   Now it was zingers are our hostess brand not a dolly mattison where you couldn't get you couldn't get dolly mattison snack cakes
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.100]   When I was a kid in new england, but now I buy like a three-pack of zingers and they
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.820]   I take it. You know what? This is a better deal than I thought because you get a charlie brown christmas
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:04.260]   It's christmas time again charlie brown the little known
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.500]   sequel
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.940]   And it's flash beagle charlie brown you get all three
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:14.100]   There you go. You get the star wars christmas special because then i'm old if they sold that
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:21.060]   Christmas on cash is lucas own that who owns that? I think the other little charlie didn't you most Lucas own it and buried it
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.420]   Yeah, there's like there's like vhs is floating around of it
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:31.140]   $10 and then the package is 20, but I don't know that seems like a lot
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.100]   From this angle you look like the nfl using their ipads on behind their surfaces
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:40.660]   It's a surface. What are you talking about?
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.780]   Um, yeah, I know isn't that funny
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.940]   Um
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.380]   Elf on the shelf and elf story that's nine dollars. Oh pop at role
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.940]   See he's a deal pups pups save christmas only 899
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:05:00.340]   What about all these that's the real christmas movie which one die hard? That's the real christmas movie. I know
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:03.940]   Oh
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.740]   Anyway, yes, i'm glad that apple got it. That's probably better than uh, then then disney
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:12.260]   They're also as part of the partnership. They also produce a visual
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:18.020]   Sorry, no, I just I just want to throw out there that if we're gonna argue that die hard is a christmas movie
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:18.980]   Which I agree with
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:24.900]   Poseidon adventure if it weren't for that like enormous like steel christmas tree that they were able to like tear down and they
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.700]   Would not have been able to escape the ballroom. So this is I will say the Poseidon adventure all sort christmas movie
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:33.460]   Release the cracking
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.340]   All right, uh
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.940]   Let's see
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.420]   I i'm not gonna comment on me of that apples
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.340]   I have nothing to say apple streaming video service
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.380]   casting director
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.420]   Don't know what that means sony executive tamara hunter
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.060]   after an extensive search
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:06:00.100]   It cast the casting director. They have cast the casting director. You're gonna Alex you're you're you're a medium mobile
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.980]   What the hell is what are they why are they hiring a casting director?
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.620]   That's uh, well casting director does more than just I mean
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:09.300]   It really is reaching out to the right people to bring them in for for shows
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   And so you get a you're working with the producers and the producers are gonna have a show that they want to do
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:18.260]   And then a casting director is gonna go out now. I don't know how I don't really know how a casting director works at that level
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:23.780]   That they're talking about maybe they're gonna maybe they're gonna catch she's gonna cast the this but generally shows they got by
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:29.060]   Yeah, generally the casting director is the one that is casting the roles for all of those all of those shows
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.860]   She's good. She's good. You know, there's a lot
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:36.180]   Um, she's actually head of the sony pictures feature casting division
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.460]   So she's an executive. She probably doesn't do actual casting
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.460]   Remember that it's not just I mean, obviously you get she did all the marvel stuff
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.460]   She did deadpool x-men apocalypse
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.980]   You'll have a handful of people that I mean it is a it is a machine
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.580]   You know, you have a handful of people who are that you know you want in the movie
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.100]   You know, sorry we want robert down in jr
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.300]   We want but remember there are hundreds of people that are that are cast into these things
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:03.060]   And so there's a huge division that's figuring out who every person and generally every speaking role and occasionally some of the
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:10.660]   Non-speaking roles. It's an incredible amount of work to get the right people for every single job and to find the next
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.180]   Breakthroughs, you know to find the next the next people that are going to be
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.740]   um, you know
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.300]   The next Hemworth
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.380]   Chris helmsworth Chris
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:26.180]   Which hemsworth you're gonna cast which bald one brother, but but but you know, it's the cast of the break
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:31.220]   That's the ones that find those people before they you know, it's their first couple movies
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:37.780]   So why isn't apple? I think missed a little bit they could have sold a lot of apple tv's had they announced this last month or at the end of this
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:42.660]   Early I don't think it's anywhere near ready yet. They're still staffing up all the whole app media projects
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:46.020]   They don't have they don't have a product people people are not going to go into best buy and walk up
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.460]   You gotta get the but if you ask it with all the movies and shows, right?
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:56.660]   Yeah, I mean it would it will have it would happen if they if Disney announced that all future star wars content will be direct to
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.060]   we'll have an exclusivity window with
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:03.300]   Of with apple tv or if there were some next season
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.460]   Yeah
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.620]   Yeah, and it's I but I
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:12.260]   I'm not speculating here. I'm legitimately wondering is this
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.540]   Is this a great solution?
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.220]   Our producers going to run into the same problem with apple that they ran
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:25.700]   They're running to with networks where you can't cast a background extra without making sure that some executive at the network approves that
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.780]   Okay, we approve the casting of this person for this non-speaking role
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:36.100]   Is it an extra late or is it the sort of hands-off thing where their her job is to get
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:42.740]   Roundup people and bring them to the attention of producers or suggest people in general it that depends on the
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:46.100]   The leverage that the producer and the director have
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.860]   It's for everybody, you know whether you know if you're a small director and producer then you're gonna be told by the studio
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.460]   What to do if you're a big one you do what you're gonna do, you know
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.940]   And it's but it has it has little to do with the the company paying for it more to do with the
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:04.900]   Those two people and and how much leverage they have because of what the last movie was
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:10.340]   I mean, you know, so some people get carplanche. No one's gonna tell them what to do and no one puts baby in the corner
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.860]   but uh, but the um
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:20.260]   Uh, but but for if you're getting started then you're gonna have a lot less leverage and the the studio is gonna tell you a lot more
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.260]   And oftentimes for your own good
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.700]   It's not always not always a bad thing. They're telling you what to do

[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.260]   Pick the loan you qualify for and boom you're in

[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:32.820]   Then the step two takes kind of kicks in and this is again without in most cases any input on your part

[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:16.420]   Well, I shouldn't say locked it. They can't go up even if rates go up and they probably will but it could go down if rates went down
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:21.940]   Your rate would drop so you win either way. This is exactly why rocket mortgage from quick and loans

[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:54.420]   It isn't just the engine which is blank which is a fork of apples web kit. I should point out
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.140]   Yeah
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.020]   Uh blink is just the engine they're going to do all of chromium
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.900]   And then they're going to contribute back to the chromium open source project
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:06.420]   This means chromium and chrome will be dominant like 90 percent of the market share
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:13.060]   Uh, does this hurt apple is apple? You know the microsoft's justification a was well, why are we developing edge?
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.740]   Nobody's using it
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:20.420]   But b the the world deserves a web standard so you don't get things like else step in the middle of the you know
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   You can test against one browser
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:27.380]   Now I should put out the switch on securities take on this what it what it's swift on securities what did tae tae say
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:34.180]   That this was because electron microsoft is having to bet increasingly on electron apps and the performance is so horrible
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:37.380]   That they feel like if they can instantiate a universal chromium instance
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:41.380]   They can reduce the amount of overhead that each separate electron app. Oh, that does make sense
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.620]   All day every day they got electron when they bought github
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:50.260]   But it makes me want to cry and just make you want to cry electron is a pig because partly because it includes a copy of chromium in every
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.740]   single app
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.740]   I'm near wanting to just drop all electron apps just because they're just so swift that security calls
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:01.060]   electron a cancer
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:11.060]   It's favored like I've talked to a lot of developers who make electron apps and a lot of them because a lot of the tv apps too
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.060]   Like youtube and amazon's prime app
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.100]   They're often open gl or some sort of cross platform mobile app
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:22.180]   And the the users are never happy because the apps never behave the way they expect them to and are always terrible on resources
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:29.300]   And the developers hate them because they end up being fast and cheap instead of being good because the program managers choose fast and cheap over being good
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:33.060]   So they're having this technology that only really appeals to program managers
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:39.700]   And yet is increasingly being pushed across stacks because it's just so easy to do and I think it makes everybody who loves
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.300]   And enjoys native apps and consistent user experience is very very sad
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.300]   Well, but on the other hand if you can create a good looking native app
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.340]   In javascript with progressive web apps
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:56.020]   This he links by the way, sootun security is currently corn fact on twitter
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.940]   He links back to a post earlier this year
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.460]   uh
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.220]   From shan larkin
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:09.620]   That all of office 365 almost finished is completely rewritten in javascript and skype and teams and
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.340]   microsoft's code
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.420]   Studio code and all of ms edge dev debug protocol
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.660]   Javascript
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.140]   And there's nobody would have picked if they knew this was its future
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:26.740]   Well, they had no yeah, but on the other hand it is cross platform and and it could conceivably give if you had the right
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.780]   Service workers and engines like electronic could conceivably give you desktop performance
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:37.140]   Uh, but but they're cross platform. It's you know what this is microsoft acknowledging and I think this is true
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.460]   And here's the question for you mac panel
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.620]   Microsoft saying
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.860]   Operating systems are dead. It's all in the cloud. Nobody cares what operating system
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:51.700]   They're using if anything the browser is the operating system who cares about operating systems. I think it's good for example
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.220]   Is that good for apple?
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.620]   Yeah, because they're gonna keep on building native apps. They're gonna keep on having
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:59.140]   The OS you say and so there's a there's a there's you know
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.580]   It's not a minority
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:05.700]   But it's still a great minority that's never gonna go over there because it just keeps on that that world over there keeps on getting worse
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:10.340]   You know and so that's you know and so there you know, it's it solidifying apples position
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.660]   in in where they're at and so it's not gonna
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:15.300]   The apple will still stay a small small percentage
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:20.980]   But it it's better for them because there's there's more people that will go over to the other side and immediately want to come back because they're
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.180]   Everybody's lowest common denominating everything other than apple
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.620]   Uh, I don't know if I agree with that
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.340]   chiefly because people
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:35.780]   Where we are not the average user not geeky users the average user just going this isn't worth it
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:41.140]   No, I'm I'm speaking about the average user that only cares that they open a window and they get microsoft word
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:46.100]   And the finer finer points of it the fact that the there's an underlying architecture the superior
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:50.100]   They're not gonna care about that the fact that a dropdown renders a little bit more fluidly
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.940]   They're not gonna notice poor care
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:56.420]   They are gonna they are gonna use an app that works for them that is very very functional
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:01.860]   And they don't really care about the noise that the door makes on a car when you shut it
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.700]   That does it shut? Yes. Does it latch? Yes? Does it lock? Yes? Is it reliable? Yes?
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.380]   I don't care that it makes a katit thunk instead of a thunk noise
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.780]   uh, the fact that
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.380]   You can build it
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:20.900]   It's not necessarily that a browser is an operating system, but a browser is a targeted development platform now that a lot of people
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.540]   Don't especially on mobile devices. Don't care so much about the apps they use as long as they
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:30.340]   Can access it throughout whatever browser they have they're not gonna really appreciate
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:37.940]   The fine points of the user interface that you can get when you create a native app for that's targeted exactly for one platform
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.620]   Uh, and also, uh, it's one platform for debugging
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.460]   It means so it means that the $200 device is gonna work near
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.620]   I can get the same app for the $200 devices
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:52.180]   I can for the $2,000 device, which is not appropriate for all apps and all tasks
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.100]   But it is appropriate for most of the things that most of the people are going to use
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:59.380]   And finally the the the bad news I think is that
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:03.380]   If you are in Microsoft's case if you're standardizing on
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:09.460]   JavaScript, you have just expanded the pool of talent you can draw on for development worldwide
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.820]   By by an order of magnitude, I think so it means that you don't you don't necessarily have to
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.260]   If you're if you're looking for someone to build a mac app you are
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.020]   Getting from a talent pool of people who've learned a specific skill
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:27.700]   If you're getting from people who just need to know how to uh, how do we use japa script and can be trained up on a certain framework
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.940]   That's not that that's not that's not a bad way to extend what you're doing
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:37.540]   I think the ironic thing is that the mobile stuff is the one still getting native apps because they're so resource constrained and so
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:41.300]   Performance sensitive that they're getting native cocoa apps. They're getting native windows app
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.820]   It's a desktop the legacy desktop that everybody's abandoning that nobody wants to say
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:52.500]   Here's the world here's the world that microsoft certainly and in and google certainly less so apple envision is progressive web apps where
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:57.300]   It's kind of going back to the original steve jobs idea. You don't have standalone dedicated
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:03.300]   Apps you have apps that are really just web pages that turn into apps when you download them sweet solutions
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.820]   Uh
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:11.300]   It is an advantage in the long run if we can get the service workers and everything and apple has apple's gonna be faced with an interesting choice
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.940]   Because as more and more apps are written in this way
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:18.980]   Uh, they're gonna have to decide uh, how much support they want to put in do they want to be
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:25.380]   Tick-tick chunk company. No, they're gonna support it because they didn't want to because like it apple has a native platform
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.540]   Google didn't have a native platform. They had a mobile one but not a traditional desktop system and
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:33.300]   And when microsoft had windows so they didn't need to be as fast as google either
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:39.780]   Google desperately needed this because this is the future of their technology stack and apple's being drug previously kicking and screaming and now i guess
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.100]   Sort of like
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.820]   Service workers anyway, they put service workers in a couple of ios's ago or something. I mean it's
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:51.780]   They just they always will lag in performance, but i'll get to a certain point where the lag is acceptable
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:59.380]   For some, you know, I think that I still think is a highly lucrative small percentage of people that do care about how the door shuts and do care about how
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.420]   How smooth it is and do care about that thing and that's that's I think the market that apple is is working on
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.300]   They'll use bb edit instead of word because it runs beautifully
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:14.500]   Interesting. I mean if you look at you may not have a choice in and years to come if you look at it may not have a choice
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.580]   If you go to you know large
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:23.460]   Companies large technology companies and you look at how many pcs they have versus how many max they're using
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:29.780]   It's almost all mac like you know like you know like that's more about reliability though. It is not a tick tick chug
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.260]   That's well, no, it's about reliability. It's also about that if they're security the users are given
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.100]   But a lot of the use most of those users are given the opportunity they can get whatever computers
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.380]   They're a lot to choose all that all of them then it's about marketing
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:46.100]   Yeah, I mean are they are they making a value proposition or are they reacting to the fact that
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.620]   Apple is the luxury brand we we
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:54.740]   I'll take it. Well previously previously you could run windows and unix on it and that was unique
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:21:00.580]   But now microsoft is embracing unix. So yeah, I have to say this is one advantage one reason most programmers still use max
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:07.300]   Linux for windows the links for windows subsystem is not even close to what apple offers with its command line apple has a real
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:14.500]   Unix command line and that is a huge advantage of your program you could literally boot into all three os's on one machine
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.580]   It was a big advantage. Yeah
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.460]   And that's again is slice. It's a thin slice
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:25.060]   Five or ten percent. It's a lot. It's a lot of it's business. It's certainly a business. There's no doubt about that
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.660]   Uh, I wonder though
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:34.100]   I mean isn't apple facing this issue of platform and an operating system and how do we how do we transition to ios from
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.860]   Who is fully doing it? They're doing it, but doesn't this help them
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:45.140]   If platform I mean it's I clear the future of the world users don't care at what operating
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.620]   I mean arm arm has a javascript accelerator in it, which is ridiculously fast
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:54.100]   I mean not arm but apple's a series chip has a ridiculously fast javascript accelerator on it
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.260]   That's the approach to take
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.220]   Optimize
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.300]   Well, they're slowly slowly moving a lot of people over the you know, the rumors are that the
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:05.540]   A lot of their, um, you know, IBM partnerships and everything else have been very very
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:10.260]   Good for apple, you know as far as you know, you look at sales staffs that are getting, you know, I pass
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.260]   I'm with you. I I I I like to chug chunk, but uh
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:18.580]   There there may not be a world for a total of that. Oh, there's
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.860]   You know, I'm just I'm just I'm just spelt to take chunk
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.300]   crisis, the show notes
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:29.300]   And again, and this is and this is an argument supporting crap
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:35.860]   This is an argument supporting that you have to give people things that are actually valuable to them and not simply
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:39.700]   Conceptually valuable and the fact that something might have not such
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.580]   I mean, there's there there you can you can
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:48.500]   There the two ways to improve a burger are too. Well, we use this we have this herd of cattle
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.300]   It's only fed grass, but the special grass blend and we prepare it like this
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:58.340]   We season it like this we age the beef before we do this another way is to put lots of salt and carbs in it
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.340]   Because
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:03.060]   I put lots of onion powder in it because people will like it
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.900]   And so you could argue that it's a better burger one way or another
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.180]   But if you put two on a plate and say here is where here is a
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:16.020]   We're here's your up your two upgrade options from the 99 cent value meal mcdonald's cheeseburger
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:21.140]   Here is a $8.00 $9 burger from a very very nice local cafe
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:25.940]   Versus here is the $28 burger from the steakhouse chopped house
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.740]   A lot of people are going to say if you're going to have to pay for it
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:34.900]   I would much rather have the i've rest i'd much rather have the $8 burger and two or three beers then
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:37.700]   then tap water and the
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.220]   if if
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.700]   95 said that they wanted to the the cheaper thing in five, you know
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:46.660]   BMW's market share is about five or six percent
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.700]   You know, I mean they that of the market and that's and they're splitting that with Porsche and Tesla and
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:56.580]   For everyone else there's a market out there of people who want to do that and and apple doesn't have any reason
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.220]   I don't think apple has any reason to to extend itself
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.780]   Um, you know past that market
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:07.860]   Unnaturally I don't can see the point that the car market and the computer market are comparable
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:14.180]   But okay, that's just a point of all I know is that the air canada terminal now has a shake shack and let laguardia
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:17.540]   Oh my gosh. I had I not had a shake shack until like a month ago
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:22.820]   And now it's like once a week the new laguardia terminal is just so gorgeous. It won't stay that way
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.220]   It's just opened because it's a laguardia. I mean it just like there's like a sucking
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:33.780]   That's how you go to New York. You fly to laguardia. No, I do not air Canada. I do air Canada from a trail to laguardia
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:37.620]   They're all bad Alex. So like I'm immune now
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:44.740]   Can I can I ask you a question when are you concerned that like you fly to this airport so much that there's going to be a screenburn

[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:19.060]   Titus Burgess who you probably know as

[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.940]   Invincible
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:40.180]   He is so good. I love tight effect. Uh, good. Titus saw this is a great instagram thing. Anyway, he's doing the wizard of az
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:45.700]   Karen Gillan. I don't know who that is secret garden. She was on dr. Who she was
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.540]   Nice pond and then she was nebula in guardian to the galaxy
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.260]   That's why I don't know who she was. Amy pond
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.660]   Uh the time machine kelsey grammar
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:59.140]   Uh and then uh frankenstein there
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.420]   Huh?
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:05.380]   Frazier. Yeah, Kelsey grammar. Yeah, and then frankenstein narrated by the host of the lore podcast
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:08.500]   Yeah, erin manky men. How do you say his name?
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.140]   Minky don't
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:13.140]   It's your minke
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.420]   Mankey, but disney book group is really my favorite. I'm waiting the poo narrated by disney book group
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.980]   Kind of goes down. I love their work
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:23.380]   Uh, she's fantastic and everything she does. Yeah
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:29.540]   Uh apple hired. I didn't know this former audible senior vice president to run its books division
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:34.180]   I would if i'm audible i'm a little nervous because apple currently doesn't offer her subscription
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:39.620]   Actually don't apple's books come from audible aren't they audible books? I think they are
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:45.860]   Yeah, they had an agreement. Maybe this is I don't know if this is also changing because this is only on uh apple books
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.580]   So maybe apple's getting into the audio books. Oh, yeah recorded by apple
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:55.140]   Yeah, they're public domain works. It would take it would take an enormous amount of
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:59.780]   Work on apple's part. I mean the problem is that that gets that becomes one of those embedded things like I have
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.260]   I don't know how many hundreds of books on audible never leaving
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.420]   I would never like it's audible. Oh number. Do they just license them and other companies could license them too?
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:08.580]   I think that's exactly right
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:14.180]   So that's an interesting point is that most of the publishers record their own and then license them to audible
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:21.140]   But audible has its own originals and notice interest in audible is a sponsor that audible is really beefing up the original section
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:27.300]   That's their defense right every every content company wants to be distinguished like distinct if you can easily just move your catalog around
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.380]   It's not good for them. Yep
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:34.180]   So I suspect a little a little battle on the audiobooks front is coming
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:38.020]   And you know there one one of the things that I've been surprised at is just requests
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:43.940]   From clients is there's a huge uptick on both audiobooks and podcasting because of all these speakers
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:47.940]   You know, so I didn't I didn't realize I was like, why is suddenly everyone asking me about podcasting again?
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.180]   And it's all these people are listening all the
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:55.620]   Echo and everything else. There's been this huge uptick on on companies looking
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:58.900]   I knew it would be good for podcasts because you could say echo play
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.460]   Mac break weekly. Yeah, it will
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:05.460]   Yeah, so that was that was a highlight of one of the updates to my
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:12.500]   My Nvidia shield tv box last a couple days ago, which hey now you can ask now you can ask for podcasts
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:18.100]   And great. That's huge. There's I think there's again. We're about to start seeing a big push in that area
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.140]   I got in a podcast just in the nick of time then
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:27.860]   It was like it was like like Harrison Ford going underneath the wall before it closes down on him
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:30.180]   Just like so close
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.420]   Then you reach everything to keep running
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:38.100]   I'm going back to audio. Oh, man. We I was giving a tour. We had a big group from kizer. They want to do a
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.300]   podcasting internally and
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:48.740]   So they they've come before they want to see our eyesores get them a tour and I said all of this all of this if I weren't doing video and live streaming
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.260]   All of this millions of dollars worth of equipment the elemental
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:57.060]   All right, the the the tricaster I wouldn't know about what I wouldn't have any of that stuff
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.140]   What do you wouldn't be really honestly? I'll just be honest here
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:04.100]   You would be in my bedroom right now lying on my back with a headset with a headset
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:08.100]   But you and you would never know but you do yeah
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:14.900]   Costco now sells max we were talking about Amazon then how maybe you don't want to buy an iPad on
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.900]   You have to buy them in four packs
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:23.220]   If you're a Costco member you can get the macbook macbook air macbook pro and iMac lines on the website
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:26.260]   with kind of significant discounts
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.300]   And in some cases
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:34.020]   Alex they include apple clear plus oh there you go, but it'll take forever to register it
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:37.780]   So that makes the macbook air mere 999
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:42.900]   To per customer. Oh and you block origin is blocked it
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:49.300]   Here we go now apple macbook air intel core i5 8 gigs of memory 128 gig ssd
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:55.060]   Member only item, but I could tell you it's 999. That's a that's a good deal. Yeah, it's great deal
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:59.860]   We'll cover your cost of Costco ownership. Yeah, I've my first my first
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:02.420]   Powerbook was bought at Costco
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:06.180]   I got it was uh, the it's the power book 100
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.220]   It was when they like got just continued or whatever and it was a landmark piece of news
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.940]   Oh, well, you know, you can get them for like half price at Costco
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:18.980]   And I remember because I was like, I don't know like 18 or 19 my summer job
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:24.980]   I had to be at my summer job the next I figured out that if I have to the only Costco
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:29.220]   Any the closest Costco was like a 90-minute drive away
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:36.260]   And the only way that I could get one is if I drove on like if I got up really really early before work
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:40.100]   Drove 90 minutes down to Costco bought one drove back
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:46.020]   Getting to get into work just in time and basically do all this on like four hours of sleep
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:50.260]   Uh, but it was so I still have it. It's so totally worth it. I could beat that
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.220]   I bought my first macintosh at macy's
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:56.340]   I remember very well going into macy's
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:59.060]   And uh, because I had a macy's charge card
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:04.020]   So I could charge it on the card 2500 bucks for that original macotage
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:09.060]   I could I can it's funny. It must have made an impression on me because I could I know exactly what it looked like
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:13.540]   Where they were selling that I can remember that spot. It really makes an impression on you and that was
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:18.500]   84 I remember buying like because I was I was like not not too tired to well
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:26.420]   I was tired too tired to drive by any standard except for like an 18 or 19 year old who thinks that he's in
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:28.660]   I should not have done that. I will say don't
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:33.060]   It was but it was one of those things where it's like, okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna go to this
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:39.380]   Before I drive back. I'm gonna go to the the gas station get like two really big bottles of Hawaiian punch
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:46.820]   Because i'll down both of them in like about five minutes. I will use the sugar rush to like get me safely home
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:52.020]   I shouldn't I know I shouldn't have done that but yes, I remember every single detail of that trip
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.980]   I also remember taking a nap under my desk, but I got to work
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:59.220]   That's how this whole show began
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.900]   34 years ago bad decisions. Yeah
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:08.500]   Sidia speaking of bad decisions that was the app store for jailbroken iPhones is shutting down
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.140]   Yeah
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.140]   Uh, he's not making any money. That's why
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:16.820]   Jay Freeman Sorek
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:21.060]   Says a combination of costs and security issues it loses money
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:27.460]   Um and when and when there were multiple staffers cost him a significant chunk of his sanity
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.500]   Jay, I'm with you on that
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.580]   Ah, I know how it is my sanity is long gone
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:37.860]   Andi and i apologize
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:44.580]   Alex that's that's too bad though, but it shows that a jailbroken there there it's a such a niche
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:47.140]   The need for a jailbroken phone
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:52.660]   Uh, and I really wish that's a lot that more progress had been made to the idea of well
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:55.700]   What if we totally unlock this and put android on an iphone?
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:01.540]   uh, and they made and or put like a basic basically turning into a into a linux phone and
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:07.380]   Early steps got taken early successes were made, but there are so many drivers
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.020]   You need to write that just getting a command prompt
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:17.460]   Or just getting a boot screen is you're like on the first you've completed the eighth step of a thousand step journey
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:20.020]   Uh because it's it's interesting hardware
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:25.460]   It would be interesting to see what people could do with it if they were able to totally unlock it and then just use it as a
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.380]   as an advice platform
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:31.540]   Uh because that's there's a lot of there's a lot of pretty cool hardware that's in in drawers right now
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.940]   That's not doing much, but yes
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.140]   I
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.260]   I enjoyed the idea of what what city was trying to do
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.820]   I'm glad they were there for the first three years when
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:46.500]   They're when I still remember any gathering of more than 12 apple nerds
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.420]   Uh, there would be one person who like oh wait, let me get let me download that email
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:55.380]   Let me just turn my iphone into a hotspot. Wait a minute. How are you turning your iphone into a hotspot?
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:59.940]   Wait a minute. Are you cup cut copying and pasting things and yeah, that's
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.820]   notifications
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:08.820]   The sort of thing that basically teaches people that wow my phone can could and should be much better than what it is right now
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:14.180]   Apple hired a lot of the best jailbreak engineers, so they got a lot of stuff that you really know that's funny
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:20.180]   If they're security experts like you want you want to hire a crook you what you you hire a card sheet for your casino and give them a
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:25.300]   Lot of money to maintain those monitors soric is going to keep the downloads up though
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:29.300]   They just can't purchase stuff. So if you did download something from the cds store
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.820]   You uh you downloaded that demo god thing
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:37.940]   I remember that was a jailbroken thing so you could get the output of the phone onto the screen
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:42.660]   This is going back a long time ago. Yeah, it was like I have a jailbroken a phone in years
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:47.220]   I think it was so painful that I just decided to do it. It's not worth it in the security issues and so forth
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:52.980]   So thank you soric for doing it. Uh and thank you for even though the main expense of this is the downloads
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.340]   He's going to keep those downloads up because he feels like he owes people
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:01.700]   What about this crazy person who's suing apple saying
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.460]   You didn't tell me about the notch
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:13.700]   I love this so much because he's he is so smart that he can do the sub pixel math on a pentile versus an RGB stripe display
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:20.180]   Knowing which pixels overlap and which ones don't but he he can't extrapolate measurements or see a notch
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:26.180]   The iphone 10 product is advertised as having a 24 by 36 by 11 25 pixels, but in fact
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:28.660]   Does not use true pixels
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:32.980]   With red green and blue sub pixels instead it has only false screen pixels
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.020]   so according to my careful myth politics
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.060]   I am not getting the pixels they paid for
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.020]   uh and
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:45.300]   They hided the notch heighted hidden hidden hidden it
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:49.140]   Uh in their advertising apps by only having black
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:53.700]   screens up at the top there. Mm-hmm. So I didn't know
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.660]   How do you use the worst pixels?
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.740]   I was a spruce, you know
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:02.180]   Although I though I will say that it is hysterically funny that of course
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.220]   That is of course why apple chose that is the standards
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:08.500]   True right. They don't want to emphasize it
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.700]   They were I don't think it was like all over the notch. Yeah
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:16.500]   Well, there you go. Those are the two images, right? So uh on the left
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.980]   I don't think I don't think it's deceptive in any way
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.580]   I'm just saying that when they had it when they had a gallery of things to choose from
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:27.380]   I think that they I think they said that we don't want the first impression that people make is what it why is there?
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:32.260]   Why are there dead pixels at the top of the screen like they're not dead pixels. They're giving you cool stuff, please
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.660]   Just click through to the head
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:40.820]   There are notches just someone trying to cash in the 10 was very I think I think one of the reasons was the 10 was blatantly notched
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:46.660]   And they left the 10 blatantly notched. There's another show title. The 10r was uh, it was was also blatantly notched
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:53.140]   But there were so many other notched phones by the time the 10s came out that apple didn't want to look like that. Yeah, we don't really
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.340]   Yeah
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:37:00.420]   Oh, also. I mean how long did it take for people to figure out that the size of the apple watch display was nowhere near as large
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:08.340]   As it looked like because of that black background, which is it's not it's not deception so much as let's make our product look as good as possible
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:15.220]   I think and legitimately looks prettier without like a black band around uh around the live display
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.420]   There is a crazy steve jobs
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:24.900]   Fan club out there that will buy anything steve has ever touched someone just paid $6,000
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.700]   For his business card
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:31.860]   Not signed just his business card. It's not even a ceo card
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:36.340]   Chairman of the board. Oh, yeah, it's not even so this is like after he was uh

[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:37.620]   I've since the time that I actually met uh steve jobs had a personal interaction with them like face-to-face
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:41.780]   Only once uh and I kept the uh damaged self-esteem

[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:54.660]   It's interesting. I maintain that on a daily basis. So it's still as shiny and detailed as it was that day when I have that
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:39:00.020]   We all have all of us that have had personal interactions steve have the
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:05.380]   The notch that was like removed and it's like a you know, it's here at all

[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:34.260]   He looked at me realized I was nowhere near their intellectual capacity
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:37.220]   And went back to his conversation with mrs
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.540]   He allowed me to sit in the room. However, which was nice
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:46.100]   So I too I I will keep that my mind was worse than that worse than that he didn't put me down or anything
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:51.780]   That just ignored me actually he did yell at me. I I for not playing volleyball well enough. Oh, there you go

[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:44.420]   At our so our the twit christmas party was a dinner at a nice little place in the town
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:47.060]   That happens to be right next door to a gym
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.300]   last thursday
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.700]   And lo and behold a cresilia emerges
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:56.020]   The gym lisa and I are looking at it saying we have no chance
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.900]   And then I remembered
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:03.460]   There might be a few people on the staff who still play pokemon go so I shouted above the din
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:09.380]   There's a raid out here and lo and behold how many people do we get karsen you were playing?
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:14.900]   I was playing lisa was playing I think we got seven or eight people in that gym. That's awesome and we took down the cresilia
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:20.340]   That's awesome. How do you get though? I mean if you get this hoho or the lugee or whatever the court
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:24.260]   Is a bunch of people in discord because like with all say oh there's one at this place
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.060]   And then we'll try to get six or seven or something. Oh on the weekend
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:29.540]   We had 30 people showing up for each of them. It was amazing
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:33.060]   See in new york city or san francisco if there's a raid
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:37.140]   You just go in because there's a million because the office buildings are filled with p. Yeah, the whole
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:39.300]   Example is an a million people in the lobby
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:44.820]   Uh, I want to john. I want to what what kind of iphone is this it has this button on it
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:52.660]   Here is here is there's the picture. I love the suit leo. Thank you. Look at here's the video of karsten and his light up bow tie
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:55.860]   Josh windish capture with a suit like that
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:42:01.620]   There's anthony niehlson and his wife tina. They're playing it is a dapper into all that we had a dapper bunch
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:06.180]   We're all tap tap tapping tap tap tapping get the cresilia get the cresilia
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.660]   There's lisa
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:11.620]   That's crazy business. That's amazing. That's crazy
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.180]   But we got them
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.260]   Yep, and then lisa couldn't catch him. So I had an extra cresilia. So I traded with her
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.740]   Oh, that's nice. Yeah
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:25.700]   So is that how I can get people to show up for my new year's eve party by creating like a pokemon like
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:30.100]   Nearby if I could create a gym here. I would do it so fast
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:33.140]   We don't even have a
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:35.540]   Level you just need a level you just need a level 10 ingress player. They can add all those things
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:38.580]   All right. Any level 10 ingress players in the house
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:43.060]   Is that is level 10 the highest at ingress? Yeah, I think so still
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.060]   I
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:48.340]   Played ingress when it first came out. This is from the same company in aiantic
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:53.940]   Uh, but the problem was petaluma had nobody so there was nothing to do you could capture the post office over and over again
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.380]   But now I think it's spread out a little bit. Yeah, they're shipping harry potter next year
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:06.980]   It's going to be even more insane. Yeah, the guys in roanda were playing ingress. You know that yeah, there was it's oh i'm gonna i
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:12.500]   Warning as soon as harry potter comes out. I'm off pokemon go
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.300]   I
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:21.460]   Can't wait play. I'm going to the new golden snitches to catch. I've got snitches to catch everywhere
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:25.780]   Uh, we're gonna take a break come back with your picks gentlemen ready your picks
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:30.820]   And it can't be pokemon go, but I know you want to go to that raid so we're gonna get this done here
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:33.460]   No, it's they're all nightly. Oh, i'm fine. Okay
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:37.140]   They're all night. I thought they stopped at 730
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:40.900]   There's thought it depends in your area. They're stopping an hour later for some people now
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:44.340]   I don't know if that's you can never tell if that's a glitch or a feature with my antique though. I know
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:47.220]   in canada raids go later
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:50.820]   Christmas comes sooner, but the raids go later
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:52.740]   Remember christmas is
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:44:01.700]   Show today brought to you by privacy privacy comms and ex best thing virtual cards from whenever I buy online now and for the last six months
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.700]   I've been using privacy comm
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:09.380]   You don't use the same password everywhere. So why would you use the same credit card number everywhere when you shop online?
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:15.140]   Every time you need a credit card privacy comm generates a brand new virtual visa card
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:17.700]   For every purchase with one click
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:23.780]   I've got the browser extension here on uh on my chrome and you can see how easy it is
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:28.420]   Anyone at the time I want to create a new card and the minute you use the card, which is so cool
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:32.740]   It's locked in so here's the card I use to pay for rise and I could show you that number you couldn't use it
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:37.620]   Because it's locked into verizon. Let's create a new card. You can also set a spending limit
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.180]   per month per year total
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:46.420]   You can say this card is such a burner. It can only be used once for a $300 purchase and never again
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:52.340]   You gotta love that you can name it. You can give it images. Let's say it's your netflix card
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.300]   Save that this is so awesome
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:45:03.700]   Security of your data is the core of what privacy comm does their pcidss compliant held to the same security standards as your bank
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:07.860]   Sensitive information is secured using military grade encryption
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.820]   In fact, even better because they use split key crypto
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:16.180]   So different partial keys are held by separate employees. So no one person can access the data on the server
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:19.700]   It's kind of like the like war games. They have to have to have
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:25.220]   Uh different people to unlock it and and these cards let you use any billing info too by the way
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:29.300]   So you don't have to use your real address or even real zip code. It'll be approved
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:35.940]   So your information remains secure and private. There's a web hook api. They support two factor authentication
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.020]   Look, i'm sorry rene. It's only available in the us
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:45.060]   It is 100 free to use and just like credit cards. They make their money from merchants
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:48.100]   They don't sell your information. There are no hidden fees
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:52.340]   I've been using this and I love it. You should try it just like credit cards
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:58.740]   It's easy. It's fast, but they're oh one difference. They are tied to your debit card or your checking account
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:04.260]   They've saved customers over a hundred million dollars in unwanted and unauthorized charges
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.780]   due to compromised cards hidden fees and
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:12.020]   Forgotten subscriptions. Yes, you can pause a card anytime or freeze it
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:16.820]   And so if there's a subscription and you go, huh? Why am I paying for this every month?
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:18.180]   I wish
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:22.740]   I got to go back now through all the old subscriptions that are tied to my real credit cards and move them over to privacy
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:25.380]   So I can turn them off with a push of a button
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:33.060]   I love privacy.com protect your privacy and your money with virtual cards from privacy.com
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:36.740]   No interest rate because it comes right out of your checking account. You should be aware of that
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:41.380]   I mean, it's like a debit card in that respect, but it is a visa card. So it's protected like a visa card
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:42.420]   I just really think it's awesome

[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:07.780]   because for some reason
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:12.260]   I had signed up and they didn't know anything about it. And I so they were saying you haven't paid your bill
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:16.180]   We're on a disconnect your phone. So I called and I said I couldn't get through they they screwed up my account

[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:29.540]   Where it's like wow, I have never heard of any of these songs
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:34.980]   And they were clearly written hoping to become perennial christmas standards that will basically pay for my third house
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:41.700]   Uh, or they are like hey frang. Let's we we still got like we've still got 38 minutes left
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:48.020]   A booked in this studio. What if we like we're saying all the public domain christmas songs and just like release a christmas album
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:54.820]   This is right there in the middle where a couple of what a few you haven't heard of all the classics and all them sung by
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:01.940]   Ella freaking fits Gerald. I have this. This is the best happy is most nicest and it's on every single service
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:09.060]   So it's on apple music. It's on amazon. It's on everything. The other one is one of my oldest probably my first original christmas tradition
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.900]   Listening to patrick steward's one man performance of a christmas carol
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:16.100]   Uh, it's an hour and 47 minutes you buy it on onable
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.620]   I bought it on cd and ripped it because I don't want any copy protection
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.660]   But you do but do whatever you want it's easiest to get from from audible
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:25.780]   He does it is a it's not a reading
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:32.420]   He's not like reading a christmas carol. He used to do annually a one man show where he's on stage in front of a
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:38.580]   Live theater audience doing all the voices and so yes, he does the tiny. He does the tiny 10 voice
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:47.060]   Yes, he also does, you know, oh, oh, he didn't die of nothing catching did he and you and this is this is where you really hear the
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:49.700]   Sorry, that's not it
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:53.300]   That's not it. I pushed the wrong play button. Here's it here. It is
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:59.220]   Not being a man of strong imagination. He failed. He's so good
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:06.660]   American's my uncle people don't realize that before he was who came upon him so quickly that this happened in the enterprise
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.820]   He had of his approach is a great
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:14.100]   He's so he is or Charles is walking in the fall. He says this is good at christmas care
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.020]   So this is his one man show
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:18.820]   He I think it's a slightly trimmed on version of the show
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:22.340]   But I I have been playing this
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:28.900]   Several times a year during the christmas season since I bought it at building 19 the salad store
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.780]   That is now defunct on two cassettes
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:39.300]   And I have bought new versions of it every time that they've become available. It really is just a beautiful
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:42.180]   Beautiful performance from start to finish nice
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:48.660]   Very nice. I love that L.A. album too. I listen that every yeah, that's like hall
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:51.140]   Whatever mood you're in this will fix it
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:55.620]   Not like a ten tations a ghetto christmas carol. I
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:51:04.500]   This is my pick and I don't know where this came from karsen. Did you find this?
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.700]   Play apple music.com
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.300]   It's a web interface to your apple music
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:14.340]   Yeah, and it's not apple right
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:19.620]   It's music kit isn't it music it based I guess so but it's great
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:23.860]   So you want some essential christmas music just play it on your web
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:26.420]   in your web browser
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:31.380]   Every other music solution spotify google music has a web interface. I don't know
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:34.500]   Why I should have to download
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.180]   iTunes
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:38.180]   Yeah, just to listen to moriah carry
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:46.500]   So uh, this is play apple music.com it goes through an oauth process logging into apple
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:52.500]   There's a there's a way to do that so you don't you're not giving them your password apples doing all the authentication
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:55.460]   I think this is fantastic
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:52:01.220]   Really really nice job. I don't know so we don't know who did it just somebody
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:09.620]   Yeah, it's it's such an important thing too because you don't necessarily know where you're good
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:14.980]   You don't you're not necessarily in front of a computer where you thought to install the software that you need and to open up
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:20.340]   Open up a browser. That's one of the reasons why I use google play and it's one of the reasons why I still have
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:26.580]   Amazon music just the ability to open a browser and listen to access a playlist not just an album but a playlist that
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:33.700]   It it really does hit all of your syncing problems with a big hammer when all you need to do is open a web browser on advice
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:38.980]   This is what i've been listening to non-stop springsteen on broadway the soundtrack
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:44.820]   That was so good. Oh so good. This is on my apple music and yes, you have a chrome book
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:48.420]   You can listen to your apple music now. I mean there's a lot of reasons to do this is a good idea
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:52.740]   I saw the video of when he brought that little kid up to say
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:53:00.580]   To play with him. He didn't do that at the the show. I was at yeah. Yeah, I tried I waved my hand
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:03.940]   I think it helps if you're 13 years old
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.500]   You boo
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.900]   Didn't work
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.180]   Uh, your pick of the week mr. Alex lindsay my christmas pick
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:17.140]   Okay, cool. Oh, yeah, I my my my wife's
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:22.660]   Family has listened to that. I mean her whole life and so I just kind of you know 18 years ago. I ever
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:25.060]   Uh fell into it
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:30.900]   And uh now I just connect it to christmas like if if it's christmas day and you're not listening to neck and coals christmas
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:36.340]   Is something wrong, you know, and so anyway, so you're christmasing wrong whole albums really good your christmas sing
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:40.420]   But my my my pick is is called remove dot bg
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:42.820]   Um, and it's just a really flat
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:43.860]   It's
[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:48.980]   Remove dot gg. What? Um, it's a cool. A cool web page. You literally can upload just take a picture
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:52.820]   Yeah, um, they have some security. They talk about it on the on they talk about it on the page
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:58.740]   This can't possibly work. It does work really well. It removes the background from a photo. Yeah, you just throw some
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:01.140]   Only work with a photo. It's
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.860]   On your hard drive, right? Yeah, uh, yeah, I might know you can or you can give it a URL
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.260]   I have some pictures on my hard drive. Let's see. Uh,
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:12.260]   So my first pixel cord tutorial. I don't know what i'm gonna get here. So
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:14.260]   Uh
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:16.260]   Hold hold your breath
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.940]   Um, there's no items. These are just a bunch empty folders. Oh man
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:23.540]   Oh man
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:28.740]   That's pretty amazing, but see I don't trust it actually works the websites. I threw a bunch of stuff up there
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.380]   It's not perfect, but it is something that does
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:36.900]   A really good job if you're looking a lot of times you're you're trying to grab something especially if you're doing a presentation
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:44.100]   You're trying to throw something into your keynote doc or whatever and you see the remove that background and it's a little too complicated to use the instant alpha that apple
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:48.100]   Uh uses, um, I think that uh, you know this one
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:53.860]   Uh, you know works pretty well at pulling, you know, if you again if you have uh some people that you want to throw in there
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:58.420]   What kinds of images though? It's not liking the images. I'm throwing at it. I've I've only thrown jpegs at it
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.220]   Okay, and what it'll do is it'll let you download a
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.620]   Once you've given it a jpeg, it'll give you back a ping with an alpha
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:12.020]   Um, and so you can you know throw something up there. I don't know. I don't know how it'll yeah my uploads keep failing
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:15.940]   I don't know why I don't know if it doesn't like me. Yeah, so I've I've uh
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:21.220]   You know I threw a couple images in there and it actually uh worked pretty well. I was kind of um
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:24.260]   I wasn't sure you need to have what kind of
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:27.220]   Wow there you go
[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:29.060]   Was that on their website
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:33.380]   Oh great now. Jeff's gonna be targeted by a drone. Well, is there a picture on their website?
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:41.300]   Uh, I put the I just did that. Oh you just oh good. Thank god. Well, this will be useful for us. Yeah, that's pretty cool
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:46.660]   All right, I'm gonna try one more time. I'm gonna miss the ear selected photo for my uh
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.500]   Download
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:52.740]   Oh, yeah, it did pretty good. I mean that's hard to do all right. Let's see if we can do this one
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:57.380]   Here's the original image. Oh my goodness. That's pretty good
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:02.100]   That's a tough background tough there's a lot of tough things going on there
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:05.140]   But it's still you know kind of grabs onto those things and so it's better than I would do
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:08.500]   It's just like you know if you're trying to throw something together and and again
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:12.020]   There's certain things that I found as I started to experiment with it things that are out of focus
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:15.780]   It's using you know AI of course so things that are out of focus in the background. It's gonna
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:20.180]   pull better than then um, you know other uh other
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:25.140]   It's funny. It decided that the christmas lights. I was wearing as a hat was a background was a background
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.380]   That was right out
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:31.060]   So embedded ones that kept though and it's free. It doesn't cost you anything to do it
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:35.940]   Um, they I think they say on the website that they hold onto the photo for about an hour as they process it and then get rid of it
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:38.980]   They're not going to share it with anyone. That's not the the goal is to show off the technology
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:41.620]   Um, oh, that's pretty good
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:43.060]   That's pretty yeah
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:46.020]   And I think this is this is actually the direction that AI is heading
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:48.980]   It doesn't have to be it's hard to make something AI or
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:51.540]   An app do something that's perfect
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:57.780]   But if it can do it close enough that it turns an hour long job from an expert into
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:04.340]   Six minutes of fine tuning by anybody. That's a huge win. Well, can you fine tune it? I mean, does it you can't fine tune it right now
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:08.660]   I mean, this is a show of technology. So it's not really you know, so they're there if you look up at the top
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:13.220]   They're making they're looking at making the api available. Oh, that would be interesting
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:20.420]   That would be really interesting if the api were yeah, you could then call it from a shortcut for instance. You know
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:23.220]   That'd be really cool
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:28.260]   Well, if there's a nice picket it's a r emov e dot bg
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:33.940]   Now actually did that one really well. Look at that. That's Jason snell on the set
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:37.780]   And uh, Jason snell in space
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:45.220]   Perfect let's unbrand for him too. That's a good one too. Wait, if it saves that one, I need that
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:52.660]   Yo, what do you do? Remember that's that's instant. Yeah, you know, it's not that's remarkable
[01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:58.180]   Yeah, is it from i think i think that's a twits first enamel pin. I think yeah, should I make a pin
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.580]   It doesn't talk about who color lip
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:03.460]   That's just a template for the page. Oh
[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:10.420]   This is training the drones this is directly drones karsten. Who is this training? This is made by colido
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:13.220]   Klei d i d o dot ai
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:16.100]   A division of dark in it
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:18.100]   You know division of your brand marketing
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.300]   They're selling these filters. It's interesting
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:28.500]   Huh, that's good pr. Yep, and you know, it's nice. They didn't really brand it like crazy. They just made it available
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:34.180]   Uh, I think all that leaves left is uh, rene richy your pick of the week
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:38.180]   So I I have two picks one is and I left it in the car
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:44.180]   So I am incredibly stupid, but apple has finally and i'll pause so everyone in the audience can give a finally ship the clear case
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:48.180]   For the iphone tenr which was not available at launch but is available now
[01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:52.980]   Some people have complained about the price, but i've i've bought all the clear cases that they've had out since
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:55.700]   The iphone tenr launch desperate to have something to
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:59:02.740]   Keep the phone and i have spigons and uh ring cheese and all of them as they have been yellower and smelier
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:08.740]   And this thing is amazing. It is clear. It is hard. It is completely transparent
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:13.140]   It looks amazing. I put some photos up on my instagram because people kept asking about it
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.140]   It's got a lip over the top so it doesn't put the screen flat down when you put it on the ground
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:21.460]   It's around the camera sensor and the light properly so it doesn't diffuse any imaging
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:25.860]   The buttons are a little bit tough and some people have complained that they're a little bit hard to push
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:29.220]   I don't find them hard to push, but I do find them a little bit overly stiff
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:31.540]   So I would prefer if they were a little bit looser
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:36.100]   But overall if you bought your iphone tenr because you love the color and you want to show off the color
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:40.660]   And you don't want to just put it in any old stink in case this is a super high quality
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:45.780]   I don't know there's probably some fancy chemical name for the kind of clearness that they're using on the clear stuff here
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:48.420]   But it just looks really really good
[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:54.180]   So if you have the colored one, I recommend that I also have a cheap and shameless plug every year
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:57.620]   I do a list of what I think apple got wrong during the year
[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:02.660]   Apple's biggest misses and I just put up the list for this year earlier today so
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:06.900]   And it's funny to me because every time I do this I get called an apple hater in a jerk
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:11.540]   Regardless of how much apple fanboyism or apologism might do during the rest of the year
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.860]   So what have you know, that's just the internet
