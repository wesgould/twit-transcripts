[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.680]   Here he is, a man of infinite brains.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.240]   and Pixelcorpixacore.tv for the podcast.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.040]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.440]   Hello.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.840]   Good to be here.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.520]   It's not on the road as he usually is.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.080]   For the moment, I'm going to--
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.440]   next week, I'm going to Tokyo.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.000]   But I'll be here.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.800]   I'll be here on Tuesday.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.520]   But on Wednesday, then I'm going to Tokyo.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.080]   Chimney Christmas.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.760]   That turtle could be not other than the lovely Andy
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.000]   Naco.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.640]   The Chicago sometimes.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.320]   I'm just imagining the 10 megabits internet connection
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.720]   you're going to be getting from your phone in Tokyo.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   It's not 10 megabits.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.760]   It's 10 megabytes.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   Sorry.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   Sorry.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.720]   I'm a hotel.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.920]   From the hotel over the Wi-Fi.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360]   First second, really.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yeah, the hotel I stayed in for six weeks
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.320]   had 10 megabyte connection in Tokyo.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.240]   And I backed up the internet.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720]   Do I still get it while you keep it?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.400]   I was like, now it's all local.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.760]   I don't have to be searching online.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   I don't have to worry about being connected.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.880]   I just backed it up.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.840]   Our big story this week-- actually, there's a lot of big stories.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360]   But one of the big stories this week
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   was the surprise turnaround on Apple's part last week,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   allowing Google voice applications into the app store,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.240]   including GV Mobile, which was the application by Sean
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.520]   Kovacs that had been pulled.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.200]   I didn't walk.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.920]   I ran.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.400]   I ran to my computer down road.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.040]   I was like, I don't know if they're going to leave it up.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.120]   I'm just going to download it right now.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   We have on the Skype with us right now, Sean Kovacs.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.480]   He's the developer of GV Mobile Plus.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.600]   Hey, Sean, it's great to see you.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.160]   Great to see you too, thanks.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.000]   You must be happy to be back on the Apple store.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.120]   It's a surprise, yeah.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.040]   It's definitely a good thing.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.280]   So you've been blogging all along.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.760]   It's actually because of you that we've kind of known all
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.480]   along what's been going on with this Google--
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.400]   GV Mobile was in the app store when Google applied to get
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.880]   its Google voice application in the app store.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.280]   Apple turned down Google and yanked you.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yeah, it seems to work that way.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   Apple's official reason for removing my app and some other
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.320]   ones is a duplicated functionality.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440]   So that just happened to happen around the same time Google
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.400]   wanted to get their app in there.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.320]   This was what, around about June of this year?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   July of '09.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.400]   '09, I should say, yeah.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.000]   So did you open source GV Mobile?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.440]   Did you make it possible for people to put it on their
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.400]   jailbroken phones?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.120]   I did, yeah.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.720]   So immediately following the removal, I set that version
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.920]   free on citya for people that wanted to get it.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.760]   And a couple months later, I released a paid version, which
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.400]   is, I guess, an enhancement to what was on the app store before.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.080]   Right.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.440]   How did you find out that you were going to get back in a
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.760]   year later?
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.240]   I'm actually surprised that once you allowed it on
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.320]   citya, that Apple would even consider it.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.200]   I mean, I would think that would be the mark of--
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.440]   mark of cane.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.360]   Yeah, so there's some risk in doing that.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.400]   But nonetheless, people still wanted the app, and there
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.240]   was nothing out there.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.600]   So somebody had to do it, and I figured that might be
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.680]   me.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.320]   So how I figured out is on the ninth, which was my birthday,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.400]   they released new guidelines for the app store.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.160]   And by new, I mean more specific guidelines that the
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   review team follows.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   And from there, I reviewed it, and noticed naturally that
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.240]   the app didn't break any of those.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.640]   So I sent an email to the appeals team, and I got an
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.760]   email back, surprisingly.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.400]   Now, you talk about this on your blog.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.080]   In fact, going back to July 29, 2009, you say that Apple
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.800]   admits that it was AT&T that pulled GV+.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.880]   Plus.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.720]   Yeah, so I've had a lot of conversation with a number
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.320]   of people who are close to both parties.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.200]   And of course, somebody on one side of the fence will say
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.680]   one thing.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.360]   And it's back and forth.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.640]   So it's pure speculation.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.400]   So I don't know if we ever know why.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.440]   We may never know.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.360]   So the appeal went well, and GV Mobile Plus is now in the
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.560]   store for-- what is it?
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.480]   $2.99?
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.560]   $2.99, correct.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.640]   Any credit for those who bought it the first time around?
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.560]   Yeah, so if I would have been able to keep the GV Mobile
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.840]   name, people would have been able to upgrade it.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   But then I still have the city of folks that paid for it as
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.200]   well.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.440]   So what I'm doing for those guys, and reality, anybody can
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   get on the offer this Saturday night.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.360]   I'm going to set it to free.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.880]   So anybody that purchased it before, either on
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.360]   Cityo or the App Store can get that bad boy for free.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.920]   But we would ask-- be the honor system, right?
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.000]   If you haven't bought it, buy it.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.960]   Listen, if you like it, buy it.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.160]   But certainly people can get on and try it, I guess.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.400]   So I'm using my producer, Eileen's iPhone, because she's
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.960]   already got it.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.160]   I'm still downloading on mine.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.360]   So you log into your Google voice account.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.920]   Does it immediately populate it?
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.160]   Yeah, that phone number is OK to give that out.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.400]   John's in the other room saying, phone number.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.840]   That's Twitch's phone number, 800-605-twit.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.960]   You can call that, but no human will answer.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.880]   Entering your Google voice credentials, and then it
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.320]   populates it with, I could see, your contacts.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.960]   Do all your previous history get populated in there, or do
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   you have to start from scratch?
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.960]   So the mystery behind the app, essentially it's a front end
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.480]   to the Google Voice website.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.480]   So that allows the app to tie into the iPhone contacts, and do
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.240]   a lot of the features that the website--
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.320]   Or that's me.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.520]   The web app doesn't allow.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.800]   So these are the iPhone contacts.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.480]   So I'm looking at the iPhone contacts,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.360]   what I look at contacts in here.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.920]   Yep, so there's an iPhone.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.680]   There are plans to bring in Google contacts as well.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.800]   So that's going to be-- there's a number of updates.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.400]   And when I make a call here, am I making a call on Google
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.880]   Voice?
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.960]   Does it work on 3G as well as Wi-Fi?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.800]   So it uses your cell minutes.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.920]   It doesn't do VoIP calling yet.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.480]   I know Gmail recently started allowing that to use internet
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.200]   based calling.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.680]   But currently right now, Google Voice only allows
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.040]   real phones to make calls.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.280]   So either they call you back on your iPhone
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.840]   before making the call, or there's
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.920]   a new direct dial feature where they give you a number to
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.440]   call and it'll connect you through.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.880]   But either way, it's going to use AT&T minutes.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.840]   Unless-- I mean, you can point it to, say, call your
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   home phone and you can initiate that through the phone, but
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.520]   have a call your home phone, your work phone, whatever phone.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.000]   So I'm using Google Voice on my computer and Gmail so I
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.440]   could actually have it--
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.560]   I could call through my iPhone and then have it call my
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   computer.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   And I'd have to pay for minutes.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   There's a lot of tricks.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.360]   I mean, people have worked out ways where they can use Gizmo
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.440]   and other VoIP services in conjunction with it to make
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.880]   totally free calls.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.720]   Is it running in the background?
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.000]   So it's going to run completely.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.120]   It's not going to--
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.680]   Well, the background, Apple doesn't allow programs to
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.480]   pull data in the background, refresh.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.600]   Now there is push coming for SMS and voicemail.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.160]   And it's a couple months out.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.600]   And that'll allow you to see when you get a new message or
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.040]   whatnot.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.600]   But it's kind of limited in what you can do in the
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.040]   background.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.960]   OK.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.480]   So--
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.160]   It's good to know.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.400]   Andy, don't let me monopolize if you have a
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.880]   question too.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.680]   I want to give you that.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.520]   No, no, I know it gets time to short.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   I guess what people are mostly asking about is that on
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.040]   Android, you can essentially use Google Voice as just a
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.800]   drop-in replacement for your current phone service.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.320]   Can you really do that on the iPhone or is Apple kind of
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.720]   blocking that kind of feature?
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.360]   Yeah, that brings up the whole wall of garden experience on
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.760]   the iPhone.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.440]   Now, on gel-burkin phones, it's possible, but on the
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.320]   app store versions, it's just not possible yet.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.920]   Sean, are you a professional developer?
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.680]   Are you a student?
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.200]   What is your background?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.240]   A student?
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   Do I look that young?
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   Yeah, you could be a student.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.520]   It's mostly the Miller Lite posters of the ladies in the
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.680]   background that were on.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.400]   I'm actually trying to decipher your shirt.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.800]   There's a big M on it and it looks like a pair of scissors,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.920]   but that can't be.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   No, that's just Mark Echo.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.800]   Oh, it's Echo, OK.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.600]   It's not Michigan or something like that.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.800]   It's not the right blue anyway.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.960]   All right.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.240]   No, this is a hobby.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.480]   So a lot of people think I'm a pro or whatever, but it's just
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.880]   my nighttime gig, I guess.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.480]   Are you, at this point, satisfied with your experience
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.720]   developing for the iPhone?
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.280]   Yeah, you know, it's--
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.400]   and what I can get done, yeah, I'm satisfied, you know,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.440]   especially after getting back on the store, of course.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.040]   And have you made some money on this thing?
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.400]   I mean, is it paying off?
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.840]   I guess it's a little early to tell right now, but--
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   It's not Angry Birds money, but you know.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.040]   Hey, dude, nothing's Angry Birds money.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.200]   They're not as angry as they seem.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.000]   They're quite happy.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Happy Birds.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.200]   Good.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.280]   So this is something that you would--
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.080]   despite what must have been a pretty negative feeling
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.440]   in July of '09, it sounds like this might be something
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   that you would do again.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.520]   Yeah, you know, I'm always looking for new ideas, of course.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.600]   So whatever presents me, I'll go for it,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.440]   whether it's continuing on the GV mobile route
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.240]   or doing something entirely different, you know?
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.840]   Now, presumably, since you're able to get back in UN
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.880]   and there's another application also that uses--
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.680]   that's a Google Voice to a Fronten--
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.160]   back on the store, I presume that Google, although Google hasn't
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.200]   said, might reapply as well.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.960]   Yeah, I expect that.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.760]   So you have kind of a limited window to get the word out.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.080]   Yeah, but you know, with the Google app, you know,
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.520]   looking at their Android version,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.720]   it's kind of limited in what it can do.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.360]   I mean, what it does, it does great,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.680]   but it doesn't have all the features in the world
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.480]   that people really want, so--
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.360]   Oh, really?
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.080]   So I'm using it on Android right now.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.600]   What am I missing?
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.200]   Why should I use a GV mobile plus on my iPhone?
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.720]   From my limited experience, stuff like managing
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.520]   your call forwarding numbers.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.840]   Well, you could do that within the app.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   That's cool.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.440]   So I offer some of that and more.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.680]   And Google's approach is just more streamlined
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.160]   and to the content people most want.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.560]   But there's a large user base that wants more, so--
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.920]   Right, right.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.440]   Well, Sean, Sean, go ahead.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.120]   Where's this experience leave you just
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.080]   feeling about your relationship with Apple?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.360]   Because you made an app that people liked.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   It disappeared.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.600]   It went to the land of ghosts and winds.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.000]   And then it came back, does this make you feel--
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   does that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.880]   about developing for iPhone in the future?
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.320]   Or does this just part of the full course?
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   You know, yeah, I did have a bad taste in my mouth.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.880]   And that's slowly starting to go away.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.200]   In time, I'm sure we'll mend our bridges.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   But that's not to say I'm not looking at other platforms
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.320]   as well.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.840]   Interesting.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.240]   Sean, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   We appreciate it.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.920]   Sean Kovex is at SeanKovex.com.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.680]   And GV Mobile Plus is on the store.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.840]   Get it while you can.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.520]   I mean, it was interesting.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.840]   When this went out-- what was it?
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.240]   Thursday or Friday?
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.160]   It went out fast on Twitter.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.080]   And everybody-- you could tell.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.280]   I guess you see numbers at that granularly, probably not, Sean.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.600]   But it must have been like 1,000 downloads
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.440]   in the first two minutes.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.720]   Because everybody wanted to get it.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.640]   Because nobody had any confidence like you out.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640]   It's-- that it would stay there.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.960]   I was like, I don't know if it's going to stay here.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.320]   I don't know if someone just made a mistake.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.000]   And I'm just going to get it on my computer.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.400]   Get it while you can.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.760]   Get it while you can.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.560]   There was a large spike, yes.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.760]   Oh, so you do see some of that?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.120]   I do.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.240]   Yeah, I have some tracking.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.120]   Awesome.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.200]   Sean, thank you so much for joining us on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.440]   Thank you for having me.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.680]   And thank you for a great application.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.960]   We're glad that it's back on the store.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.720]   GV Mobile Plus.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.640]   What's the name of the other one, Alex?
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.160]   I don't--
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.840]   It's a GV Connect.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   GV Connect.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:37.960]   All right.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.680]   So I'm not going to spread any fun about how bad GV Connect is.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.040]   I'm just saying buy them both.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.760]   I bought them both.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.360]   It was the cost of a really nice latte.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.800]   In France.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.000]   We'll make you coffee here so you're set.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.360]   I had some.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.760]   I had some fine stuff.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.640]   Have the John Jammerby coffee?
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.080]   Yes.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.520]   The Jammerby coffee was very good.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   And I saved--
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.240]   I took that money that I saved, and I bought two applications.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.160]   Drinking coffee and taking phone calls.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.760]   There's are two activities that many people do that I do not.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.600]   So you can't justify the cost of $2.99 for this thing.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.040]   I think $2.99 is exactly the right price for a service like that.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.680]   I do have friends who use Google Voice that--
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.200]   that Google Voice sort of pulled them away from the,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.720]   I really don't want people to call me because I have such little control
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.160]   over how people get through to me.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.320]   And Google Voice packaged that, you know what?
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.600]   If this were available 10 years ago,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.280]   I would never become a phone hermit.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.240]   But I'm just--
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   Too late.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.160]   You're setting your ways now, huh?
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   Well, I just-- well, I actually got
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.160]   into a discussion with somebody a little while ago about,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.560]   would you rather get-- would you rather have a conversation
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.760]   in the form of 20 emails or three-minute phone conversation?
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.000]   And I said, 20 emails in which I can just sort of sit down and choose
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   when I get them.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.720]   Think about how I respond to them and respond to them on my own good time.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.800]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.240]   I'll take labor over social awkwardness in the entire--
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.480]   And now everybody wants 140 character messages.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.320]   Well, it's funny.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   I was talking to someone, and I realized how geeky I was getting,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.600]   because I was sitting and talking to go, you know, I'm much better at asynchronous.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.680]   Asynchronous communication.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.560]   I know that this is a conversation.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.720]   Well, I was like, I'm in many different time zones, you know, a lot of the time.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.240]   And when I'm there, I'm doing a lot of things.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.560]   And I really prefer to just fit this in where I can.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.240]   But you know, I think that's--
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.040]   Go ahead.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.160]   I was having a business conversation, like a business meeting
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   that over the phone that had to go for like 45 to like,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.120]   45 minutes and nearly an hour.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.280]   And I'm on the sofa because I just got caught on a really massive cold
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.840]   yesterday.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.800]   And today was really scheduled out for Mac break and sleep.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.200]   And as I'm on the sofa, I have this conversation trying to track
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.920]   every single bit of this news and business that has to be like tracked and followed up on.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.120]   I'm like, how much of this in three weeks time am I going to get OK?
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.680]   And we agreed that you will be paid in used circus elephants.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.840]   They will be delivered in the form of dead corpses to your front lawn.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.720]   I didn't agree to that.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.880]   Yeah, you did.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.400]   OK.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.560]   But it was the night quill talking.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.640]   We're asking for an email.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.600]   I'd be reading and saying, wait a minute.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.760]   I'm being hoodwinked in Bellyhoo.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.080]   It's very interesting.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.360]   First of all, we should say that I think it's safe to say, Andy, that you do have
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.040]   conversations with people who are your friends in real life.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   Yes.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.400]   But we're talking about business conversations.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.800]   But then you have the advantage of there's a good chance that maybe they
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.960]   will pick up for lunch.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.000]   There's some value to the conversation.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.600]   So when we're talking about asynchronous and all of that,
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   this is not--
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.480]   No, I don't really talk to anyone.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.800]   You are actually saying, I want everything.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.320]   Well, the only time I--
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.280]   How does your wife feel about that?
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.440]   She sends me text messages.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.240]   You know, I feel terrible over to the house.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.560]   Until about two years ago, Jennifer did not know how to turn on a computer.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.480]   I had no interest in that.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.360]   And I got her a laptop about two years ago because she kind of had to because of school.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.720]   And she was on the PTA and stuff.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.960]   And the only way they communicate is email.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   Now, I'm kind of sad about it.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.160]   Every evening, she sits in her in the living room with her laptop on her laptop.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.280]   She doesn't talk to me.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   She answers email.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.640]   I think it's punishment for years of neglect.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.800]   My son, I decided he was getting too much iPad time because he was sitting there playing
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   with the iPad.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.280]   And I came over to wrestle with him.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.760]   And he said, go back to work.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   Oh!
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   You see?
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.760]   I was like--
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   I was like--
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   I was like--
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   Okay, you're the spoon.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.760]   Yes, exactly.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   You little boy, blue, and--
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.760]   I'm taking your iPad away.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   I can't find a context for wrestling with my dad right now.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   Exactly.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   I'm sorry, Dad.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.760]   But you're not on my to do this till tomorrow--
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.760]   Yeah, that was a serious catch in the great old--
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   Oh, God.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   --conversation.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   I was like, okay, so we're going to start off.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   My son's a lot like me, boy.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   Exactly.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.960]   So to summarize, you now have a four-year window to know your loved ones before they
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.760]   walk away from you and them from back.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   Please.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   Please.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.960]   Another welcoming message from your friends at Macbreak.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   Well, hey.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   I'm going to know there's a consequence.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   Too much?
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   Too much.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.080]   Actually, I have to say I had one-- my abby called from college this morning on Skype
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.360]   6.30 in the morning.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   Right.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   Because she's East Coast time.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.000]   And despite the fact that this is a straight-A student who's managed to get in one of the
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.680]   most selective colleges in the United States, she still hasn't figured out there's a thing
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   called time zones.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   It's crazy.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   They should get rid of those.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.800]   I mean, when she was in France, it was a lot worse.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.280]   She called it three in the morning.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.760]   So she calls it 6.30 a.m. and I talked to her for an hour via Skype.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   I saw her.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.760]   I could see her.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.960]   But there is a certain-- that was kind of nice.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.480]   And I think that when we start seeing that really integrated fully with our phones, you
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   know, so when we're going to be--
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   I don't think she should do FaceTime.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   I asked her.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   I said, you want to not-- because she has an iPhone 3GS.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   So maybe we could upgrade to the iPhone 4.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.040]   We could FaceTime each other.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   So what's wrong with this?
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.440]   I think-- I'm still-- I'm-- I am not feeling the love for FaceTime.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.720]   I think that if you want to do Skype sitting down in front of a computer or a laptop makes
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.960]   sense, not on the phone.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   Because you have to hold it like this.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.440]   That's a good point.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.120]   But remember that FaceTime is a free feature.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.040]   It's not like-- it's not like they changed the price of the iPhone 4.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.360]   The iPod touch put it in.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   No, no.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   It's a nice feature.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   It's a checkbox.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   But I think that in the long run, it's a selling feature.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.120]   I think as a phone to phone communication, I don't think it's successful.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   I think as a phone to many different things communication, it could be really successful.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   So--
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   I mean by that.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.960]   Well, I still think that FaceTime, the thing that is much more interesting to me is--
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   You know what?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   Hold on.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   Hold on.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   Hold on.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   Let's get to this.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.160]   Take a break when we finished up the GV discussion.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.600]   So let's do that now.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.280]   And be back with more in just a bit.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.320]   Andy Inacco is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.000]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.640]   I am Leo LaPorte, your GDL host.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.520]   You're listening to Backbreak Weekly brought to you by our friends at Citrix, the folks
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.560]   who do that fabulous program, canone as go to meeting.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.040]   They got out-- Citrix is famous for their back end.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   Enterprise grade, remote access.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.920]   Citrix, if you work in business, I'm sure you use Citrix.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Servers, Microsoft licensed the back end for their remote desktop.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.280]   I mean Citrix really is remote access.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.880]   And they built some great consumer products around this, including Go to Meeting.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.360]   We're replacing so many flights.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   It's so great.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   No more travel.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.440]   You know, Citrix should get some kind of like back end on saved carbon credits.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.080]   They should do a carbon credit.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.800]   Yeah, they should be getting-- they should be getting-- you know what?
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.160]   When they talk about people paying carbon credits in, Citrix should be getting any
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   money back out.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   I think a lot of people say, oh, no, no.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   I don't travel.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   I do conference calls.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.360]   But those are deadly too.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.440]   Anybody who spent time on-- well, look at Andy on his sofa.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.640]   I mean, it's the worst.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.440]   It's the last thing you want to do is spend time on a conference call unless it's visual.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   You're seeing things.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.600]   You can work together on documents.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   You can do training.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.560]   If you're in sales, there's nothing.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.280]   You just have to have Go to Meeting on your system.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.160]   And trust me, clients do not-- sometimes when you do it when you say, oh, I want to
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.000]   start an online meeting with you.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.680]   If it's one of those other technologies and the client says, well, I don't have it.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.160]   It's a pain in the butt.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.440]   Go to meetings not like that.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.040]   You could send them an invitation via email.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.880]   But you can even do it on your phone.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   You say, look, just go to go to meeting.com.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.880]   They say, OK, press the button that says, join a meeting.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   I should show you.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   It's so easy.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   And now here's a meeting ID.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.440]   You enter it in and you're done.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.080]   It takes some 30 seconds to get that software on there.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.080]   You know, next show, I'm going to have a Go to Meeting running.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.320]   I'm going to get Eileen in the other room to have a Go to Meeting running.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   And we'll show you this.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.920]   It could not be easier.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.640]   You could try it free for 30 days right now.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.840]   You don't have to take my word for it.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.240]   All they want here, your first name, last name, email address.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.400]   You don't have to be on their newsletter.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.080]   You sign up.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.040]   $49 a month, the first month is free.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.760]   And you get $10 off.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.360]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.840]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.400]   Please give it a try today.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   Just take my word for it.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   It's really awesome.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   It's a transformational technology.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.120]   It's been spreading like wildfires.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   So we have our mentors.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.760]   Have you ever used anything else like the Microsoft solution?
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   Yes, we have used most of the other solutions.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.040]   See, I think about this first of all, it works Mac and PC.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.400]   So you don't-- you know, Microsoft, you've got to tell somebody, well, tell me what you're
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   using.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   Well, there's a lot of different versions.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   There's Adobe Connect.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   There's the Microsoft solution.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   There's a bunch of other ones.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:22.640]   And I have been the-- we're both a recipient and start-- you know, and whatever, starting
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.200]   a person on many of these different things.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.240]   And this one is, in my opinion, the best one.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   Could not agree more.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.440]   We thank Citrix so much for supporting.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   Macbreak Weekly.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   So you-- I'm sorry.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.680]   I didn't mean to interrupt, but we started a conversation.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.920]   I think it's a good one.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.920]   So let's--
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   So FaceTime for it.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.600]   I think the problem with FaceTime right now is that I do think that phone to phone is
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.960]   not as interesting.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960]   I think that--
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.960]   Do you do-- I mean, Andy--
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   I do.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.120]   Well, you don't even use a phone, so you're a bad example.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.600]   Well, but still, there-- it sometimes is like a pocket version to go to meeting.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.080]   Yeah, it's a pocket version.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   My Skype or something.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.320]   My use for it is when-- there are times when an email comes into, well, actually, why don't
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   I show it to you?
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   You have an iPhone, don't you?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   And then we'll work with you.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.600]   So yeah, then you hold the iPhone up to the screen or something?
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   Right.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.680]   Well, actually, it was just-- matter of fact, just a few weeks ago, someone else who's a
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.040]   podcaster wanted to see what my studio-- what my studio setup was here.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   And it was easier to simply.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.680]   I was about to break out the little-- the Photoshop elements and just sort of--
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   Right.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.240]   OK, each square is a light, each circle is a microphone.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.040]   Oh, or I could just simply hold up a camera.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.480]   And see, this is intriguing to me.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.360]   So for special occasions, I can see that the value of that, actually.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   Well, yeah.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.520]   And I think that being able to stream it-- I think that there's a market that's coming
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.320]   somewhere down the path of integrating the FaceTime stuff to like 911 type things where
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.480]   you could call and say, this is what I'm looking at right now.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.200]   You know, like this is-- you know, but you can imagine wanting to call and being able
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.080]   to post video and have that kind of built into the integration.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   But more importantly, I think that what I was hoping to see when we saw the new Apple
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:06.480]   TV was if you had FaceTime on an Apple TV, for instance, or FaceTime on people's computers,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.360]   now you're really talking about a Jetson kind of thing.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:16.600]   And I could totally imagine my wife shooting video of our kids and projecting it to my
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.960]   her parents' TV.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.040]   That would be something that they'd be pretty darn excited about.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.240]   Because they would have to do any technology.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   They just watch it.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   They just watch it.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.120]   But they could also talk back and see that stuff.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   But the point is, is I think that the problem right now is that even though a lot of people
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.360]   have iPhone 4s, it's not ubiquitous enough.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.800]   And I think that-- I do think Apple is starting to fall a little behind on the making this--
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.200]   what they promised, which was making this an open resource that other people could write
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   to.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   We haven't seen that yet.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:54.120]   You know, if we were able to integrate FaceTime with Skype, with Google, with other-- just
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.480]   be able to have a desktop one.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.760]   I mean, we could be running using FaceTime for remotes, for people who are doing-- what
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.080]   Andy's doing right now.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   Right.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.920]   Also, I tend to-- I have to wonder if FaceTime is really the only thing that they ever intended
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.880]   that front-facing camera to be used for.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.440]   If that's just the first expression of a decision to say, you know what?
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.000]   It actually would not cost us a whole lot of money just to by default have a camera in
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.400]   every eye device that we make.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.840]   And then there's a one-year plan and a two-year plan and a three-year plan for how to best
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   exploit those.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.200]   And the most obvious one, obviously, is going to be video conferencing.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.800]   I don't think-- I think that Apple is the opposite of these Android phone makers who
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.960]   will put the front-facing camera in but not give you a way to use it and just sort of
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.440]   hope that other people and other services like Qix decide to find a way to support it.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.920]   I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   FaceBookTime.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:52.400]   No, seriously, what if you were on Facebook and all your contacts were on there?
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.600]   And some of them had iPhones and you could press a button and you could say, "Hey, let
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   me tell you what I call my friend."
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   I don't even like people texting me on Facebook.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   Like the reason--
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   Yeah, but--
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   You're unusual.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   You're unusual.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.400]   The reason I don't go to Facebook is because every time I go, that people send me, "Hey,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   how's it going?"
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   I'm like, "I know."
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   You're not normal.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.200]   We both established-- you hate people.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.640]   The kids today with the long hair and the fled trousers and the bebop music with the
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.560]   electrified guitars, it's like a whole different generation.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.080]   When I read-- my niece is an nephew who's like, "Have friended me.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.920]   I'm that cool uncle that you were willing to friend on Facebook," or at least the public
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.240]   accounts, not their private ones.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.920]   And when they're talking to their friends, it's always a conversation, "Hey, what let's
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   Skype tomorrow?
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.560]   Hey, you're going to be around Skype tonight."
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.120]   And so that experience is really open to my eyes to the fact that Skype is really being
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:45.160]   used as a long place, replaced the phone as a live messaging system.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   Abby called me from her cell phone and said, "Skype."
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   And then we were Skyping.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   Every evening--
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.160]   So, so--
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   Every evening goes and video chats with his friends.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:28:00.000]   And so, something like a good terminology, Facebook time, or Google chat time, where not
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.080]   only do you see that little green dot that says, "Oh, by the way, the person who wrote
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.160]   this mail is available via FaceTime and simply clicking a button and having all the secret
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.440]   sauce connect you to the person."
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.440]   That actually could be a good way to actually make this relevant.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.360]   I think the problem I have is the form factor.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.200]   I just don't-- it's to hold that phone like that.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.240]   It's just like-- it's not something you want to do much of.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.000]   I think the problem for me is that I don't want people to realize that what I'm doing
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.360]   while I'm talking to them on the phone is cleaning my house.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   Like, that's what I do.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   Another good--
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.160]   Like, I don't really want-- if I have a video, then I can't do that anymore.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.640]   And I'm like, "Let me sit in front of my computer."
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.920]   Yeah, I do admit that's one of my problems.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   That's true.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.840]   I mean, as it is, I actually have-- if you saw my notebook here, I actually should keep
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.880]   a little square of Post-it physically covering up the camera because there are times when
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.200]   I'll be doing a company that'll be brief and you'll have a piece of software and they
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.680]   want to use some sort of flash-based live chat that automatically says, "Oh, well, I
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.840]   know it'll just show the camera for about two seconds before it gets turned off.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.120]   I don't want people to see my office for two seconds."
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.760]   Especially if they schedule the meeting for like 20 minutes before I woke up.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.960]   And I'm sick and it looks like, "Oh my God, it's sitting Nancy."
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.080]   Well, and we shouldn't forget that Annie's does those naked hula lessons of a Friday
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   afternoon.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.880]   Right, and sometimes you forget, I mean, you have a meeting running right into it.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.440]   We had the little lavin last week just by the blooper for Rich.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:21.480]   Anyway, but this ties into the Facebook phone rumor, which I have to say I think is completely
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:27.680]   a Mike Arrington fabrication, but there is some credibility behind it because Joe Hewitt
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.800]   who was at Apple and is now at Facebook and is an expert in, he wrote the Facebook app
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.240]   for the iPhone is an expert in this and a big Android player are both at Facebook right
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.600]   now, presumably heading some sort of mobile division.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.680]   Mike Arrington said, "Based, I think mostly on that, maybe he has a tipster.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.440]   You never know with Mike, but Mike on Sunday posted a story saying there's going to be
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.960]   a Facebook phone.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:57.120]   Facebook didn't even give him one day of news cycle, one day of a link bait on that
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   one.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   They said, "No."
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   Right away.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   No.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.120]   And I think that a phone application makes sense for Facebook for both, you know, and
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.080]   getting really integrated with that with Android and the iPhone makes a lot of sense for Facebook.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.680]   Building their own hardware makes no sense.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   Well, of course, this is TechCrunch justification.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.160]   MGC G-Siegler and TechCrunch says, "Yeah, but Apple said they weren't doing a phone until
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   they released it.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.560]   Google said they weren't doing a phone until they released it."
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.960]   Well, that was because both these companies had reasons to want to get it to the phone
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   market.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.880]   Facebook seems to have none, especially now that, I mean, Google's foray into phones
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:38.480]   made a lot more sense after Apple said, "Here's what you do with a phone that's 100% touchscreen."
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.400]   Google then said, "Here's what you do with an operating system that you can base not only
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.960]   is free, but also you're pretty much free to build whatever you want on top of it or
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   through it."
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.880]   So if Facebook really wanted to prosecute that idea now, I don't think they would go
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.800]   to the trouble of contracting with HTC or Samsung or anybody to build a Facebook logo
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   phone.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.640]   I think that they would essentially come up with a list of the five best-selling Android
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.920]   phones and say, "Here is an app that will..."
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.400]   If you're not happy with the Verizon face that's been put on this, on your phone, all
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.120]   those custom apps, just basically dock it in this app, we will replace your copy of Android
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.840]   with our copy of Android that is incredibly optimized for Facebook.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   Facebook.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840]   That makes sense.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   Exactly.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.000]   All they'd have to do is take care of two Samsung phones and four HTC phones, and they
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.160]   would have 80% of what they would get out of a Facebook phone with only 5% of the hassles.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   Yep.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   Yep.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.440]   It's understanding what your business is, which in Facebook's place.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.280]   In fact, every time Microsoft edited a foray into hardware, it was a huge mistake for Microsoft.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.560]   They never really understood that they're really a platform company.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.960]   They're a software company.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.320]   They are not a hardware company.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.560]   They've made money on hardware, but not as much as they've made on software by any means.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   It's just such a different world.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.000]   It's like saying, "Is there going to be a Twitter phone?"
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.680]   No, but I like Iandy's idea of a Facebook-centric, even OS or modification.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.880]   That's a great idea.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.400]   And I could totally see Facebook doing that.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.440]   I mean, I think the only argument for it is that they have 500 million users or a billion
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.160]   users or whatever the number is now.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.000]   If 1% bought it, it'd be a lot of phones.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.640]   But the other thing is that it's really hard to parse these rumors that are based on a
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.240]   company that has more money than God and his mom to put together.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.000]   Because it's even possible that they have built a Facebook phone just to see what it
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   would be like.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.240]   For all we know they have a Facebook refrigerator because they've got the money.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Right.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   And they could do it.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.600]   They could spend $500 million on a phone just to see what would happen.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   Right.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   It could just be R&D.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.360]   They'd be really great notional Apple Museum of products that we've confirmed that they've
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.160]   actually built just to see if they would work, but then never actually followed through
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.680]   on, including going all the way back to.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.120]   Wasn't there a Sony Zias or something like a Japanese only like sort of Palm top that
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.680]   they actually successfully got Mac OS running on just to see what would Mac OS look like
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.880]   on a $199 piece of consumer LCD hardware.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.800]   Well, that leads me to a rumor that's going around.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:12.000]   In fact, they asked me this morning on my regular radio hit on KGO in San Francisco.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.640]   What about this seven inch iPad?
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.160]   And it's so interesting because mainstream media doesn't really know how to parse these
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.560]   rumors.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:25.120]   And so I always have to say, well, if it were from Apple, then, but it's not because
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.800]   Apple doesn't pre-announced.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.280]   And so it's just a rumor.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   Maybe they're going to do it.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.800]   I could see maybe they might want to.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   I don't see it.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.080]   I think there is a seven inch coming.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   Really?
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.120]   I don't know when, but I think there is because I think that there is a large gap between
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.240]   the price and structure of the current iPhone 4 and the entry level iPad.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.880]   So I think that there is a there's a two 99, three 99 device there.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.680]   I know that I would actually today, I would actually if you gave me a retina display,
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.920]   so you kept the same resolution and just made it smaller, I would prefer a seven inch over
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:02.360]   the current size because it's just it's a little bigger than what I can put in my little
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   Scotty best easily.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.480]   Now, I think the seven I think Samsung did an interesting call by building a seven inch
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.960]   tab because that's one way they can instantly differentiate themselves from the iPad.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.640]   And there are a bunch of people who think that 10 inches is just a bit too big.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   They'd like to have something that would fit in some sort of pocket, even if it's just
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.080]   a back pocket.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.840]   But for Apple to have both a seven inch and a 10 inch, they would have to be presented
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.600]   with overwhelming evidence that the reason why a lot of people are buying the Samsung
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.560]   tab or any other seven inch tablet instead of the iPad were because of the size.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.280]   I think it comes down to the reason why if you go to if you go into a shoe store, they
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.520]   might have a pair of red shoes, they don't make it available in four shades of red.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.640]   If you want red, here's red.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.520]   If you don't want red, here's another here's another color.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.200]   So as it is, they're going to say here is the here is the screen size that we decided
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.800]   was optimal for this device 10 inches.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.880]   If you want something portable, but what do you know, we get something that's even more
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.160]   portable than seven inches.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.480]   This iPod touch will fit in a shirt pocket.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.800]   I just don't think that seven inches is small enough to really answer the question that
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.240]   I want something that is super, super portable.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.640]   I think that I just feel like there's a lot of places where I would love to have a seven
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.040]   inch and the 10 inches is just a little bit bigger than I want.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.800]   And I just find it to be just this in between that I go, oh, yeah, I could really, you know,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.080]   with the one argument in favor.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.720]   And I don't know how credible it is, is that they did do this with the iPad.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.280]   iPod, didn't they?
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.560]   They made three, you know, like three sizes of iPods.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.640]   And there's, and there's this, and there's it right away.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   It was, wasn't it?
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   It wasn't so much.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.720]   They made three different sizes so much as they made them for three specifically different
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.880]   kinds of users.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.200]   Well, there was, there was the, there was the, what's, well, first of all, what three
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.920]   sizes are you thinking about right now?
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.960]   Shuffle, nano and classic.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960]   Okay, perfect.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:48.240]   And you have the classic, you have the, you have the touch for people who want an iPad,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   only, only smaller that runs apps.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.120]   You have the classic for people who want to carry their entire music library with them.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.880]   You have the shuffle for people who just want something simple and cheap that sinks really
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.800]   nicely to their iTunes library that they can, what they can wear while working out.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:06.440]   And then you have the nano, which is the basic, the, the, the inheritor to the standard iPad,
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.640]   the iPod classic.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.400]   So we're not talking about, I want something that's a little bit larger than this, but
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.720]   not so as small as this.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.800]   We, it's the idea of four specifically different kinds of users until, until and unless Apple
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.040]   could say, here is the person, here's the type of person who wants a seven inch iPad,
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.400]   then that's never going to happen.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.200]   And at least not from Apple.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.720]   I'm, I'm kind of with you.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.080]   I did, I did, I did, in fact, that's what I told KGO.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.920]   I said, it seems unlikely, but that is the one argument is that, you know, maybe, I just
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.080]   feel like there's a, there's this steady transition from tiny and cheap all the way up to the
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.240]   iPad and there is one gap.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   Right.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.160]   That's, so either they make that, that iPad less expensive, which is possible.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.240]   I think that they have probably enough room in the margin to do that.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.120]   Or they, you know, there's, there's a three 99 there that, that an Apple has been so good
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.040]   at keeping that gradient so nice and clean, smooth that there, to me that that's, there's
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.080]   a gap there that they're going to fill somewhere.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   And January.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   And just be cheap.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   And January.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.400]   We don't, nobody does either of you credit the idea that there might be a update to the
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.680]   iPad sooner than January.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   No, I don't.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   I don't think so.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   Okay.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.440]   We all, if you're getting something for Christmas, you should just get it.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   We're all in agreement.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.640]   I don't, I'd be extremely surprised because the, the real trajectory for that would have
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.080]   been September, the September event, you know, and the thing we're looking for, I think
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.820]   in the iPad, if we're going to look for something as the, is the front facing camera, but I
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.560]   think that'll come in January, February, March.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.640]   And I think most likely the ship date, if I was going to bet money on it, I'd say the
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.200]   end of March, early April, it'd be a one year.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   Apple doesn't tend not to rev things faster than a year.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.280]   I agree with that.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.200]   I think that if there'd been more aggressive competition from Android tablets of the course
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.400]   of the year, Apple might have thought about doing some sort of a stunt that would sort
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:51.480]   of reduce interest in the iPad, but there are no functional competitors to the iPad yet.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.120]   And it's, and nearly again, it's September now.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.920]   Sales are now so low that you can actually go into a store and buy one maybe.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.920]   And so low, they may even have one in stock.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.920]   Right.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.560]   I mean, they've just, they've just, wow, that must be a disappointment to them.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.560]   I know it's like, I get the other, exactly.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.920]   I don't know if it's 50 dollar bills instead of.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.760]   Now they're, now they're blowing their nose, noses with a hundred dollar bills instead
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.600]   of lighting cigars with them because they still, they can still watch them out and they
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   want it.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   They might want to keep it this time.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   Is it true?
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.120]   I read a report that, that Apple now has more cash in the bank than any other corporation
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   in the United States.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.600]   And any other corporation in the history of the world?
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.280]   No, I don't know.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.980]   I haven't, I haven't checked that out, but that Apple's part of Apple's urban, urban
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.640]   legend now is that they can really buy their way into or out of anything they want now.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.560]   So that's why, that's why, that's why it's hard to come up with a rumor that simply says
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.040]   that Apple has built this that I would say, no, that's ridiculous because if they, if they
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.400]   said that, you know what, that, that, that for a, for, for rotor, iPhone controlled helicopter
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   looks great.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.880]   Steve Jobs wants to build one that can carry two humans.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.440]   I would say, I don't think they'll make that as a product.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.720]   I'm not saying that they couldn't afford to actually do that if they wanted to.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.920]   I mean, spaceship, when you think about how much money they have, consider that spaceship
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:18.080]   won the first private spacecraft to take a human into space, took about a 20 or 30 million
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.360]   dollar investment.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.840]   And that's like, that's the month, that's the amount of money they made on iPod socks
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.680]   three years ago.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.120]   So, okay, moving along.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.040]   Man, do you think they made money on iPod socks?
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.520]   That's, that's incredible.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.480]   I always look at those and I'm like, what?
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.920]   I remember going to the event in Cupertino.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.560]   In one infinite loop that was one of the last events I was ever invited to.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.840]   And they, they announced, you were there, I think.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   Yeah, we were there.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   iPod socks.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.000]   And we were like, and the apple high five.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.560]   And then we moved on to the high five because we did like, we're like socks socks.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   Let's talk about the high five.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.240]   And this is the event where Steve Jobs said, I'm throwing out all my stereo gear.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.000]   The high five is so good.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.520]   You know, we still use ours in the office.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   Really?
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   You have one.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   We have one.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.520]   We have one.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   I have one.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.040]   That's my kitchen, my kitchen radio because there's an iPod high five.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.160]   The chief guy at Best Buy says I was wrong.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.480]   I take it back.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.400]   Man, you could just imagine the phone calls he received after he announced that Best Buy
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   was hardly able to sell laptops anymore because everybody was buying iPads.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.640]   At which point, of course, he got it called by Acer HP, stop, Dell, Asus, and said, are
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   you crazy?
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.200]   We're never going to sell you another laptop again.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.400]   If you say that again, pull it back, pull it back, pull it back.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.120]   It does not matter if it's true or not.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   Just don't say it.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:46.040]   I think it was more like now to get to the office max from the Best Buy and Venn.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.520]   Do I take the L or do I take just a left from there?
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.320]   Oh, they're actually OK.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   No problem.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   Analysts are now.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.600]   Now, properly chastised are saying the iPad will slightly cannibalize laptops, but mostly
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   Mac laptops.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   Right.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   Right.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.000]   But you look at the numbers.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.600]   And last year was exceptionally a good and exceptionally strong year for notebooks, especially
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.920]   in netbooks because there was so much.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.440]   There was still a netbook prices that dropped by about $100 to drop them down into the $200
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.040]   range that had actually also driven the prices of real Windows notebooks down to the $500
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   range.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.200]   There was always a really broad spectrum of prices available for Windows notebooks, but
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.800]   you could get a really good Intel Core Duo net notebook for somewhere between $500 and
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   $550.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.840]   And everyone I've talked to about that has said that this was sort of an Olympic year
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.560]   for notebooks.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.200]   It was a really great year and they were not expecting that 2010 would be as good.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.240]   So I think those initial reports came from the fact that, OK, iPad got announced in April
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.560]   and now notebook sales are down at least 18% across all makers.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   Cause effect.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   Right.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:05.160]   Which we know as says, who took two weeks of a logic class that no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   it's false correlation.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.160]   It's a correlation.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.720]   correlation is not Socrates is a man.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   Ergo.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   Ergo.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   Ergo.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   Proter.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   Yes.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.120]   I still think it was West Wing and not college.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   Did you?
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.400]   I was going to say, did you learn that from West Wing or did you?
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   That was actually a title of a West Wing episode.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   I remember that.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.320]   All I can remember from Latin is quid pro quo.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.920]   I can remember hic haic haic haic we as we as we as we can.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.420]   Oh, ho ho ho.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.420]   Mo.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.920]   Don't know that as do he's an interest part.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   Yes.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.440]   And quality so or bito all of gollist is so I survived in three parts France in the North.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   Three parts.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.000]   Caesar to Brute.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.080]   It's a movie sub movie and I want to accept that to read us.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.640]   Did you, so you all took Latin?
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   I actually.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   We all took.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   Yeah, we all did.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   We really did.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   Two years.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.960]   Either Spanish or Latin and I decided that Latin had a bigger future.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.760]   Oh, and you were so right.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.560]   Well, Latin because I had those simultaneous translations where you could read like the
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   Latin and the English.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.120]   That's why I read the English parts.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   Wow.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.960]   I could just spend the entire semester reading a book about people killing other people and
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   setting fire to children.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   Awesome.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.200]   I think I can get by very well without knowing how to ask for where the pencil is in the
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   library.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.440]   I wonder if they do they teach it at all anymore or is it just a I remember my Latin teacher
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:33.080]   jumping through great hoops to show how useful Latin was and the really the only it actually
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   was useful.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.560]   It's really great for language.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.000]   It's helped me a lot in romance languages.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.680]   It's great for crossword puzzles.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:46.800]   But the only justification he could come up with was once he was on a boat and he was
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.440]   trying to speak to a Spaniard who didn't speak English.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.880]   He didn't speak Spanish, but they both spoke Latin.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.440]   There you go.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.840]   It's a stable language.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   It's not changing.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.160]   So that's that's it's it's it's stable.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.040]   It's not not moving target.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.800]   And I the biggest thing that I learned was how to memorize in London.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   I think that's a huge value to it.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   So I got really good.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.000]   And when I was when I was an actor many years ago, it was my Latin training actually became
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.400]   very useful only because I learned how to memorize lots of things.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.720]   I didn't know what I was saying.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.360]   So some question we were talking about Facebook on the unofficial Apple web blog about whether
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.400]   FaceTime is blocked by some carriers in the Middle East.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.080]   The original story was FaceTime goes missing in Saudi Arabia and much of the Middle East.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.320]   But then an update this morning says, well, several commenters have said either a I already
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.120]   have an iPhone in country X and FaceTime works fine or B I work for the cell carrier in country
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.840]   Y and we're not blocking FaceTime.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.040]   How can you block FaceTime if it's over Wi-Fi?
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.320]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   That's my question about it.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   I saw that go by.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.840]   I guess the carrier could disable it.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.720]   Well, once you have a FaceTime connection, it's it is.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.120]   In fact, you have to decide you don't want to talk to that person on the phone because
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.880]   when you as soon as they've made that FaceTime connection, if that person's on a FaceTime
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.960]   on a Wi-Fi and you're on a Wi-Fi and you hit their name, it doesn't try to call them
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.600]   at FaceTime.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.640]   So what happened was that there was a Facebook posting from Saudi Mac.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:18.800]   The website had graphics for several countries in the Middle East that lacked the FaceTime
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.160]   graphic.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.760]   However, these phones are not yet out there coming out later this month in the countries
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:32.400]   and no one knows whether it's a cosmetic tweak or in fact the feature will be blocked.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.880]   So I think it's really a kind of a tempest in a teapot until we actually see those phones
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.840]   shipping, which is not till later in this month.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.400]   So I don't I China's going to get the iPad.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   I'm sorry, the iPhone 4 in September.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.400]   September.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.240]   Yeah, they're going to have a fun time now.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.560]   That's that if a fun blocking that.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   Yeah, that's going to be interesting.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   Well, do you think they'll block it?
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.800]   I mean, I was able to use Skype in China.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.120]   They'll block something.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.040]   That's what they do.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.640]   It's just going to be an on and off sort of thing whenever there's something going on
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.800]   that they're worried about people talking to each other and ruining a situation.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.960]   Then that's when suddenly something's going to stop working.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.680]   I think what's interesting about video and FaceTime and anything with a camera streaming
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.680]   is that a lot of the blocking tools are designed to find text.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.120]   And even if you're talking, a lot of them are designed to identify what you're saying.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   So it's doing the transcription issue.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.840]   But if no one's talking and you're just shooting a scene, it's very, very difficult for them
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.680]   to I mean, that can be done.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.520]   But the post processing required to do that is much more complicated than doing speech
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.200]   recognition or text recognition.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.640]   And so I think that's going to be an interesting challenge.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.520]   I talked to a bunch of people in IT when I was in Beijing.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.320]   The way that they were trying to explain government control of the internet to me was that it's
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.840]   rarely that they're trying to find out what distance, what the dissonant movement is speaking
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   to each other.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.760]   It's more like, it's like Apple being run on a government level where they know that
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   there's a story getting out there and they can't control the story.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.080]   It's not that they want to, we want to make sure that a person A is not talking to person
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:10.160]   B. They want to make sure that they want to control a bad story becomes it before it
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:17.040]   turns into an uncontrollable blank storm of fact, unreality, rumor and panic.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.400]   They're actually very effective at that.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:26.040]   Whether the populace itself is compliant, which I suspect is part of it, you know, you build
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.520]   a strong middle class, people are, you know, have a sense that they can rise up.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.600]   They get a little less, less actions to stir stuff up.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.240]   Well, yeah, but it's, I think it's hard to control.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.200]   I mean, it's, you know, I think that's the issue in China is that you get these flash
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:39.720]   mobs.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.440]   I think they've gotten better at tracking is down.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.840]   But if you look in all parts, all kinds of parts of the emerging world, you know, people
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.600]   being able to use SMS can can rile something up really fast.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.320]   Well, the example that got cited was recently that was still ongoing when we were in China,
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:03.600]   where I'd forgive me if some of the details are incorrect, but there was a violent crime
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.960]   against a woman.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.360]   The rumor mill started that it was because a member of this one religious group committed
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.400]   it, which led to attacks upon members of this religious group.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   Then the police cracked down on that leading to the supporters of this religious group
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   to say, Oh, well, now the police are the government police is not supporting us.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.640]   And I was supporting these attacks and that led to people going against it even more that
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:30.560]   might have been sort of a sort of a rose colored glasses look at why Apple, excuse me.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560]   I have no idea.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   China.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   It's a very two two.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.000]   In some ways, it's very simple to the way that Apple likes to make sure they control
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.600]   the story that's coming out.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.520]   But it's interesting.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.360]   It's interesting when it's not so much a guy that I patch in a hairless cap, you know,
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.720]   stroking, they're speaking freely ideas that we do not approve of being discussed.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.720]   It's scary because this is the sort of thing that even in the United States, if you propose
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.520]   this as we've decided to conclude, at least in the LA area until the riots upside, we're
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.720]   going to turn off ISP access to these to Facebook, to Twitter and to these other social media
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.560]   systems because too much of the conversations are about things that are not true that are
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.760]   just simply fanning the flames until we put out some of these actual fires and babies
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.760]   are no longer being thrown into places where babies should not be thrown.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.920]   We're going to turn off access to Twitter.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.960]   I think that there unfortunately, there'd be a percentage of America that would say,
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.880]   yes, unfortunately, it's sad that we have to do, we have to give up some of our freedoms
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.880]   for safety.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.520]   But then again, this babies being thrown dogs on fire.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   We don't approve of that.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.520]   Those sort of things.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   They didn't have been frankly anyway.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.400]   Well, I think that there is a, I mean, they're laughing, but you don't know what you're
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   laughing at.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:41.120]   There is a, there is a, there's an argument for, you know, totally free press.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.600]   And I think that in our country, we've grown to position where that makes sense.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.960]   And you know, we grew, we got to grow up with it.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.400]   And we got to grow up with it.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.280]   So one thing we have to be clear of is that, is that we had free press the entire time.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.080]   We went through a lot of trouble when press wasn't so instant, right?
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.640]   You know, and so a lot of other countries are going through a growth pattern that we
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.720]   went through 150 years ago or 100 years ago or 50 years ago when press was slow and they're
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.800]   going through that certain growth pattern and they are less stable than we are.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:13.000]   You know, and, you know, and we saw what happened with slow press in 1929.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.520]   You know, and, and, you know, it would have been, I will argue that it would have been
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:22.640]   much, much worse in 1929 if we had today's whatever, you know, without, you know, it's,
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.440]   it is a things would have contracted much worse because there's a chain reaction that
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.080]   occurs, you know, in that, in that system.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.640]   And so, so I think that these countries, you know, I don't, I think that China goes overboard.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.120]   I think that China is not, I think that it's doing way too much to, and I think that it
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   can't do this forever.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   I think it can't keep its citizens bottled up and expect this to turn out what if people
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.160]   can't express themselves, what happens is they just get bottled up and then they explode,
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.720]   you know, and that's the, so that's what's going to, you know, that's, you got to titrate
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   it.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.720]   You got to slowly let the steam out.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.040]   Let people let their steam office is important is getting the information out, you know,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   and I think that's the.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:02.280]   Tell me in the chat room that the UAE blocks VoIP ports and FaceTime, or I'm sorry, I chat
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   ports.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.120]   So conceivably you could block the ports used on FaceTime.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.840]   And, but you know, this is why it's difficult to report on this kind of stuff because I,
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.960]   I had heard the same thing when I went to Dubai in the UAE, and yet I had Skype conversations
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.160]   with my host right before I went.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.600]   So none of this stuff is 100% in China to buy or anywhere.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   Right.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.800]   It's on and off, depending on the situation.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.360]   And what kind of connection you have?
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.480]   Well, and that's true.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.040]   You know, in a hotel probably in the UAE, in an American hotel in the UAE, you may have
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.520]   more privileges or in China, you may have more privileges.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.200]   So we, we're probably imperfect reporters on all these.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.480]   Let's take a break, come back with more.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.880]   We are talking about the Mac.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.200]   Of course, on Mac Break Weekly as we do every week, every Tuesday at this time.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.520]   Alex Lindsey and I Enoco and myself brought to you today by squarespace.com.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.040]   Another company that we all, I don't know about Andy, but Alex and I use heavily.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.640]   We use it for our inside twit blog.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.120]   I'm working, working to move my radio show to squarespace.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.560]   One reason is because squarespace can handle the traffic.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.600]   You can't handle the traffic.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.560]   Squarespace uses a really slick virtual server technology based on Java that allows them
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.800]   to pour on the bandwidth when it's needed.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.240]   That's actually something we, we are dealing with next week.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.680]   We're, we're shooting a new open for, we're shooting the video footage for a new open
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.480]   for Askininja, you know, coming up.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   Oh, I love Askininja.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.480]   So the ninja.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   So they still around you still doing stuff.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.800]   Yeah, the ninja is going to visit our office.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.720]   And so we're going to shoot some green screen footage and make it available.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:33.040]   And I was kind of like, yeah, I think we're going to make sure that, you know, like with
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.760]   squarespace, you know, that it's just going to, you know, that they could handle the hit.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.000]   You can't handle it.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.920]   But if you don't have it on that, it would be, you know, it's, and we're not sure, you
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.160]   know, the, with the media servers and everything else.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.160]   All right.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.920]   Because that part of our website isn't on squarespace.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   Right.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.320]   And so we're a little afraid, maybe we're like, we should have just gotten this all back
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   on squarespace.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:55.440]   This is, is both hosting because that's how they can do that and software, really great
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.800]   content management software that will, and I think this is very important, import and
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.920]   export from existing blogs.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.680]   So you're never trapped at squarespace and it's easy to move to squarespace.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.840]   In fact, you might want to try it right now for free for two weeks with no credit card
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.840]   needed.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.160]   Go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.800]   You can import all the content, including comments from your movable type WordPress type
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.960]   pad or blogger blog or anything compatible with those standards, which pretty much means
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   everything.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:26.400]   They've got great social integration and iPhone app to die for just beautiful stats.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.320]   We've talked before about the great design capabilities of squarespace.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.680]   You start with some templates, but you can do anything you want, including CSS and JavaScript
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   if you're so inclined.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.600]   And especially if you're just trying to figure out how to get your site up, how do, how do
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.480]   you just get something up that's going to work that you don't have to think about how
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.760]   to port it to a server or how am I going to write the code?
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.240]   Like I heard someone, I was talking to someone yesterday was talking about coding their site
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.960]   in and they had never done this before and I was like, you know, squarespace really makes
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   that a lot easier.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.640]   Just look at the examples and look at all the big companies and small ones that are
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.520]   using squarespace for their sites.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.120]   This is a valiant entertainment.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.680]   I mean, this is a company that visuals are very important.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.880]   And you'd think, I mean, it's a big company.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.320]   They probably have their choice of anybody.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.520]   They have a good budget.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   They could do anything they want.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   They chose squarespace.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.400]   Look how great this looks.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.360]   Those two squarespace blogs or sites look alike and that's because squarespace makes
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.560]   it easy to customize.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.720]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.880]   Go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.840]   Try it free for 20 days.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.520]   I'm sorry, 14 days.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.160]   If you decide you want to buy it, very affordable, by the way, hosting and software, everything
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.840]   you need, you can, oh, this is new.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.440]   Okay, they've redesigned this pricing page.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:46.240]   So there's monthly, yearly, two yearly, and to any plan that you pick, add the code Mac
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.200]   Break and you will save the additional 10% off of the life of your site.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.320]   Yeah, they've completely changed their packages.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.120]   This is, I haven't looked at this.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.400]   I looked at this a couple of days ago.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.000]   They must have just done this.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.440]   So the standard package starts at $13.33 a month by, if you go month to month.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.800]   And remember, the thing is, is they look at that price, but you would be paying something
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.080]   like that just for the host.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   This is everything.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.320]   And you still have to do all the work.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.760]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.280]   It's where great exceptional, wonderful websites begin.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.800]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break weekly.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.480]   All right, let me see.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.680]   I had so many other things I wanted to talk about today.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.880]   Somebody in the chat room said, because as I was going out, I said, the place where we
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:36.040]   talk about everything Macintosh, and he said, no, it's all iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.840]   Well, look, dudes, don't blame me, blame Apple.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.800]   They did do one thing this week in the Mac space.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.920]   They released finally the 27 inch cinema display.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.560]   I immediately ordered one.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.000]   And they made USB three available on what?
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   No, they didn't.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   No, I'm just wishful.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Blue, right?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   So angry.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   No, I'm so angry.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.440]   I just want to say, I just, there's only one thing I want on my hardware.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.920]   I'm fine with everything else.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   USB three.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   Really?
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   Just one.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   All my video.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.520]   So what's happening is the whole video industry is all everywhere.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.760]   They're all moving to USB three.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.320]   So all the black magic interface card.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:14.960]   The only reason that I can't interface professional video with my Mac mini is because it doesn't
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.200]   have USB three.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   Not that I'm bitter.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.200]   Oh, wait.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.880]   Or I have to use an express slot on my, so I have to buy 17 inch computers for our streams.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   Why?
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.480]   Because there's only an express slot on those and there's no USB three.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.800]   So it's just like, why is Apple?
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.880]   Apple usually is ahead on these things.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.360]   And I feel like they're trying to sandbag it or something or they just don't care.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.600]   But they really need to get their head.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   Unfixed there.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   I still am excited about the twenty seven inch display.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   I am sorry.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:45.600]   That's fine.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   That's fine.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   Thousand dollars?
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   That's a good price.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   I'm fine with it.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.520]   It's like it's like it's another monitor.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.960]   I mean, I, you know, I just, you know, I look, I'm with you and really, I brought this up
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.120]   to respond to the chat room, which is we would talk about Mac stuff.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.240]   We would love to talk about the next version of OS 10.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:05.000]   We would love to talk about all the updates to the Mac Pro and the Mac mini.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   And I like.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   And I like if there were any.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   And I work.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.960]   And I work if there were any.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.280]   I mean, it's all like scarecrow spray.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.680]   If I only had a.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   If there were any.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.680]   I mean, we would talk about USB three if they added it.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.320]   All I could say is that, but by the way, this is what's going on in the world.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   Right.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.760]   Every, I mean, what's Microsoft talking about today?
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   Not Windows seven.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.600]   I'm gonna talk about Windows phone.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.840]   This is where the all the excitement, all the innovation is happening is in the portable
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.840]   space.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.360]   The iPad's a huge hit.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.640]   Those new iPods are out.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.440]   The iPod touch looks fantastic.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.440]   I like the new now.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.640]   I've been using it for a couple of weeks now.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   Love it.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:49.720]   The iPhone four still hot, still not in white.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.640]   And the rest is just kind of background for Apple.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.480]   I mean, they're, I think, perfectly content to be selling max.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.280]   Supposedly, it's mostly about like acquisitions over the past four or five.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   Let's talk about the acquisitions.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.960]   You were saying how great their cash position position is.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.840]   Of course, once you have the cash in the bank, you're going to have to start spending it.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.040]   I mean, the two things that have been big in the news of the past week and it's actually
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.560]   in the show notes too.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.480]   They bought a face recognition company called Polar Rose, one of those companies you really
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.360]   haven't heard of until they get bought by somebody and then you absolutely, then you
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.000]   hear about them because they got bought and then you never hear from them again because
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.920]   all their technology is now in the world and in other apps.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.640]   Actually, Google has two weeks ago made a face, face recognition acquisition as well.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:36.840]   So this is, it's kind of almost in lockstep, you know, in terms of acquisitions, whether
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:41.280]   it's ads, speech recognition, you know, with the artificial intelligence.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.960]   And Apple already does a lot of facial recognition within Apple.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   So does Google.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.960]   The companies had this technology.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.160]   They're getting the engineers, right?
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.160]   Right.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.960]   And that's why it's so interesting to sort of think about what they could be doing with
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.640]   this sort of stuff where the thing that Polar Rose is known for is that they do face recognition
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.800]   within video.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.640]   So maybe they're trying to figure out how to add that sort of featured eye movie or maybe
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.800]   they're trying to figure out a way to just like I said, the camera, the front facing
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.080]   camera on the iPhone obviously can be used for live chat, but could also be used things
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:16.320]   for like verifying who you are before it allows you to use your iPhone or in a P in an IMac
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.160]   it could say who is in the room and can I log these people in automatically because I
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:24.760]   verified that the butt of that guy who's bending over and cutting open a cutting open
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.080]   a box from FedEx.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.400]   That looks like what is the text is on Levi's.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.680]   Okay, it says waste size 32, but it has a Sharpie that says that originally 38.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.160]   Okay, that's definitely Doug.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   Okay.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:40.600]   We will let Doug access these servers on the basis of that fraudulent Levi's tab.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.840]   Let me the other acquisition might be something that would even stimulate more conversation.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.760]   This is Roe v Corp.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.120]   Actually, it's not an acquisition.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.080]   It's a licensing agreement with Roe v Corp.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:54.720]   They focus on making interactive TV guides.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:02.520]   Unfortunately, that's like not that's not something you could apply towards.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.720]   Yeah, because I photo that would like to be able to arrange things in groups with text.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.800]   Like, no, that would be that they would have to.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.320]   Well, what if it's just for organizing your content?
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.720]   I know that's for live programming and deciding what to record and what not to record.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.520]   So that's well, maybe they're just maybe they're just like building something as a one off.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.960]   No, they probably wouldn't enter a licensing deal with this kind of a company just so
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.680]   that the guys in the lab could figure out what time the new house episodes air on the
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.080]   news super top secret Apple TV.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.840]   Gene Munster, Piper, Jeff, who's a big advocate or believes strongly as Jason Calicana said
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.480]   that Apple will do a TV in the future says this.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   Prose it.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:50.600]   He says, first of all, the interactive program guides at Roe v. do are the kinds of things
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.280]   you build into a TV set.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.080]   We believe says Piper, Jeff Ray, that Apple is developing a live TV and DVR features for
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.400]   an Apple TV product and will likely launch an all in one Apple television in the next
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.520]   two to four years.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.520]   That's a that's a nice safe bet, isn't it?
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.680]   You know, I think sometime in the 21st century, but I still think as we're going down the
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.880]   path of this, this eye, you know, having an all in one TV that had that ran the iOS that
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.680]   had eyesight built in, you know, have a live idea of an add on.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.520]   But I guess people don't want to plug in another box.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.520]   Is that the problem?
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.400]   I just I just don't think anybody would want to pay extra for TV features they may not ever
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   actually use.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400]   Right.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.160]   And I also don't think that we're at a place yet where Apple could simply assume that people
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.440]   want that kind of all of one functionality in it.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.920]   I think that it would be a great addition to a $99 Apple TV.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.440]   I'm not even sure even with IMAC's being used in dorm rooms that you would put a coax
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:53.240]   RCA connect, a coax connector on the back just to get HD cable TV signals in.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.080]   But I think that I think a Wi-Fi I think a Wi-Fi slash ethernet connection is all you'd
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.240]   really need into one of these things.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.320]   I mean, I think that the the IMAC, you know, the thing is is that I have to admit as an
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.080]   Apple user, I think there's a lot of Apple users out there that would start hedging that
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.480]   direction if it was big enough.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.440]   You know, so I think the big thing with Apple users is they'd want.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.720]   I think that a lot of people who would buy a special one doesn't want they don't want
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.080]   a 27 inch or 30 inch, they're going to want a 4650 or 60 inch TV.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.560]   But I know that I'm, you know, my my TV is getting a little long in the tooth.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.080]   I'm going to get ready to buy another one.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.560]   And if Apple put one out, I'd probably be at least look at it.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.280]   You know, I would need it to be 240 Hertz.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.560]   So I could run 3D.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.720]   I would need it to run the full iOS.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.880]   I needed to have an eyesight.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.720]   Those are the kind of things that those would be value ads that would get me to buy.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.000]   By the way, that's why I like that 27 inch monitor camera built in.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Right?
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Yes.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.360]   So I put my laptop next to it.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   I'm excited about that.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360]   I can't wait to get one.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.240]   I mean, I'm just the last two days have been not very happy for me because I don't have
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240]   USB.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   Maybe there's a TV built into it.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240]   Why not?
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:05.400]   I think that's why that's they that Apple would never build like a real Apple TV because
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.920]   of people like Alex and people like me and people like Leo, all of whom have different
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.800]   things they want to get out of a TV.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   I bought five bucks.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   I agree.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   That's why a box is a good thing.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.720]   Yeah, because over the past two years, I've steadily replaced all the tube TVs with HD
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   TVs.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.520]   And every time I get I put a lot of thought into the first purchase after that it became
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.600]   what does Samsung make that is within my price range that is 720p or ideally 1080 that is
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.120]   pretty much just within my price range.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.120]   Good.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120]   That's what I want.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.160]   And I'm not sure that I'm the sort of person who would spend an extra two or $300 to get
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   an Apple logo on it.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.280]   And then there are people who are willing to spend $800 extra to get an Apple logo on it
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   if it has these two specific features like why is this not 3D capable in the future?
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.680]   So I think that's a I think for me, the big thing is that I we were talking about this
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.880]   thing earlier is that I just want I just don't want to use any more controllers.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.160]   You know, I just want I want my iPhone or iPad to control the, you know, I'm so supposedly
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.880]   on this next Mac mini accrues in February, I am signed up to give a lecture on turning
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.840]   a Mac mini into a home theater PC.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:14.120]   But I just forget it on February, February, that's a dangerous.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:23.880]   Well, I would say turning your Apple device into your redacted into a home theater PC.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.800]   Yeah, I think that would be more that would be safer.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.360]   So so you guys do this.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.640]   Some some, you know, maybe Apple will before we got the Apple TV coming out, right?
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.080]   But maybe there's going to be even something more down the line with this new roviac.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.080]   Why would they?
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.680]   Why would they do a deal with Roe v?
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.360]   Where they going to build that in the Apple TV?
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.560]   It's just a program guide.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.200]   They got to be building up the Apple TV to a lot more than what it is now because it's
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   kind of pathetic.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.360]   I mean, they have a guide in the Apple TV.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.120]   I think the UI is is nice.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.520]   It's yeah, it's fine.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.440]   I'm not that I'm not that I'm going to get one.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.160]   The program guide is for live TV.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.240]   So you know, it's a Tivo style or DVR style program guide that you could have a record
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.320]   button on.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.760]   Why would you put what would Apple be doing with that?
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.080]   That's something they would add to Apple TV or is that something for another device?
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.400]   If you're looking at really replacing all the boxes that are in your house, live TV is
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.760]   the piece that is what keeps everybody keep.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   That's what keeps people.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   That's right.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   They're cable.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   If Apple gets live TV, it's the cable business.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.960]   Well, it's the end of value added, whatever.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   I mean, if Apple starts to go down that path, I mean, that's the and it's not just them.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   As Apple, it's not.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.560]   What if Apple did a DVR?
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   A DVR.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.760]   DVR is fine, but I think that the I think it seems contrary to the direction they were
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760]   moving.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.960]   It's like the hard drive out of the Apple TV.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.600]   Yeah, I don't think the DVR is as important as being able to watch football games, steal
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.760]   their games specifically.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.720]   You know, live is that's the only thing that has me go, well, you know, maybe I should,
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.200]   you know, get a, you know, have cable.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.640]   9 to 5, Max says it's just metadata for iTunes.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.640]   I don't buy that.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.360]   Yeah, I don't think that's enough.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:02.160]   No, because again, because what do you do with information about live TV, not past shows
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.880]   that have aired, but with live TV?
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.160]   So they already have metadata.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:12.400]   If they sign a deal with ABC to get to get the entire next season of whatever.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.520]   I believe ABC provides images and that was a bad deal.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.880]   They should have paid an extra 50 bucks to get the name of Hugh Laurie and all the other
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.120]   people who are on episode.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.560]   Oh, it's in that show.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.880]   We have to go out to get another party to give us the information.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.400]   I had something going on there.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.400]   Very interesting.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.920]   Let's see more to come in just a little bit.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.160]   There is a story that Apple spent according to the Silicon Valley insider, a year and a
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.920]   half trying to convince Facebook to do a deal over Ping.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   We'll talk about Ping and we'll finally give you a chance, Alex, to say why Ping is so good.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920]   Okay.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:57.200]   Ah, before we do that though, time to talk about backups with carbonite.com.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:02.240]   If you're not backing up with carbonite, I question whether you have a real commitment
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.000]   to your backup strategy.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.840]   Oh, sure you say I've got to.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.240]   I've been burning CDs.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.640]   I have a whole shelf up there or I've got a USB key or maybe you have a two terabyte
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.200]   external drive and you're using Chronosync, which is what I use to back up to it.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.240]   But let me tell you something as he wags his finger.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.480]   Let me tell you something.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.080]   What if there's a fire, a flood, a tornado?
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.240]   What if the burglar is breaking and steal every piece of furniture in your house including
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.240]   all your backups?
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.240]   What are you going to do then?
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240]   What will you do?
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.360]   My wife wasn't backing up.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360]   Of all people.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.240]   Well, it's the financial records of all people.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.240]   What happened?
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.240]   Did she lose it?
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.000]   Yeah, here's the deal is I stay out of my wife.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.080]   She didn't lose the data.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.400]   By happenstance, she had to back something up a week before.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.800]   So she lost a week of data and she's still putting it back together.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.000]   And so the thing is, what if you lost it all?
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Think about it.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   What if you lost it all?
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   How do you put it back together?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.960]   Going through an internal audit so that she had just posted the Quick Book stuff and everything
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.120]   else to our accountant and to someone, a consultant.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.760]   So it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but yeah, she could have lost it all.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.480]   And it would have been a really, yeah, I can't even imagine.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.960]   And the drive just went dead.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   It was like it was fine.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   And then it was not.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.520]   If you go to carbonite.com right now, that car leader, talking to you lady, go to carbonite.com
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.520]   right now.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520]   It's a great trial.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520]   You can see how it works.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.520]   PC or Mac.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520]   They have a great Mac client.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.520]   Although I have to say they've updated the PC client with 4.0.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.760]   It's even better on the Windows client is getting better and better.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.240]   And what they do is they're, I think they're a little behind on the Mac, but I'm sure they
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.520]   will be updating this soon.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.480]   Hey, let me tell you, it's automatic.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.120]   Unlimited backup for all your personal data on your internal drive.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.640]   You don't have to think about how much storage have I used.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.400]   Just whatever you got.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.420]   It's encrypted 128 bit SSL.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.240]   So you can even use it at an open Wi-Fi access spot.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.400]   That's why I put it on Abbie's laptop because it doesn't, you know, it's encrypted.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:03.200]   But if she wanted further privacy, she could use very strong AES encryption on top of it
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.400]   for complete privacy.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.760]   Less than $55 a year for everything.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.440]   And you can restore to any computer anytime as long as you can get online, even the iPhone
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.200]   app is free or the BlackBerry app free.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.840]   Your data is available to you.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.520]   You can, you cannot lose your financial records.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   Don't do that.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   Three places.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   Three places.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   One place that you're working on it.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   Yep.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.560]   It's either like a RAID 5 or a Drobo or something.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.240]   It's local, but it is redundant local.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   Yep.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240]   And then the third one is offsite.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.240]   You got to be, you got to have all three.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.640]   Peter Kroegs, three, two, one backup.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.400]   Three copies, two different media.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   That's important too.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.760]   You don't want to put all, invest it all into DVDs or something.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.960]   So you know, when I bought cheap CDs 10 years ago, it seemed like such a great idea
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.240]   except now I was going through them and there's like, they're flaking off and they're, you
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.520]   know, and there's like, oh, I lost the file.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.120]   These two different kinds of media, one of them, at least one of them has to be offsite.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.640]   It's simple.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   Everybody agrees.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   Carbonite's the way to do it.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.760]   That's part of your three, two, one strategy.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.400]   Carbonite.com, they were just named, I was really pleased to see it because I think we
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.080]   have a little bit to do with this.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.560]   The fastest growing IT services company in the US, the number nine privately held company.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.760]   Fortunately, they didn't give you stock.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.240]   That's all right.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.720]   I have emotional stock.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.280]   I have emotional equity in this company.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280]   Carbonite.com.

[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.320]   My.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   Why is Lily Allen suing Apple?
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.600]   Because she's crazy.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.520]   Her laptop was hacked into.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.520]   Oh, God.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.680]   No, I mean, I just, I didn't know.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.960]   I think PR because I didn't know who she was until I...
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.760]   Yeah, we all now know who Lily Allen is.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.760]   Who is that?
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   I didn't know who she is either.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.160]   She's a pop musician.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.720]   Did you know, Andy, you're kind of with it.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.880]   You're with the young people today.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   You're wrong.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   No, I hadn't.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   I hadn't heard of her either.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.720]   So I read this article and it was, Oh, God.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:08.520]   Because all the article says is that she claims her MacBook was, quote, hacked into.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.480]   And okay, does this mean that someone performed an exploit that installed a super user on
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480]   her, on her machine?
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.480]   I blame you Apple.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.240]   I blame you.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.640]   Or was it just that she left it open at Starbucks while she got herself another latte and somebody
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.840]   walked over and did some screenshots and emailed themselves pictures of their inbox?
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.960]   What, what, by hacked into?
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.000]   What if we all sued whatever company?
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.600]   I mean, that's like, and we'd be like the Beatles in the late days.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.600]   We don't want that.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.600]   We don't want that.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.280]   Maybe Lily Allen's going straight to Beatle them.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.480]   Yeah, but they, they, they sold a lot more albums.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   They're allowed to do that.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.280]   They have a certain level of okay, okayness.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   Okay, Nash.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.280]   Game loft.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.720]   They were the walrus.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   20 million paid downloads on iOS, 20 million.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.720]   Wow.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.840]   Is all I can say, by the way, they are also a big player on the Android space.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.480]   But that's, that's Angry Birds money.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480]   We're talking here.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.080]   I just don't think that they're angry.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080]   Not anymore.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   They probably angry at the beginning.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.240]   They have a lot of games, by the way, they did Avatar Iron Man check forever at Shrek.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240]   Not check.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:23.240]   Shucky, shucky for after live the life of Shecky Green in the early 70s.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.240]   He makes his way from Vegas large to Vegas.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.600]   That would be kind of fun.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.880]   Let's golf skater nation bridge.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.240]   Audis D near, you know, they have so many asphalt.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.320]   It's a very good game.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.600]   I like that asphalt racing.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.640]   That's why asphalt HD 15 more games on the way before the end of the year for the iPhone
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.160]   and iPad 15 15 more.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.680]   They do do Android and WebOS games.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.040]   They even do feature phone games.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.840]   They really, they they kill.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   They kill.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.960]   In fact, in May, they asked 330 million paid downloads across all platforms.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.440]   They're making some money, 20 million of them on iPhone.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   Wow.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.200]   Somebody's making money.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.800]   I'm just going to look at Angry Birds.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.960]   Angry Birds isn't a game loft, is it?
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   Or is it?
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.880]   It's a Ruby or?
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   Chillingo.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   Rovio.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   Rovio.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   I think there's-
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   I think there's-
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.120]   I should know because it comes up every single time.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.520]   I think they're Finnish or something.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:22.120]   When I look at the credits, it's like they're, it doesn't, it's hard to say.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.000]   I'm now on my second pass over to Angry Birds.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   Look at the credits.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Niklashed.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Rainmaki.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   Harugrenberg.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   Yako.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   Hisahalo.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.640]   Yeah, it's got to be Finnish, right?
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   Oh no.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.600]   I always thought the birds looked, you know.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.440]   Do they vaguely Eastern European?
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.440]   I don't know.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.720]   But what level are you at?
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.120]   I've already seen the whole thing.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.920]   I'm ready to play this on air and people mocked me.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.680]   They said, "Oh, you suck.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.680]   You're terrible at this.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.680]   This is how far I've gotten."
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.960]   Here's the worst part is that I got through the hole.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:57.960]   Two cans.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.960]   I don't do the two cans.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.960]   Hit it again.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   Hit it again.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   It'll come back.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Yeah, I know.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   But so you have to, what you have to do is you have to visualize a spline curve.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   I know.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.960]   And so you have to visualize, you can visualize, once you get used to-
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.400]   You can visualize a spline curve.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   So you just-
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.600]   This game is unfair at favors illustrator users.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.800]   No, no, no, it doesn't favor illustrator users because it doesn't use a B spline.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   That's a B spline.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   It looks like a B spline.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.600]   It's a hermite curve.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.160]   It's either a hermite curve or a B spline, but they're very close to the calculation.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160]   But it's not like a Bezier curve from-
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.160]   How am I supposed to get these two ones under here?
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160]   I'm supposed to get these two ones under here.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.560]   You have to actually hit those ones first.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560]   What Andy?
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.000]   No, no, because Alex was proven that he knew lots of tech details about Bezier lines.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.640]   I wanted to say the words like R-curve to an R-line to, which is the postscript markup
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.800]   language that I would feel like a big shot to.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.120]   Do you speak postscript?
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.800]   I learned to program postscript.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.120]   I bought like Don Lancaster's books, like in 1980s, whatever.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.960]   Back in the laser printer, right?
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.000]   Yes, back when those only way you do cool graphics on the laser on the laser writer.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.520]   Mcgruff says, "Great app, Leo just is."
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.800]   Well, I won't even say what he says.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.480]   I think I'm okay.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.600]   I'm now trying to get three stars on all of them.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.840]   Oh, you're that kind of person.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.120]   Well, I've already gotten through the whole thing going, okay.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.240]   They go to the head of some of those levels that you're like, "I never want to see that
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240]   one again."
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.640]   As soon as I survive it, as soon as I get it, I'm like, "Okay, I am moving on.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.200]   Now I'm going back and I'm three-starring everything."
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.880]   I got one or two, three-star on that level.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.320]   And sometimes you find yourself yelling at the application.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320]   You're like, "What?
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   Two stars?
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   Did you see?
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   I just knocked down the whole...
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   Well, I know!
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320]   I know!
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.320]   But first, first, first, first.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   How do I not get...
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.320]   And then what happens is here's the problem.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.800]   If you play it another 15 or 20 times for that level, you find that there is a way to get
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   three stars.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   And then you're like, "Is it...
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.560]   But it seems to me there's a lot of luck.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   It's not fully reproducible.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   It is reproducible.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   It is reproducible.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560]   It is reproducible.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.960]   But the level of detail on some of these, it is literally like a pixel.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   You have to pull that back.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.960]   You can't just kind of just pull it back.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.640]   What you have to do is you have to look at the grass behind you and you use that as a
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.920]   measure of exactly where you're pulling it back to.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.800]   I hate these three-in-two cans.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.400]   If you don't, and with the two cans, part of what you can do before you can feel it in
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.720]   the forest, you have to look at the leaves so you can kind of figure out where it is
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.720]   in the background.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.720]   I take it Andy, you don't play this game.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720]   But the background is very important.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.640]   No, I was just going to say that every week there comes a moment I realize that, "Gee,
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.480]   you don't play very many games on the iPhone or the iPad.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.520]   You should find a game to play that would really get you in that world."
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.080]   And then I listened to YouTube talk about your latest game of session.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.160]   I thought, "No, I think it's good that I'll just...
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.760]   I'll be like the guy who has the friend who owns the game."
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.760]   He's the ferret.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.720]   As opposed to the guy who owns the ferret and who's holding no stinks of ferret musk.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.760]   Generally, I only play this at like 10 minutes, like little like, "I'll play one game."
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.240]   And I'm like, "Okay, I'm done."
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.720]   But I couldn't go to sleep in London and I played for four hours straight and that's
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   how I got it through.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.320]   Thanks to our chat room, we have pinpointed the headquarters of Rovio.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   They are...
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.960]   I don't know why he used Bing for this.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.320]   They are in Espu, Finland, right there, right on the...
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.360]   So if you're listening right now, go and say, "Hi, Kahoosh is arriving."
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.440]   If you've got my phone for FaceTime, live video of people going in for lunch and leaving
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440]   from lunch.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440]   You know, it's funny.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.040]   Let's know that Mac breaks eyes are everywhere.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   Everywhere.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.240]   Watch where their activities are being noted.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.680]   You are being monitored in Helsinki.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.640]   I'm sorry, Espu.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640]   I'm sorry, Espu.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   Espu is...
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.480]   Which is the only Finnish word that looks like you know how to pronounce it.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.800]   ESP-OO is probably pronounced "Shardae."
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.600]   I mean, it's not, you know, there's something weird about Finnish.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.360]   They also have an office in California, I'm told, by our chat.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.600]   We're a brilliant chat room.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600]   We want to go there.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600]   We want to go there.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   We want to go there.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600]   Where's the Bing map of that?
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.360]   All right, time for our picks.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.720]   Well, okay, a couple more stories real quick.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:53.280]   Warner Brothers executives say 99 cent TV rentals, that's too cheap.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.400]   They want them to be more expensive according to Associated Press.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.520]   Gary Meyer, chief executive at Warner Brothers said his company decided not to participate
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:05.000]   in the 99 cent TV episode rentals because they feel the price is too low.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.400]   They said, "Just because it's dark and it smells bad here does not mean I have to move
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.680]   my head."
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   They want to charge.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.200]   Get ready for this.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:21.800]   Well, I guess, okay, Gossip Girl, you can own it for $2.99.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.000]   So I don't know what they want to charge.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.240]   What can I mean?
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.520]   I don't think they just want to make sure that people don't actually buy the shows.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.600]   We just want to make it high enough so that you don't buy it.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.440]   That's the comment of somebody who's 401k is wrapped up in like BitTorrent hosts.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.520]   And this just in Lily Allen and Warner Brothers are going to sue Apple because the price is
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.520]   too low.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.280]   No, I'm making that up.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.280]   Right.
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.280]   Right.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.320]   So I stayed away from some big product announcements thinking that perhaps you fellas might want
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.480]   to make those product announcements in your picks of the week.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.360]   So I am going to let you do your picks of the week right now.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:08.360]   And if in fact, you do not mention these particular products.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.360]   This is like a challenge.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.360]   It's a challenge.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.800]   I shall.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.520]   So for those of you sitting there saying, "Why didn't they say anything about, well,
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.120]   I was waiting to hear Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week, sir."
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.080]   I have an update pick and then a hardware pick.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   Okey-doke.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:31.240]   So my update pick, which I'm very fond of, is that there is a new version of Mac Dictate
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.200]   that just came out.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.200]   But it's now part of...
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.880]   See, isn't Mac speech the one everybody wants to use?
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.400]   Because it's got Dragon Dictate on it.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   No, no, Mac.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400]   This is it.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.320]   So this is the new one.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.440]   And so this is by Nuance.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:55.080]   So Nuance took over, Nuance merged or took over or whatever with Mac.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.320]   It was Mac Dictate.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.280]   And now it is now...
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.200]   It was I Dictate, I think, that was there before.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.840]   And now what they've done is they've merged a lot more.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840]   They've added a lot of things.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.840]   Here's the problem.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:13.520]   This is that I'm a big fan of both Dragon Software and also the Mac side of it.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.000]   Dragon Software runs only on the PC.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.680]   Dragon naturally speaking, PC only.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.720]   And what I'm excited about is this is now starting to move a lot more towards what's
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.720]   on the PC.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:28.320]   Because the PC version of this was much more robust.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.040]   And so one of the issues.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.120]   So now it's called Dragon Dictate.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.560]   And this is for the Mac.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.840]   And it's, I believe it's 199.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.600]   And they have a Mac speech, by the way, Dictate, Medical and Legal.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   Well, they've Dragon Legal.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.240]   So they've rebranded it a little bit then.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.280]   Yeah, they're rebranding it.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.320]   But I think that they're also adding a lot of the features.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.680]   So what was happening before was that there was a lot of things that on the PC side, if
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.840]   you used it before, you really liked the Mac side, but it wasn't as good as the PC side.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.720]   There was lots of little things about it that made it.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.400]   And so they're improving the accuracy, the responsiveness, and so on and so forth.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.520]   I've just downloaded it.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.520]   I am just training it.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.160]   It's really good on the PC.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.160]   I could say that.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.240]   I don't write any more than about two or three hundred words when I'm not dictating now.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.960]   Because it's, you know, and I use both of these.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:15.240]   I write really, really long stuff on the Dragon one on the PC side.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240]   I'm on the PC side.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.720]   I use, I'm now going to be, I'm testing this new Dragon dictate, but I got to tell you,
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.200]   you know, I have a lot of RSI problems.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:30.160]   So this has been a godsend for me to writing long form stuff.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.560]   And it does take a little bit to get used to.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.880]   You get used to saying period, comma, paragraph, that type of thing.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.400]   But once you get used to it, you do not want to go back.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.800]   Like you just don't, like you feel like, oh, I don't really want to type a long email
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.520]   because then I would have to, like if I don't have my microphone because then I would have
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   to type it.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   Right.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.080]   So it really is something that if you're having any issues with RSI, if you're having any
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.360]   issues with those types of things.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.400]   And the other thing I'll say is that you do it a lot faster.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:57.800]   Once you get used to it, you produce, I produce twice as much text in the same amount of time
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.240]   as I would, I don't know if it's better text, but it's, but it's twice as much of it.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:07.120]   So anyway, Dragon dictate is, and it's 2.0, but it's, it is the update for nuance.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.280]   And so definitely check that out.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.880]   My heart, my hardware pick, and I've talked about, you know, dictate before.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.280]   My hardware pick is a little bit more expensive.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.000]   I feel like it's my job to bring out some pro stuff that's related to the Mac.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.520]   And Leo, you might like this one or people listening that are working here at Twit.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.680]   So we use a piece of hardware by AJA that is called a key pro.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:35.560]   Now a key pro is a hard drive that connects to your camera and you're able to, so it's
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.720]   a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, the key pro is a device that lets you plug in your
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.560]   camera, whether it's HD SDI, SDI, HDMI, analog.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.280]   So you can do all of these things and you can plug it into your camera and you can record
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.400]   to Apple ProRes directly.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.560]   So it just records straight to Apple ProRes as a hard, hardware device.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.560]   You don't worry about it crashing.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.120]   You know, so we do a lot of our backups.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.040]   We will record isos to cameras, especially if you're recording long form, longer than
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.320]   what you have memory cards for.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.280]   You know, you, you know, we record to the key pro and it is an incredible thing, but
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.920]   it's a little big, like you can't attach it to the camera and it's $4,000.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.880]   So, so now we don't buy it.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.880]   We rent it.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:21.320]   So now, so you're recommending a four, no, I'm not, I'm not recommending the $4,000.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.960]   When I'm recommending the $2,000 version.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.720]   So there is another one that just was released at IBC and I got to touch it because I was
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.640]   an IBC in Amsterdam and it is called the key pro mini.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:38.840]   Now this uses compact flash, but it still brings in HD STI, still brings in HDMI.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.280]   You know, I, I've been going cheap $1,000.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.280]   Hey, there are people out there that are listening to our show that are professionals.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   I agree.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.280]   I'm an amateur.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.460]   And the thing is, is that this is like, if you're trying to figure out how can I get
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:54.840]   Apple ProRes directly out of the professional camera that I have, right?
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.400]   Or, or my little HDV camera.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.160]   Remember, you're getting an uncompressed signal out of your little HP 40 or HG 20 or whatever
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160]   it is.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.880]   You're getting an uncompressed signal out of the back of that camera, but you're not
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.440]   getting that because you're recording it to the internal drive.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.720]   If you want, if you're covering a corporate event or you're covering your own stuff and
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:14.600]   you want that better quality, that Apple ProRes quality.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.080]   I think you've recommended this before.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   I hate to say it.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   No, I've done the key pro.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]   This was just released.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.080]   The new mini.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   This is new and it's smaller.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.800]   You can actually attach it to the camera like a battery.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.800]   So you can put it in the back.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.800]   It's really small.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:25.800]   You can put it underneath it.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.760]   And, and I have to admit it was just, it was a thing I was probably the most excited
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   about at IBC.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.360]   And there was a lot of cool stuff.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.760]   So that's my, that's my pick for the week.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.760]   Okay.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   I can't do it every once in a while.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   No, that's good.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   I've been doing anything good.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   It's good.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   No, it's fine.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760]   There's a.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   Look.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.840]   But I have to say, you did not mention either of the two products I was thinking of.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.740]   So maybe Alex, maybe Alex is.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.080]   No, donuts for me.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.080]   No, donuts for you.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.080]   Maybe Andy and Akko will.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.580]   Here we go.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:58.400]   As of 12.01am today, I'm free to talk about the new versions of Adobe Photoshop elements.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.400]   That's, there you go.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.400]   There you go.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.560]   So there, there are two really cool parts of this.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.600]   I've always been a big fan of Photoshop elements because Adobe does a really commendable job
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:15.880]   of saying we've got this $700 professional photo and artwork production application.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.080]   What features of this are going to be most relevant to the, not just the average, you
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.840]   know, consumer, but also even people who are avid photographers with a bit of ambition
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   about them.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.920]   And they're not stingy about taking the best features, the most useful features out of
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.480]   Photoshop and putting them in Photoshop elements.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:42.080]   So the right now released today is Photoshop elements nine and the big, three big marquee
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.800]   features that have been added are now you get to do layer masks.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.320]   So if the edits that would be really, that are really easy to do in Photoshop, that worry,
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.480]   really tricky in elements are now really easy.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.440]   Like if there's a section of wall that has this really awful piece of graffiti behind,
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.240]   graffiti on it, but there's a clean wall like on the opposite side of the street.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:06.840]   Now to fix that, instead of hand laboriously, like hand fixing every single detail in that
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:10.920]   graffiti wall, you can just take a picture of the clean opposite wall, essentially cut
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.400]   a hole inside that section of the graffiti wall, then it's simply slide the clean wall
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.960]   behind it because you've simply masked out that part of the layer.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.200]   And so the back part is now peeking through.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.600]   It's one of those basic techniques that takes a half hour of just dip, dip, dip, dip, dip,
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.000]   editing and turns into cut swipe paste done.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:38.240]   The other cool things are that these are things that have been stolen from Photoshop 5, CSES5.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:45.240]   Now they have versions of smart selection and intelligent fill so that if you need to
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.080]   remove a figure from the foreground of an image, now that's the exact same code, the
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:56.080]   exact same algorithm that lets you intelligently just simply vaguely say, please follow this
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.440]   pointer as I move around and come on, you know the difference between the guy in the
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.440]   background behind it.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.440]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.280]   And you've selected it correctly.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.400]   That feature is now built into elements.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:10.040]   There's also the feature where they have the smart fill where it can sort of, if you have
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.440]   a blank part of the image that you need to fill in or patch up, it can look at the surrounding
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.440]   elements and make a really convincing patch and invent parts of the scene that will fill
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.440]   it in.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.920]   So when the coolest way to demo it is elements has a really good panorama feature and anybody
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:33.000]   who's shot panoramas knows that you never, it will never put it together so that it puts
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.240]   together a perfect square.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.760]   It's always where there's like a curve to this side of it and a curve to that side of
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.920]   it and a white space and usually you want to have it crop it way down in order to get
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.360]   like a full square frame.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:49.080]   Now with the smart fill features, it can simply replicate parts of the sky and parts of the
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:55.480]   ground around it and it will look 99% perfect if not 100% perfect.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.000]   It really is one of those magical features.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.600]   And it is once again the exact same code that's in the $700 CS5.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:08.360]   And the usual reasons for liking Photoshop elements are still there.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.800]   Lots of things that would be like a multi-step process in the big version of Photoshop are
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.040]   just simple wizards.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.200]   Like if you need to, the classic thing where you're wetting picture where the ex-husband
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.320]   is between two people you still like, you want to delete this guy and sort of smush
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.960]   these the other two figures together so that this guy never exists and to begin with, that's
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.520]   not half hour process.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.760]   That's just a once, that's a three step walk through wizard in Photoshop elements.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   They've also cleaned up the interface.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.840]   A lot of people complain that it's not very Mac like we're not even pretty.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.360]   So they made a lot easier and a lot easier to get through and still just 99 bucks.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.440]   And this is why I like third party editors like Acorn, they're 50 bucks.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.840]   But I like Photoshop elements so much because there's so much you can simply translate from
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.960]   the big addition to the small addition that to me it's worth the extra 50 bucks.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.600]   The only real limitation is that Rass Photoshop will let you edit in 16 bits and save to 16
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600]   bit images.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.440]   You're always limited to 8 bit saves.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:13.840]   So if you're looking to do like a magazine print quality like 10 by 17, you're probably
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.200]   going to notice a few little jib jibs when you're saving Photoshop elements.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.000]   But that's really the only big hitch.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.280]   Now the other huge news is that on the windows side they have Photoshop elements and premiere
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280]   elements.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.640]   The for ever since I movie came out Adobe figured that there's really no market in trying
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:37.360]   to sell a $99 version of a video editor if people are getting a copy of that for free
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.280]   as I movie.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:44.400]   I talked to Adobe has specifically told me that they've looked at the last edition of
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.760]   I movie left them convinced that there's a lot of people who are not really warning to
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.600]   the latest edition of I movie even though it's more than a year old now.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:56.880]   They also see how many people are using Photoshop elements for Mac and have been clamoring for
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.280]   premiere elements for Mac to return.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.440]   And now we have Adobe premiere elements for Mac again in version nine.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.680]   And it really is I would say I'm not a hardcore image of video editor.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:15.480]   But if you liked the old approach of I movie where you don't have this vague sort of timeline
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:20.280]   where you can't really make precise edits, this will make you pretty happy because it
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.360]   has that same sort of clip library approach to assembling things.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:28.040]   There's also a whole bunch of more pro-ish features.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:35.160]   One that I absolutely loved was really fine control of cleaning up audio.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:39.800]   Like there's after the World Cup and the move as well as started infesting every bit
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   of the TV coverage.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.640]   There's a whole bunch of tutorials on how to remove the.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.680]   For the background audio.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.320]   Now this premiere elements for Mac has six different tools for fine tuning audio like that.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:57.240]   So if you have a camcorder with like sort of really cheap sort of audio and you've just
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.800]   recorded something for some reason there was some sort of RF interference and there's
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800]   like little.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.920]   Like in the background this can filter it out.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.920]   No problem.
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.200]   Just just a few sliders with it.
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.720]   It also works with all Adobe.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.640]   Excuse me, most Adobe premiere plugins.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.920]   So if you don't like it's built in green screen at a green screen feature, you can add any
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:24.440]   commercial green screen feature or any third party plugin that adds Tinkerbell flashes
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.240]   of light and fairy dust.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:31.160]   All the other cool things serve the usual collection of weird effects that you might
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:35.720]   not use once every once every 100 shoots do.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.040]   I do like this really cool cartoon effect.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:43.240]   Like that video treatment they had in waking life where it looks like just pan cell painted
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.760]   animation like in multi tones.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.000]   It actually works pretty well.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.240]   So still 99 bucks.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.280]   Of course I haven't even begun to talk about all the features that are in there.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.080]   The real takeaway from this is that now I'm glad that there is an option to iMovie for
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:03.760]   if people who just have sort of a home use for video editing and they feel as though iMovie
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:09.280]   is not giving them the level of granular control that they would like.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.240]   Above all premiere elements gives you back that fine control.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.240]   Each of these is 99 bucks.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.520]   If you buy them together as a package it's 149 bucks shipping today.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520]   Really happy with both of them.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.720]   I'm really glad again just to see a competitor iMovie finally land.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.360]   It's actually huge.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:29.000]   If you'd asked me two days ago, will there ever be another premiere elements for the
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   Mac?
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   I would have said no way.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   No way.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.560]   In fact we're lucky to have photoshop elements.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.720]   So it's really good news.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.600]   And I think both are very very positioned in the pricing makes sense because you've got
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.800]   Final Cut Express on one side of it.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.800]   I want 19 dollars for both.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.800]   I'm right.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:46.560]   And then you've got iMovie on the other end but there are a lot of features in a certain
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:51.280]   work process that you get back for not very much money.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.280]   And it's very stable.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.080]   I definitely think it's worth checking out.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.480]   So good picks Andy.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:01.880]   That was two down out of the four or three new products I wanted to mention.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.880]   But there are two left.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.840]   So that's good because that gives me something to talk about.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:09.160]   One is an update, very much updated a version of Justin TV for the iPhone.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.920]   So now you can stream.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.560]   I am streaming right now onto my network.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.720]   It keeps getting a little bit of your own show.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.720]   I'm pirating.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.360]   In fact, that's what this is going to be great for.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360]   The next time.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   Next time.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.440]   You can go to Justin TV and watch the official stream or go to Justin TV and watch the pirate.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.360]   I'll be kicked out of the Apple of it for holding up an iPhone.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.080]   Whenever I'm in an Apple event, I always bring Justin TV and my iPhone so that I can stream
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.680]   live.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.600]   And it says it's switching to a lower quality version.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.280]   This is broadcasting for my iPhone.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.280]   There it is.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.280]   Yep.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.280]   Yep.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.080]   And I have to say it does a very nice job.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.200]   It's built into the iPhone.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.200]   Takes advantage of the higher quality camera.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.480]   It's still, you know, it's not perfect, but it's doing a pretty good job of the broadcast.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.480]   And I keep losing the network.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:58.000]   We're on Wi-Fi here and something's going on wrong.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.760]   You can even use the front facing camera if you should choose, if it's easier for you
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.720]   to talk to yourself with the front facing camera.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:12.080]   So I think this is, and it's free, Justin TV, just to search for that on your app store.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.640]   And then I think a huge one.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.880]   This really does show you that Apple has very much eased up on their restrictions on the
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.880]   store.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.360]   VLC is now available for free for the iPad.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.560]   VLC is a program that we recommend all the time for people who are having trouble playing
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.120]   back various videos on your Macintosh.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:31.040]   It's free from videoland.org.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.440]   But having an iPad version means, you know, all those pirated video, I mean videos that
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:42.240]   you downloaded from strange places in Divx or weird WMV formats now can be played on
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.240]   the iPad.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.160]   And that's actually really good news.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.800]   It's set up so that you connect it to iTunes and you can now, in the iTunes sharing panel,
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.280]   you can add videos of all kinds to your VLC player.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.480]   I don't know, boy, it's risky for me to go into my movie.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.880]   So it'll play, well, it'll play flash?
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   No.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.840]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.480]   VLC on the Mac will.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480]   So maybe it will.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   I don't know.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:14.280]   So I'm now copying over a PC perspective file that actually would play on the iPad.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.600]   But it plays a much broader variety of formats.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600]   It is free and it is a huge.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.200]   I think this is definitely, I think Apple has dissipated any SEC issues that they were
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:27.200]   having.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.280]   I think that all of this, like they've opened, done all the things that they need to do where
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.600]   it'll be almost impossible to take them to court at this point.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.360]   Let me just stream that on my...
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.280]   They haven't allowed flash, which I think is important.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.240]   I gave it probably VLC doesn't support flash.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.000]   It's probably the way that they got onto the store.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.720]   But it does support a lot of other formats.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:45.720]   Not still.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.200]   Somebody's saying not MKV, which is the Matrushka format, which is kind of surprising.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.720]   It's just a big deal because they could easily slap this down with the statement that we
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.200]   already have a built-in video player.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.880]   You can't really snap.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.600]   Not only that, but also the idea that it doesn't subvert iTunes, but it gives you a different
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.080]   path to putting content on the device.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.000]   Excuse me, putting video content on the device.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.280]   This isn't like there's been emulators that have tried to get approval through the app
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.920]   store that I'm like, "Okay, isn't it sweet that you actually submitted this to Apple
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.880]   for approval, but you know you're not going to get it?"
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.760]   VLC, I was aware that they had just submitted it.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.040]   I'm like, "If they approve this, we will have learned something about Apple."
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.040]   Huge.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.480]   But I do think that one of the key takeaways from a lot of this is the fact that Apple has
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.520]   released all kinds of things that they were normally blocking, making it much more difficult
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:40.120]   to have a legal case, but they have not allowed flash to go on.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.120]   So the issue that you get into-
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.120]   The big issue.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:48.400]   The big issue here is that that means it's harder for Adobe to push Apple's hand in that
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:53.040]   one technology that Apple does not want to support is that by doing all of these things,
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.800]   they did everything except for one little thing, which means that now it's very, you know,
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.360]   it's just very nebulous and it gives Adobe a lot less to grab onto.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.360]   Well, tactically, I think that that might be what's going on here.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.160]   I'm sorry, I'm doing another show on Justin TV right now.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:15.560]   Not only can he host and switch, he can do two shows at one time!
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.040]   Success has changed, Julio.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.240]   I hope I'm not the first person to tell you that.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:25.600]   Now, by the way, that copy is complete, and now on my iPad, I can watch this show in VLC
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.240]   as opposed to QuickTime, just as I've always wanted to.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.080]   I'm waiting now for Leo to have a second show where he comments on our while we're commenting
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.240]   on us without actually interacting with us in the show.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.200]   Alex Lindsay is so full of it.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.200]   Exactly.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.200]   Exactly.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.000]   But I'm not going to say that on the show, but behind the scenes.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.040]   Well, it always bugs me, you know, they used to do this on Anderson Cooper on CNN.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.440]   Erica is about to start her chat.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.240]   We'll continue on while Erica, and she's like talking into the camera over in the corner.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.880]   I said, you know, dudes, if your broadcast isn't good enough, why are you doing this
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.880]   back channel?
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.560]   Maybe you should make your broadcast a little bit better.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.400]   Anyway, there we go.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.400]   There you have it.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:10.680]   New products galore, a newer kinder, gentler, Apple.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.440]   And Alex Lindsay was here to document it.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:16.960]   Alex Lindsay is with the Pixelcorp, Pixelcorp.tv for the podcast.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.200]   But if you're interested in his great guild of multimedia artists living, learning, and
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.080]   working together, well, I guess they're not living together, except in virtual space.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:29.360]   Go to pixelcorp.com to join up and stay tuned.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.120]   You should both make sure you're subscribed to our mailing list and follow me on Twitter
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.960]   because we're going to do this great thing when we put files up from the Ask An Inja
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:41.960]   where people can build their own open next week.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:45.040]   It's going to be next week for Ask An Inja.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.320]   So we're going to be shooting some great green screen plates and putting them up in
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.280]   a variety of different formats.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   It's going to be next week.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.240]   And I'll talk more about it on the show, but you'll get them a little earlier if you
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.280]   are either following me on Twitter or getting on the mailing list with Pixelcorp.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.400]   And I'll let Leo know as soon as he can decide if he wants to tell anyone.
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.400]   But I'll let him know.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.400]   I sure know.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.400]   He knows it to the world.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.400]   And crush.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.400]   Well, you won't crush us because it's on Squarespace.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.400]   That's right.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400]   I will tweet it out.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   We'll see.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.400]   He'll just crush these.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.560]   Dane will be like, I can't believe I ever gave them open access.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.560]   No.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560]   Why?
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560]   Why?
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.560]   Why?
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560]   Exactly.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.040]   Sometimes, of course, that's where he writes on a regular basis.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.520]   He also has a great blog, C-W-O-B dot com and joins us every Tuesday along with Alex and
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:31.640]   me to talk about iPhones.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.120]   And maybe a Mac story once in a while.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.320]   I recommended a Mac application.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.320]   You did.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.320]   Very good for good.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.320]   There you go.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.320]   So did Alex.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   See?
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   See?
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.320]   Two out of three.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.320]   We did not.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.320]   And I started it.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:52.880]   On Facebook and Apple going 18 months in negotiation to get Facebook to accept ping.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.160]   That's according to Business Insider.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.160]   I don't know.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.160]   Wow.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.400]   And it doesn't look like we'll ever see Facebook on ping if they couldn't work it out after
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.400]   a year and a half.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.920]   If that story is true.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.160]   We'll save that for another day.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.160]   You can join us.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.160]   We do this show live every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.280]   Our live channel, thanks to Justin, as well as Ustream and BitGravity, is live.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.280]   .Twit.tv.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.280]   We give you a choice.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.520]   There's also, I don't know if people know this, but there's an audio version in this
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.520]   show.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.800]   If you're in the car or whatever and you want to listen, it's just like the radio all
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.040]   you have to do is get your iPhone audio onto your car's speaker system.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.840]   There are lots of ways to do that.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.040]   And then tune in, "Twit.am."
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:39.240]   "Twit.am" is the audio, streaming audio of the network.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:41.720]   And coming up this afternoon, more tech news.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:46.120]   We'll be talking about the Twitter hack and many other things with Tom Merritt.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.520]   It's TNT coming up this afternoon at 230 Pacific 530 Eastern on live.twit.tv.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.520]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.520]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.520]   Now get back to work!
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.520]   Break time's over.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:55.520]   [Music]
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.520]   [Music]
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.520]   [Music]
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:58.520]   [Music]
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.520]   [Music]
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:07.520]   [Music]
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:14.520]   [Music]
