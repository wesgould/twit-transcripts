[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.200]   news. We'll talk about Apple's quarter of a billion in the bank, the two million jobs
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   they've created in the United States, and the fact that they're the number one taxpayer
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.680]   in the United States, a little speculation about iPhones, and what is Apple going to do
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.080]   with Siri now that Amazon's Echo has a screen on it. It's all coming up next on Mac Break

[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.040]   I almost said Apple Soft. That would have been an interesting for an idiot. That's Andy
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.680]   Enocho, chortling in the background for the Chicago Sun Times. Hello Mr Enocho.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.040]   I sure wouldn't mind getting a version of Apple Soft with a disc jacket that has a floppy
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.280]   disc with magical angels wings flying. Oh, that was what it is.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.680]   The day is my friend. Also with his Renee, I guess Renee's underwater. He's there's flooding
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.440]   in Ontario. And he's manning the sandbags. You said he's on his Instagram. You can see
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.880]   is that joke? I was joking because he's always is 95% of his Instagram are really cool pictures
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.240]   of Apple watches. Right. And so I'm saying that I would know that I would know that that
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.120]   his city is on fire if there are like flames behind the Apple watch. I know that he's flooded
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.400]   if there's sandbags behind the Apple watch. This is how serious it is. There's no flooding
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.720]   pictures. Just a taco. So he's busy doing something sandbagging with tortillas, maybe
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.000]   yes. Also with us. It's Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core. Hi, Alex. Hey. Hello. Hello.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Good to see you again. Where have you been here since we saw you last? I have been.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.560]   Where was I? I don't remember. I can't I literally can't remember where I was the last
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:21.400]   time I was I was in. I was in LA. There was a music festival. And so I was there. And
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.160]   I know and I know that I was somewhere. So what handed you a clip? They said try this
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.680]   is not illegal. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Vegas. I was in Vegas for NAB. So that was where
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.320]   there before last. And then I know that I'm just I'm here. Please don't hurt yourself.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.240]   I think the travel is definitely affected my member. You know, I will say it. You looked
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.000]   like you've been at the fire festival. I'm not going to say anything else. No, no, it
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.600]   was my one piece of advice. My husband and my husband and his wife, your body for tattoos.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.160]   You look great. It's good to have you. Welcome. And also and by the way, Renee is in Quebec.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.840]   I don't know why I said Ontario. Quebec up north. Who else is up north? Adam Hanks.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.600]   He knows the difference. He's here from tidbits. And I understand. Congratulations are in order
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.400]   for two things. You're an old man and you ran a long way. What was that? So it's a it's
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.600]   a like a relay race. It's a really. So it's the back story. So I run this insane relay
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.440]   race. It's a 77.7 mile relay race around Seneca Lake and is a team race. So you have
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   seven people running, but you don't just run once. You run three legs each. And so it means
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.760]   like every two hours you have to run another race. And this is amazingly tired. You should
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.400]   look so much worse than Alex does. You didn't see. Yeah, the day afterwards, what it didn't
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.600]   look so bad, but I couldn't actually walk. So now is that one of the finger lakes? Because
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.760]   it looks like it ought to be. It is. So I am at the base of Kiyuga Lake of the next one
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   over. And our team is the Kiyuga seven because well, I mean, we got to make clear what lake
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.440]   is in charge here. So that's awesome. So we this year, this year, we had a mixed team.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.960]   So it's four men and three women. And we were going for the course record, the mixed division,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.880]   which we got. Unfortunately, the winning team beat our men's course record from 2013.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.800]   So we're we're on again for that one next year. I think. Have you ever considered running
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.880]   the Barkley? What's the Barkley? Oh, I think Adam Adam probably knows about this. I only
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.480]   know it through the I only know it through the documentary and reading article. Oh, the
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.760]   Barkley, I know what you're talking. We talked about that. I am not that not. So I mean,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   this this race is this race is bad enough. And but any event the connection with Mac break
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.640]   weekly was, you know, I'm completely destroyed at the end of this race, hanging out with
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.880]   my friends and the team in the parking lot. And this guy comes up to me another runner
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.440]   in the race and says, Are you Adam Hanks? I think I saw you on Mac break weekly. And
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:19.400]   and my friends for the most part don't know what I do. So they're just like, huh? What
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.800]   are they talking about Adam? We thought you were a dentist. So no, no, one of my friends
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.760]   wife's the dentist, but they know I do computer stuff, but not so much that. But can I mention
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.680]   the other thing that you're to be congratulated for? Is that public knowledge? That is indeed
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.840]   public knowledge. Congratulations. You sold the book division from tidbits. Take control books.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.680]   We did. We did. We sold take control to Joe Kistel, our most prolific author and in fact,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.360]   the author of the very first take control book. And so his company Alt Concepts has as of May 1st
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.680]   taken over take control books. He calls it 2017 the year I take control. And we did in fact do a
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.280]   fake book cover of take control of take control. So that's really great. I think for both of you,
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.240]   I really congratulations to Joe as well. Yeah, it's I mean, this is it's one of those things
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.880]   where we've been doing this for 14 years. And that's a long time to be doing the same thing.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.720]   And so Joe turned 50 in January, time to turn 50 later this year. And it was just it's one of
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.000]   those times you start looking at your life and gone, man, is this what I want to be doing for the
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.240]   next six years? And so it was a it was a nice idea that we came up with like, ah, this is a way that
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.920]   we can keep everything going. All the authors, all the editors and all the readers keep getting
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.120]   what they like. And so that just it's a big win all around. And we're really looking forward to
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.080]   all the the energy that Joe's going to bring to it because we were we're burning out a bit at the
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.520]   end there. Yeah, that's hard work. And you tidbits of course takes a lot of your time.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.040]   Tibis does. And we've we've started this new tidbits content network thing for syndicated content
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.920]   for consultants, Apple consultants and resellers. And that's been fun to like do something new
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.680]   again. And like, I got to go back and release a book. So it's nice to give give that off to Joe.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.480]   But also you got I mean, really, I mean, I'm so I've always been so impressed with what you and
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.600]   Tonya have achieved just in general, like as a family, as a business as writers, as business
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.160]   people. And I remember I was it was it what what what conference was at some conference or another.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.120]   I remember you pulling me and somebody else into like an unused conference room. And even though
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.800]   no one can hear us in what almost a whisper saying, okay, we're starting a publishing company.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.280]   It's going to be called take control. And we're just like, okay, wow, that's great. You're publishing
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.000]   like nuclear secrets. But it was like the enthusiasm from day one was like, oh my god,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.960]   this is going to be super, super awesome. And the fact that like this, this isn't this isn't
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:00.840]   like selling off like a cold plant that's dead. Because the industry is dying. This is you this
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.320]   is you've you've maintained this and built this into something of great value that someone who has
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:12.120]   a new that has unduplated stores of energy can now lift it off into the next orbit. So that's
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.480]   really exciting. In some ways was we got to actually have a business for all of our friends.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.400]   You know, there's good parts of bad parts to that. But you know, but but on the you know,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.360]   sort of overall, it was really great that it was like, hey, we get to work with people we've
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.320]   really enjoy and do cool stuff. And so that was that was a big win.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.960]   Well, he is is not is not starting a business with all your friends. It's keeping them all your
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.000]   friends after you start a business together. That's that's the that's the hard part.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   Tell me about that. We think we did pretty well.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.080]   Yeah, good job. So, I mean, as long as we're doing the family Hello,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.000]   family welcome. We should welcome all of her.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.560]   Brian back as in studio today from Boinks visiting us from Germany.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.720]   I'll go. Yeah, you should probably get him a chair and a microphone.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.360]   I'm sure he'll have tell you what if we say anything.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.760]   Upsetting jumped your leap to your feet and come run over here.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.280]   Also, a couple of people from Austria actually a family Adam and Julian and Ness visiting from
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.480]   Melbourne and that Ness is how old the eight months seven. All right.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.880]   But I think is a big Apple fan. So that's good news. He was just his idea to come here
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.480]   and Sheila and Kara and Carolyn Adam from Mission Viejo and San Luis Obispo. So we got a big family,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.840]   a big group in here. And guess what we're going to talk about? Not Apple.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.080]   Well, a little bit. We'll get to Apple, but I do have to say this.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.600]   So happy. This morning.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.360]   We're crowd pleasers. I know we really want to give you everything you want. But the rumor
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:44.040]   is of course that Apple is working on an echo killer, a Siri kind of a device.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.840]   And Business Insider says, and it could be expensive.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:55.560]   This is from Ming Chi Quo. It could be it's Apple. I don't know.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:02.200]   But I think the point is if Apple's doing that, they better darn hurry because Amazon is not
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.600]   resting on their laurels. This morning they announced a brand new Amazon Echo show.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.760]   Now you I pre-ordered a couple. And the reason you want a couple is because you can use it to
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.680]   make phone calls one to the other. So I got one from my mom. I'm going to send it to her for
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:26.040]   Mother's Day except it won't come out till June 28th. But the idea is this thing has a screen on
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.360]   it. And it does everything an echo does, but it also makes phone calls. And today later today,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.120]   I guess they will enable the Amazon Echo you already have to make audio phone calls.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.000]   Really interesting to watch Amazon slowly take for the world.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.920]   Well, it's it's a way of getting people now that there are this not the only game in town to
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.560]   make people think that why would I want my next device to be an Apple device? Why would I want
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:02.200]   it to be a Google device or now even a Microsoft device when G I know I this Alio
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.280]   shows my friend Alio has been serving me well for the past five or six, seven years.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   Why would I not get Alio shows even smarter cousin Alexei to into the house as well. And
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.280]   they're doing it with it's really quite savvy the way that they're doing this, I think.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:23.000]   It is cool the idea that I as soon as I got the brief on it, it kind of got me interested in not
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.640]   having this necessarily on my nice stand, but having it like on a corner of my desk because
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.840]   even now I still still do business phone maybe. Yeah. Well, not well, not only that, but I do use
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.920]   Alio show as my really as my my research assistant like I'll be sitting here in front of a with
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.960]   actual keyboard and a computer and I need to I'm reading something where that with this new devices
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.760]   almost 14 grams less less heavy and I'll just shout out Alio show what's 14 grams and ounces
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.800]   and just hear it back. And the idea of saying show me a picture of the latest whatever and that'll
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.920]   do but the really the really savvy thing with calls and video calls as does have a video camera is
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:06.520]   it really is a big deal to you have a lot of people in your life that you kind of need to look
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.440]   in on from time to time at certain age of life. It's going to be your infant kids in the in the
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.560]   other room, but it is sometimes going to be you have an elderly elderly relative who can live
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.800]   independently, but will benefit from occasionally if you've called this person twice in two days
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.240]   and you haven't gotten any answer. If this person has permitted you to simply say Alio show let me
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:37.000]   peek in on my aunt Gail and just see if things look okay in her apartment. So long as there's so
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.360]   long as it's secure so long as it's trusted as long as that camera isn't activated when you
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.440]   don't think it's going to be activated or by people that you're not going to allow to. That's a
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.040]   compelling reason for somebody to say you know what I think I do have an aunt Gail I do have an infant
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.080]   I think I would like to have one of these in my house and like what just like yourself I'd
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.960]   like to give one as a gift so I can just simply call out call this person and I'm some I'm
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.880]   something talking to him. So it's a really interesting application of the one extension.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.320]   The one thing that I didn't see was any kind of HDMI output and I don't know if it has video I
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.400]   think it has a three and a half millimeter output for audio. Yeah I think it's audio up but I don't
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.280]   think video. They're touting though as they did with the tube they're touting the speakers they say
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:26.920]   Dolby stereo speakers in here but yeah you're right there's no I don't even know if there's audio
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   I think the reason the reason for that I understand that it'll be all in one you want to keep it
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.560]   simple I think for me though being able to put it on a larger screen could be you know interesting
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:42.280]   and I would also like to point out there's an atom processor in here this is not the same echo
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.080]   that we've seen before this is something more significant incidentally it if you have a ring
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:54.760]   doorbell one of our sponsors you could say Alieosha like that Alieosha who's at the door and see that
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.840]   on the screen there are a lot of reasons to have a screen in this do you think this theory that
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.640]   apple would be doing would have a screen we've heard rumors and well in fact more than rumors
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:11.560]   Microsoft has mentioned that Cortana devices should have screens I think screens make a ton of sense
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:18.120]   because we have a Google home and honestly I don't end up using it for hardly anything because I can't
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:25.320]   you know what it gives me I have to then sit down sort of listen to and parse carefully whereas I
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.200]   read a whole lot faster than than anything can speak to me so if I can just glance at the screen
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   and say oh yeah that's what I need or not I think that makes a big difference and you know when the
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.880]   calls what I think is actually more important than anything else is that it's fixed like you can
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.200]   have this on your dining room table or something and you know where to go interesting you know so
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.760]   you like if you sit in this chair you'll be able to have a phone call with your with your mother
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.680]   or with your sister who has a new baby or something like that and so every time we've done FaceTime
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.880]   it's always a little awkward because you're like pulling out your phone you got a whole phone up
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.200]   you know and your computer is not really a setup to be multiple people in front of it that kind of
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.400]   thing so so I think having I think the the screen and sort of the fixed position is going to be what's
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.240]   make this kind of most interesting my one of the reasons I'm sending one to my mom is we face
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:21.880]   time every week but there's always that awkwardness where she says you turn to sideways or wait wait
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.080]   let me get my headphones and there's this is a whole bunch of stuff and you nailed it Adam is that
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.920]   it's it's you know it's in moving around and here's the other thing which I mean
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:37.960]   this is so frustrating but we don't say hello anymore when we start an internet phone call of
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:44.200]   some sort we say can you hear me yeah because it doesn't work half the time or there's a setting
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.320]   that's wrong or whatever so if this just works you know without having to know that you're plugged
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.960]   into the headphones without having to change your settings that's a big win that's actually back
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:01.160]   to the plain old telephone system which just worked it's it's you know you got to admire
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.840]   amazon's I mean the truth is this isn't really new hardware because if you had a fire tablet or
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.760]   even the app on your phone you could do a lot of these things there was you know when I was playing
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:18.440]   music on an echo for instance I could see it on my app you know what was playing and so forth and
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:24.520]   I understand that the calling that they've added today will also do video calling if you on your
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.000]   app so that you know they they're not really creating any new technologies just new a new piece
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.240]   of hardware to support this and it'll be it'll be interesting to see if they eventually grow to
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:38.760]   with with a better processor growing grow to multiple people on the same call so oh yeah I don't really
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.760]   see anything with the group calling yet but um they're taking a hundred bucks off if you buy two
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.840]   of them that clearly they they want this to be a point-to-point system by the way wouldn't be the
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.640]   first time we've seen this kind of point-to-point system eight by eight did that
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:56.120]   15 years ago and so I mentioned a three-come Audrey to the Audrey was the kitchen computer and
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   this looks a little bit like an Audrey and a lot of people comparing it to the chubby which was
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.920]   like a big chum bro this is a seven inch screen it's like a big chumby so this is not a product that
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.880]   has not failed in the past it's failed many times well you know google had a you know had one for
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.800]   their hangouts that was like kind of a setup for your tv that you know there was like a little bit of
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.600]   a box that you would connect to your tv to do this I think that was still more setup than most
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.160]   people wanted but having this be able to go back into some kind of web interface or be able to
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.800]   interact with and group calling and so on so forth what's great about that as you could have you
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:34.280]   know a couple different people able to jump in but you could still you know people who don't have
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.600]   one could could be part of it you know from their from their phones from you know you know this is
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.320]   just one input into that system I think that might be possible we'll see if they actually do that
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.640]   one thing that they are saying or they at least in their and their ad copy is you know they
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.960]   and we're part of the flash news briefing right now we send them audio only carsten get ready
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.720]   because it looks like they're gonna have video in the flash news briefing and that's one way that
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.480]   you might be watching this as a television which is kind of an interesting thing I think you're
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   right Andy I think this is on your office desk this is where you work it's it's it's a it really
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.480]   to show how Apple could take advantage of this I think that the reason why this has a lot more
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   chances of success than any of the other devices that we mentioned that tried to do this is that
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:21.400]   it it's not trying to create something brand new this it's not trying to displace oxygen from
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.880]   your existing home it's designed to here's a feature that you already use that you already
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.120]   like that you already trust here's another one of those that does all the things you like but we'll
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:37.160]   also do some other things as well so I'm I'm really keen to see how Apple would attack this
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.680]   problem because the the if they were to simply say that this is a conduit to all your content
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   by Apple music you've already got all your playlists and Apple music you've already got all your
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.800]   photos and Apple photos you've already got a lot of your documents in iCloud it has so you've
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.760]   already you've trusted so much of your information to Apple in a very secure way now here is a way
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.200]   that excuse me and you're also using I'm sorry you're also using messages you're also using the
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.440]   iMessage network now instead of having to convince your friend or your your your relative or your
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.680]   i get let's say that you're raising a child in a divorced family and that sort of situation
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.160]   here is a way you just buy this box and suddenly you can have a chat and simply say oh I went to
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.440]   by the way I went to Yosemite last week I really wanted to show you this weird bird that I said
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.240]   I came across and you just simply flick something from your iPhoto library and it'll come across
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:32.040]   it's not going to do well if they simply say here is we've solved the problem of talking to computers
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.920]   but the idea of saying that you you already use Siri you already use photos you already use
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.360]   messages you already use so many of our features now here it is in a box that will just simply
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:48.680]   take out those features and put this in a consumer device that is roughly affordable and so good that
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.520]   everybody in your closest circle will want to have one because it's just such a great way
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.840]   to communicate with each other that's a lot more natural than sitting in a you know in a computer
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.920]   studio with lights and a microphone and trusting that Skype or whatever is going to work so did they
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.880]   say anything about photoslide shows I didn't see that offhand in what I was reading but if you
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:15.160]   have photos on the screen yeah so so if this turns into you know the picture frame that's always on
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.360]   showing you your favorite pictures as well that's a win you know and you know we switch from that
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.600]   to having a phone call or displaying you know a recipe on screen that kind of thing
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:32.440]   a screen makes a ton of sense so WWDC less than a month away right
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:39.720]   no it's just exactly almost exactly a month away it's in June 15th right am I wrong actually it's
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:46.360]   in July I know by this year oh I I think so because I was wondering the same thing and yesterday morning
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:52.520]   I asked I asked my Google home what what are the dates of June 5th oh no I'm sorry no that was
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:58.040]   I'm sorry I was saying you have a comic on my oh easy I confuse the two I understand and yeah
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.160]   they're the two they're the two weeks where I am unavailable for other people and other people
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.720]   are unavailable to me so I need to know what those two weeks are so uh so uh you know I'm sorry
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.840]   less than a month apples gonna have its WWDC conference presumably this is
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:18.760]   I feel like it's a pressure cooker now for them that the pressure is building they've got this
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.960]   next generation iPhone Amazon which according Amazon isn't released figures but according to
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:30.360]   e-marketer has 70% of this whatever this market is this talking to a thing and having an answer
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.880]   market and Google has most of the rest of the Google home apples not on the map obviously nor
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:45.000]   as Microsoft but and but Apple has a history of you know not being the first to to out of the gate
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.120]   but often to beat everybody else with the best out of the gate is it too late for Apple what can I
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:55.800]   do it is a tough one because you've got an ecosystem a two-year-old ecosystem with the echo that's
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.720]   and not things that people are used to replacing right it's not like you buy a new one of these
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.280]   every year or two you're just like it's not it's not it's not a turnover I bought a Google home
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.960]   because I thought I should and I just don't use it because I have echoes everywhere which is funny
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.840]   because I have I have both and I use my kids have taken over to your home and don't talk to
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:20.440]   Amazon for whatever reason so they you know they like they just don't they for some reason it was
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.920]   wrong more often or something so is there room for Siri in your you know that I think so I think
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.320]   I think that the secret is actually the ecosystem not the ecosystem that Amazon and Google have made
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:34.200]   necessarily but the ecosystem that Apple has which is that if they connect something like this to
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.960]   your iPhones your iPads your your computers all the other things and make those all integrate with
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.560]   what that's doing I don't think that that's something that that you know Google and Amazon have as well
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.240]   established so for instance if they did something like what we're looking at here but I can call
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.520]   you on that from my iPhone and still you know so at your fix but I'm I'm not or I can call you
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.000]   call anybody's iPhone from from that and having that be you know taking advantage of FaceTime
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.160]   technology and so on so forth that ecosystem is something that is definitely to Apple's advantage
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:16.600]   it's a it's a challenge and it's not the only challenge Apple is about to face we'll talk more
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.880]   about that in just a little bit Andy Anacos here from the Chicago Sun Times Adam angst from
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.600]   tidbits Alex Lindsay from the pixel core I showed today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.440]   you buy in a house you're refying your existing home now's a good time to do that as interest rates

[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.800]   say that is in such a stark contrast to the the last time I bought a house three years ago
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:27.320]   we bought it from a bank you know the mortgage was from a big bank and it took more than a month
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.560]   and they kept coming back for more and more and more I wish rocket mortgage had been around
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.280]   then and I can tell you when it comes time to refire buy that's where we're going you do it all

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:28.680]   for their uh their support of mac break weekly it's funny because um I don't normally pay attention
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.800]   to apple patents but pat and the apple had an article saying apple was granted it's not like
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:40.760]   apples not doing rnd 41 patents today including an optical pen and an intelligent grocery store
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:48.520]   bag tag and now admittedly admittedly that you know apple with it with a you know full-time
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:55.640]   attorneys is going to patent everything they think of uh because you know why not but
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:01.480]   you got it kind of when when when i think come on apple can focus focus
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:08.280]   does the world need a bag tag i don't i they got a patent for their apple store bags for the
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:14.120]   handles on their apple store bags i mean there's such a machine there to do that that i know
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.360]   part of this is that you know someone comes up with something in in the midst of an idea of a
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.920]   larger ecosystem and they go okay well and i'm sure that there's a drive to to run those patents
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.320]   probably not super expensive scale that they didn't have anyone checked can you just can you do
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:34.920]   this with serie serie file a patent that would make it easy that would make it easy that's for sure
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.680]   um and again it keeps you other people out of that too so you know it's it's something that once
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.520]   they get ahead of that they are able to you know slow slow anything down that that might surprise
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.760]   them later you know you know you got some money they could they they could be working hard on
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.840]   something i hope they are uh besides the next iphone the next iphone's obvious and it's okay
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.920]   one of the problems uh company faces when you have such a big success with something is that it's
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:08.920]   hard to then you know uh go to the next thing well i i think that they have a lot of places they
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.080]   could go it's just a matter of deciding which one they want to and i think that they're i think
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.360]   that i personally think they're they may be waiting for you know some of the
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.000]   tax stuff to come through you know as far as let's talk about that because they uh we mentioned last
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.440]   week they have a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash 250 billion in cash most of it
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:37.080]   overseas uh and and you're right they're waiting for repatriation but it it's also
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.560]   important to point out that apple pays is the largest single taxpayer in the country 15.8 billion
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   dollars last year in taxes and and the uh and that's only accounting for apples uh their
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.240]   contributions but you know directly you know that's there i believe their sales tax and their
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:00.840]   corporate tax no no 15.8 billion on income taxes alone okay okay that's cool so then so then so
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.000]   then what you're not adding is the sales tax and the sales taxes is going to be bigger than that and
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.920]   then what you're not also adding is is how much tax their employees pay and then you're not all
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:15.000]   adding how much people are making you know the estimate i saw uh i can't find it but it was
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.280]   north of 20 billion dollars from employees and and contract people who who build into the you
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   know the contractors the the people who build into the app store within the united states
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.760]   all those things so you're talking you know 30 you know 30 35 billion dollars
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:36.040]   contributed by the company in one way or another yeah they apples tax rate despite the uh double
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:43.720]   irish with a Dutch sandwich uh is 25.8 percent now the statutory corporate tax rate is 35 percent so
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:51.160]   in effect what they're doing eliminates about 10 percent in tax by you know clever accounting on
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:58.680]   the other hand you look at microsoft which uh had 20 billion in foreign income in 2016 and their
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:08.520]   income tax expense was 3.3 billion they pay a mere 16.5 in taxes in google 19 percent so apple
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:15.080]   for all the criticism apple gets for hiding you know its revenues overseas they pay a very a
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.000]   much higher tax rate than either google or microsoft well i think part of that is that so much of
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.120]   their income is based on hardware yeah because i think that's hardware versus software is that
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:31.160]   okay although we said for so long it doesn't it seems foolish now you know i used to say
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.480]   whose wallet would you rather have steve jobs or build gates it always was build gates because
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.840]   you can make a lot more money on on an intangible good like software because you have to but there's
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.000]   no cost of goods or relatively little cost of goods but that's flip-flopped that flip-flopped
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.400]   years ago and of course for years microsoft's wished it were it had steve jobs and
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:57.640]   that were tim coz four you know general electric uh had a tax rate of minus 4.5 percent
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.680]   wait a second we're paying general electric to exist as taxpayers yeah i don't quite understand
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.360]   that uh yeah in effect they got a 400 million dollar tax benefit
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.800]   uh i don't even use g light bulbs so i don't know where that's coming from and i don't think that
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.120]   i and i i'm not i i believe and i'm not i'm not totally sure but i believe that what that
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.720]   benefit is is that gets carried over to the next year it's not something it's not like the
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.080]   government's writing them a check for foreign dollars i hope not they might have got a refund
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.320]   though uh i don't yeah i don't think i don't think that that was just joking yeah but but i think that
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.120]   i think that it's that that's that benefit of losses that were so great or something or so
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:37.000]   so many expenses are depreciated hardware area that that allowed exxon for instance oil
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.960]   oil companies have famous uh tax credits zero taxes in 2016
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:52.520]   although the company says in the decade they paid 110 billion over 10 years okay fine
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.880]   so uh you know i think i think one of the things this tells you is we got to reform the corporate
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:04.680]   tax system it's it's not it's clearly uh all over the place yeah well it's it that's the that's the
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.960]   problem that they build if you've got if you've got billions and billions of dollars to try to not
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.680]   pay taxes on that means that you've got tens and tens of millions of dollars to spend on accountants
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:20.440]   and lawyers to not not i'm not hide it for you but here's what the law is here is what you can do
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.960]   just like those are the people who are in the in the middle incomes we can afford to have
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   have accountants who say that okay yes actually if you take if you if you keep your receipts from
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.600]   the taxi fare you took from the airport to the conference hotel you can deduct that as an expense
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:44.280]   and six ways to sunday uh things that are legal but you might not occur to you that you can actually
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:50.120]   save some money on your taxes that way but it's it's a it's a really good it's it's a good number to
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.560]   have out there in public because it does give apple the credibility to fight for a different
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:02.680]   for repatriation of uh of overseas uh money that they've got it also gives them the credibility to say
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.960]   that perhaps we could be putting that money to better use domestically uh it's part of a lot of
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.920]   different information that is let's say it's coming out uh all of a sudden about here is what apple
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.240]   is doing with money and here is what apple is trying to incentivize for american manufacturing
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.840]   and creating american jobs again it's not necessarily being uh in a defensive position but it is a way
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:29.400]   to say it's easy for you to say here's how much we are the biggest taxpayer in the entire country
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.600]   we are not dodging taxes we are doing things that are completely legal however we would like to be
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:40.200]   doing things that are completely legal that also benefit the american economy better so that's it'll
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.480]   result in things that are to apple's advantage but it gives them the ability to not sound as though
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.600]   they're trying to cut medicare by half a trillion dollars in order to you know it's it gives them
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.240]   better footing it makes it makes a one i think i i personally think that the the corporate tax
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.480]   rate i mean when it's when it's as high as it is and it is the highest in the world uh you have to
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.440]   have loopholes because there are legitimate reasons that smaller companies can't operate at that you
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.320]   can't just say it's gonna be 35 percent and there's not any exceptions you know and so so the problem
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.880]   you get into is is that you have to create exceptions and those exceptions are the loopholes that
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:19.480]   everybody's using and so if by lowering that that tax and and then you know getting rid of some of
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.680]   those loopholes you could theoretically you know make that a lot simpler the the issue you know the
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:30.120]   thing that'll be really interesting to see what happens is this possible repatriation holiday
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:38.120]   that people are talking about which is you know a either a temporary or a a momentary you know dropped
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.400]   to 10 percent or something like that a repatriation of funds the estimates are there's a billion or
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.520]   trillion and a half dollars that are that's overseas that could come back in that's apples is a big chunk
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.480]   of that but there's a lot more that's out there that could come back in and then you end up with
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.680]   it is you know that money can now be reinvested in a lot of ways that money sitting all somewhere
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:04.200]   else in a bank or in bonds is constraining the growth of the united states well hold on there mr
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.560]   not going to come back i know that's what apple would like you to believe that's why they announced a
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.040]   billion dollar job creation fund they created a page that shows they have 2.2 million people in the
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.600]   u.s. employed there's a big pr campaign going on right now from apple to show it a good corporate
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.440]   citizen it is and a lot of that is aimed towards getting that money back in the country but i think
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:28.920]   i had forgotten but i was reminded that this has been tried once before 2004 george bush had a
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:34.760]   situation had a tax holiday and according to the wall street journal it was a failed policy it
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.960]   cost the treasury three point three billion dollars and lost revenue over ten years and it ended up
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:49.400]   really uh just the 15 companies are repatriated the most cut jobs 20,000 jobs between the year they
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.600]   got the money and three years later decreased the pace of their spending on research and development
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   you know what they did they bought exactly what apple will do they bought backstop
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:06.920]   paid off debt and paid their ceos more money so before we get all excited about the benefits of
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.600]   repatriation sure apple would like its quarter of a trillion dollars in its pocket but what will
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.320]   it do with it is another question i think this is part of a pr campaign apples that won't let you
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.560]   show it oh no we'll take that money and we'll do something highly highly likely they're going
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.840]   to pay off their debt because they've been borrowing to because they can't get at this money they've
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.960]   been borrowing to use it in the united states for stock buybacks and this billion dollars by the way
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.120]   is borrowed money it's not because but they get at a very low rate because everybody knows they get
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.440]   money in the bank i was going to say i mean i have to assume that apple's borrowing money because
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:47.080]   they're the the rate they get sensed to do that yeah so you know because why why why bother if you
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.920]   can get five percent of the you know the bank so to speak or your i mean i i was a
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.200]   bond because they can't touch their cash pile apple according to bloomberg buys more company debt
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:04.120]   than the world's biggest bond funds they have they they are big uh... lender of you know they
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.960]   they their apples corporate debt app strips the you know vanguard
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:13.800]   net west pimpco their corporate debt is uh a hundred forty eight billion dollars
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.280]   but they have two hundred fifty billion in the bank so but they just can't use it
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.480]   well i mean and again they're and thereby i mean the math is super simple i mean it's 35
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.160]   right by five percent to bring it into the country or three percent to pay against the
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.600]   best right exactly it doesn't that that that like no and it's easy to say that you know that
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.480]   apple should be doing it but if we had that money we would do the same thing sure we're not
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.760]   gonna get more money and that's the thing to point out they're not being they're not they're
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:44.200]   just doing what their fiduciary responsibility is which is minimize not only have to maximize
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.840]   doing what if about every corporation would do it so if it had the ability to do it right
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.080]   i do it so here's the question they've got all this money overseas and one of the things they
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.360]   could do with that money is they could start spending it overseas they do spend it and no
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.120]   gravity but he i mean that's the whole point is if they more if they more they spend overseas the
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.920]   less they're gonna be spending here and you can start seeing more and more you know kind of
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.480]   investment in other countries if it if it's one of those things where they just can't do anything
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.280]   else with the money they're just forced to sit on it they're they're gonna start using it in ways
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.840]   that you know might not be as advantageous to the u.s. well you know who's not getting that money
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:29.400]   quarkom oh it's this a messy fight apple says we're not going to pay the royalties we owe quarkom
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:35.560]   because they're suing quarkom and quarkom suing them apple says quarkom owes it a billion
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:42.840]   dollars in rebates uh quarkom is you know taking a pretty big hit from revenue not it's not getting
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:50.200]   from apple i don't i don't you know this is all about an ongoing court battle over the patents
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.680]   that should be apple thinks uh licensed at a much lower cost um tim cook has a uh a whole
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.480]   statement on why we're withholding royalties owed to quarkom owed to quarkom i invite you to read
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:10.040]   that in your own time uh because there's nothing more boring than a quark case people suing other
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:17.400]   people well but it's it could be it could get real interesting real quick if because it's it's like
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.880]   there is now a grenade inside every single iphone that apple has yet to sow that if they get if they
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.880]   get a judge on a very very bad day when he or she has not had their morning cookie and they simply
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:35.640]   say well you know what by a direct reading of the law the apple owes this company money is not
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.560]   paying this company money therefore they do not have the right to use this critical piece of software
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.720]   that is they plan to put inside every phone so guess what apple you cannot sell any iPhones that
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:50.200]   have the software and by the way that's exactly quarkom strategy right exactly that they they'll
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.320]   they can they could force apple in a position where they will have to say do we jeopardize the next
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:02.440]   launch or do we uh or do we simply do something we don't want to do which is to pay money that we
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.000]   legitimately don't feel that we owe so like this could get really really interesting really really
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.880]   quickly i don't think it'll go that far because i don't think that quarkom wants to lose a taste
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.920]   of every single iphone that gets sold i don't think that apple wants to let any full let any phone
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   release get delayed by eight seconds if they can avoid it but you better believe that uh apple has
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.480]   in his plans let's make sure we don't have to use any quarkom software let's find it let's find a way
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.960]   we can beat these patents let's find a way we can find an alternative technology or get this money
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.560]   back from overseas and buy the right company or buy quarkom if we have to in order to get out from
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.800]   under their thumb that that's really the big deal about repatriating this money you think about it's
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:48.040]   not apple is in a company that uh writes out big dividend checks to either its executives or its
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.160]   shareholders you got to think about this quarter of a trillion dollars as fire power this is the
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:41:00.200]   ability to keep the guns firing against google against amazon against microsoft by acquiring companies
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.960]   by developing entirely new technologies by taking a lot of services like manufacturing and all
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.360]   these technologies they have to license out and and and pay for and making it something that apple
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.400]   simply owns and can do on their own they do not have access to that weaponry so long as that money
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.760]   has to sit parked looking beautiful and all quarter of a trillion dollars like glistening on a hill
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:26.280]   that they can't reach it's by the way it's not a court is the itc the international trade commission
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.720]   uh a quasi judicial agency according to bloomberg that in washington has the power to block the
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.280]   import of guizant of the u.s and works more quickly than the federal district courts and that's
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:42.920]   caused concern now this is a article from may third saying quarkom is preparing to ask the itc
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:48.120]   as to my knowledge they have not yet done that so i'm not sure if this is mostly just a saber
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:53.640]   rattling or if they really do plan to do that but that would be i think quarkom has taken a five
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.440]   hundred million dollar right off in the in the order for saying that this is you know apple not
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.000]   paying us license fees is going to cost us half a billion dollars it's a big deal but also but also
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.440]   points of why a lot a lot of the work that uh that apple is doing in making sure they have good
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.480]   contacts and good relationships with washington d_c now you get to see why that's always such a
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.960]   smart investment because you never know who you're gonna have to call and say that look we would
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:23.880]   we don't do anything that will get you into into a congressional hearing or anything but
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.560]   we would like very much for our side to be heard and and validated here especially when you have
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:36.600]   any any legal any tribunal that is known as quasi legal that's a big problem whether you're
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.680]   the little guy or the big guy with his quasi legal there could be quasi justice
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.920]   speaking of quasi quasi numbers the two million dollar jobs that apple claims to
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:53.960]   created across uh 50 states well there's only 80 000 apple employees uh 450 000 jobs they say
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   are us based suppliers and a whopping three quarters of that more than three quarters of that is
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:08.120]   attributable to the app store ecosystem so i'm hey that two million a little bit of a soft number there
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:14.600]   but this is all part of that law i mean this is a this page this apple page it's at apple.com
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:21.560]   apple.com/jobcreation yeah is really lobbying is that kind of it's exactly what you were saying
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   Andy this is not aimed at you and me this is aimed at washington d_c but well that too but also to
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:34.680]   make sure that the the apple tribe is on apple side just just just think about that for a second that
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.680]   my uh when the when my uh iphone suddenly can't hold a charge for more than two hours and i go to
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:46.280]   apple.com just to find out when i can get a time at my local genius bar that's the first thing that
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:51.320]   i get to see or that's that's one of the things i can see which apples message on how how good apple
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.120]   is for the united states and how gosh that could be my cousin who gets that job work on a local
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.640]   many fact really come on apple and then they break it down state by state in alaska there's one store
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:08.920]   74 employees but a thousand app store jobs so you see that's that's yeah that's that's the music
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.640]   long quarters they got nothing to do but develop i am working hard that's that's good that's good
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.880]   you know alaska is a pretty good place to develop i mean no no but i but okay there's a thousand
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:23.080]   jobs but are they paying jobs i mean right that's that's all right i know people on both
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.520]   spectrums of the app store people who are not making any money they put something out it didn't work
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.320]   out and people who have made millions on it so this is definitely a wide range absolutely but i
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   would say that if you're saying three quarters of the two million jobs you've created in the u.s. or
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.720]   people writing apps that's not right that's like five million people making money right i forget i
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.200]   forget what what company was but it was a large company that's going into like home delivery of
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.240]   food whatever that was sent me press release and this is going to create over 10 000 delivery
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:56.360]   jobs in the united states and i'm you know you you have to sigh a little bit and say
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.520]   yeah you're going to be giving health care and dental you're going to be paying them all a living
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:07.000]   wage with time off no you're just going to be you just want meat drones until you can replace
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.480]   them with actual drones and pay them nothing at all so don't don't come to me about how you're
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.280]   creating jobs unless you're willing to tell me how you're going to help this employee to feed their
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:21.640]   children and maybe have some money to retire on even if it's not enough to retire on completely
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:27.800]   andy look at all the blue dots i mean the blue dots speak look these are all these are even even
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.960]   better those that's not just blue dots my friend those are those are aqua marine dots
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:39.640]   okay yeah and i i don't want to do it so you talk you talk about the politics i have no doubt
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.720]   that there were a lot of meetings about what color they're going to choose for their jobs it cannot
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:49.320]   be too blue cannot be too red it has to look like it's politically indifferent yeah
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:56.200]   uh all right we i don't this is not the apple bashing show i don't want to make it the apple
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.760]   bashing show but uh just you know i'm i will i will i will take i want to take a second though
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.160]   because that is a complaint and you're and people do you're you're entitled to feel how you want to
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.920]   feel but at least i can only speak for myself that my point of view is that apple lives in a world
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.960]   that it's going to have to deal with and if there is a product made by microsoft or by amazon or
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:21.160]   political thing that is going that is going to affect apple or it's interesting to discuss how
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.000]   it could affect apple we need to discuss it and talk about how it's going to affect apple
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.400]   i just i will defend it feel feel feel how you want to feel but that's the it's not
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.760]   be if we talk about these things not because we're not interested in apple it's because
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.800]   we are interested in apple we're not just only interested in again oh my god the champ for
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:43.240]   angle on that casing i have to change my pants twice today i'm so excited about this champ for
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.800]   angle there's a limited number of champ for angles we can discuss actually let me ask you adam you've
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.920]   been doing this for 27 years and uh if you cover one company of course there's an ebb and flow
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:59.160]   to the stories this is going to be right now as we lead up to wwdc there's not going to be any
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:07.400]   news it's all going to be rumors so what do you do i have to admit after 27 years i ignore them
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   i i you know i really want to ignore rumors i just think they're stupid
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:18.840]   but but we do it just because we got to talk about something well and and it we've actually
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.520]   were joking internally that we want to have the article about all the news we didn't cover
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:29.800]   yeah because it's not news right because it's not i mean you know there's a there's only so much
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:36.360]   you can do or so much you can write about stuff that isn't yet it's not real yeah it's not real
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:42.520]   and you can speculate all day long or you can just ignore it put it out of your head wait till
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:49.320]   something happens and then analyze what actually happened because i mean i i still remember way back
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:55.160]   when i started writing books um this is in the you know 1993ish 1940s it was just on the edge of
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:01.640]   when the magazines would cover books and we're talking to the editor i think it was mac week
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:08.200]   actually um and and they were they were saying that you know they really had to be careful about
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.360]   what they covered because people they wanted to cover stuff that people have made just buying
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:19.000]   decisions about and books weren't expensive enough so so i've always learned that about you know like
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.200]   when i'm talking about rumors or whatnot does this help someone make a buying decision yeah no i
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:30.520]   know it's more just it is the answer is no if it's just so proper it's so proper then i got better
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.080]   things to do with my time although a whole lot less than i you did a couple weeks ago there are a
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:41.800]   lot of there are a lot of uh the most dopey rumor story is when we announce that apple cancels
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.960]   a product it never announced those are my favorites and we still do those two you know apple's not
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.320]   gonna do a self-driving car even though they never announced they were unless they are two weeks
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.360]   they are and then we hope they are because it'll give us something to talk about i don't know i like
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.920]   speculate and you know we're doing we have to fill two hours a week you don't have to do it
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.400]   it's actually that's i mean that's the thing is is it if it's if it's if you're doing it for fun
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:14.200]   yeah um that's one thing if you're pretending that it makes a difference to someone's life as to
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:19.160]   whether or not apple's gonna do a self-driving car right now it doesn't it just doesn't well here's
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:25.400]   the good news there is no rumor news this week it's like nothing thanks a lot alex for making me
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:31.480]   feel really good about my life choices in my career right now in the end what does anything
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:37.240]   that any of us do in the long run it we're food for worms whether we write about this or don't write
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:44.760]   about this all right i'm going i i there's a piece of cake in the fridge and i'm just gonna
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   go get it there's some there is some hard news there's a pro a mac trojan floating around we'll

[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:12.840]   to do your job zip recruiter.com/twit if you downloaded hand break which we tell everybody to
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:20.520]   download it's one of the greatest tools ever but if you downloaded it from the dates of may second
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:28.520]   through may sixth inclusive you have a 50/50 chance you got a trojan because one of the two mirrors
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:37.480]   was compromised and you were downloading an infected application it's a variant of a
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:44.360]   of a trojan has been around for a while OS 10 dot proton zip zip recruiter hand break
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:51.320]   has a security warning on their site with the terminal commands complicated though they might
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:58.920]   be that will remove that and apple the good news is if you didn't you know download it and install
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:05.320]   it at that time you're okay now because OS 10's x protect has already been updated to block it
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:12.440]   so you don't have to worry about it i was it did they have a we've seen this before a
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:18.840]   forged certificate or maybe hand break doesn't maybe hand breaks maybe one of those apps we don't
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.640]   break is not signed it's not signed that's why and why not i mean that's you know it's one thing if
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.720]   you're just you know doing some kind of little one-off open source thing and you don't you know a
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.960]   group zero point three or something but hand breaks been around forever and it's used by a ton of
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.880]   people why aren't they you know signing with a developer certificate that would have stopped
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:40.680]   this as far as i understand how much does it cost to get an app signed by 99 bucks so if you're a
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:46.360]   developer you get a suit your developer yeah so that's what i don't know reason not to spend 99 bucks
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:55.560]   even if your french school boys get it yeah but i having said that Adam there have been
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:01.720]   cases of for certificates in fact my very recently couple weeks ago yeah it's not a guarantee but
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.640]   it makes it a little harder it makes it a little harder it raises the bar yeah i mean they're already
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.800]   doing things with signing and publishing their signing keys and whatnot so you can compare them
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:14.760]   manually but who's going to do that yeah i know that that's the open source way of doing things you
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.760]   know you have a hash and you publish it and you say now you got to run your pgp against
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.520]   the downloaded file make sure the hash matches and yeah who's going to
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:29.080]   apparently very few people are going to do that apple if you do get a cert though it gives apple
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:34.040]   yet another tool to block it so they use uh x protect but they also can revoke the certificate
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:40.520]   in fact that's what happened uh with the uh os 10 doc malware do we talk about i think we talked
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:46.760]   about doc last week that's the one that comes as an attachment document with a k.zip if you open it
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:53.400]   uh it can install trojan on your system and that had a valid certificate but forged and apple of
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.520]   course immediately revoked it and now it won't run now it won't install unless you've got your
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:04.760]   gatekeeper set to ignore all that which you shouldn't really shouldn't do it's no problem the right
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.600]   click if you got something without a certificate like hand break you right click on it you say open
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:12.840]   and then you get infected it's much easier yeah that's that's the problem of this kind of security
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.560]   where you at some point it gets you i know that i've just i've just downloaded something from a
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.200]   third party i've never had a problem with this so i don't even really register that to click through
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.840]   anything to get there even though i should probably it's a reminder that you should probably at least
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:31.000]   ask yourself are you getting it directly from the source are you getting it from a mirror are you
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.640]   getting it from a place like one of the third party download sites where they could have added pretty
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:41.480]   much anything to it so to be i don't know who is here it does not all
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:47.080]   gatekeeper and sierra what does not allow you to do your choices are app store and app store and
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:52.760]   identify developers you can't turn it off entirely without doing extra work actually somebody in
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.480]   chamois making an interesting point which is that hand break is often used oh is that all over
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:03.480]   what can we get a let's get on what can we get do we have a room from all over i know it's a big
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:11.080]   panel but let's get his thoughts on this he's a developer blanks software b o i n x software
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:18.120]   and you get a certificate right all of her for all of your stuff yeah but you're a big shot you're
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.600]   big time he points out you've got he's got not he's got any way we could have him join the panel
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.760]   do you want to do that let's do it
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:32.440]   john's gonna watch this is our crack engineering team leaps into action look at this look at this
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.880]   adam you're gonna have to move over though a little bit we'll just yeah
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:41.720]   have a sliding over to the right of the screen just one more way here for all of us kind of high
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:48.760]   you will have something to say about all of this um we're just going to drop this in i should have
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:55.160]   i should have done this sooner i apologize for uh i'm doing it now as long as we're doing this let
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.600]   me mention a rumor that adam angst would prefer i don't say anything about this is a correction to
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.640]   the rumor that was wrong that apple wouldn't ship its iphones to maybe next year they know they
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:11.400]   knew all that iphone till next year apple reportedly set to start shipping the iphone in october
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:17.960]   just this is one of those rumors it corrects a rumor that apple never said anything about
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.680]   it's the completely all rumor it's rumors all the way down
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:26.280]   yeah it's gonna say until it's turtles till it's turtle it's crazy it's crazy
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:33.160]   chikwoa is fighting with some other analyst over this i guess uh we'll find out hey oliver it's nice
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:38.680]   to see you yeah oliver has uh been on the show many times before comes out uh you're in we're in
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:44.280]   germany are you uh munik munik oh that's the place to be you're in the world yes you're in the world
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.600]   i'm gonna come visit you in september for october fest you work on which is confusing but that's how
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:55.800]   it works uh i'll visit you in september for october like well you know how i know that i came in october
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:02.760]   that beer was gone yeah you guys drank it all yeah yeah so um you boinks get certificates
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:08.520]   yeah of course of course uh ninety nine bucks is that all i mean just to be a developer yeah it's
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:14.360]   a yes that's there's no other process no other yeah i mean it's it's it's a pain in the ass to actually
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:23.400]   sign all the apps and that this is the certificates and uh the signatures and and that's all my
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:31.640]   engineers after like hate you doing this for like five six seven eight years uh they still struggle
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:40.200]   with figuring it out apple has made it much easier and recent um in the recent uh years uh with the
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:47.880]   with the latest uh releases um so xx code now has the option to say you know just fix this for me
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:53.160]   but my engineers are like don't press that button don't press that button it's you know it's doing
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   things and we don't understand it and afterwards you have to start over all over again so they can be
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:05.080]   they they uh there's room for improvement there but uh i think i don't have to stop handbrake from
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:12.520]   doing it i know they do it well i think maybe maybe they um maybe they have their other
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:19.240]   up you know other priorities or maybe uh it's a way to stop them from actually distributing
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.320]   so that might be the concern because they are used to rip dvd's they they they took that
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:30.680]   capability they took d css out of it and said no you're gonna have to go get vlc if you want to do
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.440]   that yeah yeah another unsigned app um but i think you're right apple might very well under pressure
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.320]   from hollywood say well we're not gonna allow either vlc or handbrake to exist so that might be a
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:46.920]   yeah possibility yeah yeah and uh so you run a little bit of a risk if you're doing that but um
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:54.280]   but fortunately apple has x protect which is i think i they deserve more credit for that that's
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.680]   not something they talk about but they deserve more credit for that because that is a very useful
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.880]   tool in blocking malware infections once they're discovered and it's one of the reasons that the
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:10.440]   platform is safer so as long as i got you how's how things going uh i stop motion we've used for
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:16.520]   years photomajico anything new coming from uh well we we're gonna have now yeah well
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:23.880]   uh we we're currently focusing on the nimo life which is uh live video streaming live video production
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.440]   app um yeah is that for facebook live or that's also for facebook live we can do live streaming for
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:39.480]   all platforms facebook uh youtube twitch um you name it we can do it pascal yeah that's pretty cool i
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.720]   might have to use it right now i do facebook live right into the facebook client uh huh doesn't
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.960]   give you a whole lot of capability no yeah so i could go through this mimo live yeah mimo live is
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.560]   a live video production system and as you're switching the screen screening graphics we can
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:02.440]   even do like the panel discussions we now have a thing called mimo call uh where people can join
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:10.920]   your show just by clicking on a URL that you sent to them uh in uh a chrome browser so uh it's sort
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:16.200]   of like a web rtc yes yes based on webbout to see so we uh last time i saw you was at any
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.520]   be a year ago and uh the mivo came out from live stream and i used that a couple of times to stream
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:29.720]   live can i use the mivo live uh mimo live not their separate they're separate tools yeah they uh they
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:36.280]   every all of this and you discussed this earlier all of these companies are trying to build their
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:43.320]   own ecosystems and they they don't want to let you in there easily so it's always a fight and uh
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:50.200]   with us being based in in europe uh it's even harder to uh to get someone to talk to us there
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.400]   try this looks cool yeah it's very cool every time you know as as the world advances alex
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:02.520]   and and i see all these inexpensive solutions and i look at how much it cost us to build this studio
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:09.960]   yes and you the good thing about alex is he's always trying everything but uh did you try mimo
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:21.080]   live yet your mics muted sir alex is mike oh sorry um i i tried it when it first came out and there
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.440]   were a couple things missing i haven't looked at the latest version and i need to jump into what
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.120]   i was looking at the call and especially the web rtc calling would be really interesting
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:34.680]   how many people can you call it one time uh that's not limited um uh i mean it's limited by the
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.960]   bandwidth and and uh the processing power of your computer but uh there's no hard limit like
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.920]   coded into the software we've done six seven and and you can and just each one of them just
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   comes in as an input yes like like they like they are their own uh camera and microphone it's like
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:56.840]   skyposaurus the big thing that we built many years ago yeah like that just easier
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:05.960]   and and we can also do a hi-fi sound so uh we've got uh we've got this guy the one guy who runs a
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:16.040]   guitar show and he has this uh uh his his uh users or viewers call in and play them guitar riffs and
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.320]   that's cool over the end as far as your inputs it's just it's just limited to the sdi card so
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   eight inputs or sixteen inputs if it if it had them uh so we can do eight inputs with the black
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:35.240]   magic um card with the quad two uh i don't think we can get more than eight inputs just because
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.760]   the machines currently don't handle more uh bandwidth it's a lot we've been using a tricaster
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.640]   with eight inputs for years without any you just have to you know you have a switch away to switch
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.480]   your video inputs on the fly well the the thing is we we like to do the switching inside
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:57.160]   meanwhile because then we do like you can do an ops and yeah yeah we do that with a tricaster i'm
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:02.680]   just saying because that was actually the biggest expense in this studio was having a uh a patch
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:11.080]   bay in effect that uh brought black magic uh what is it called 288 by dale powder yeah it's 144 in
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:17.720]   288 out and uh that was expensive but that that means that we in effect have 144 inputs we just
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.880]   have to pick the eight we're going to use today not recommending that by the way if you're
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.880]   that's it's the things like that that really make it all start to add up but we had at one time i
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:33.320]   i think 40 different cameras plus lots of other inputs of all kinds of computers you know this is
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:40.680]   an input everything i you know we do is an input here uh but this is good i in a really i like to see
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:45.560]   it that become more and more affordable and available uh to anybody who wants to do this i think that's
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.760]   fantastic it's nice to see all of you yeah just thanks for coming being here yeah yeah next time
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:55.240]   please some brought worst and beer please bring them bring them right here yeah all of us taking
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:01.720]   uh let's uh let's see what are we going to do here uh i want to do a couple more stories and then
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:08.520]   we'll take a break and get your picks of the week okay um apple actually i'll stick around it because
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.400]   there's some app stuff that maybe uh you might want to uh weigh in on all of her for instance
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.640]   apples updating its analytics service new metrics showing how apps get discovered
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:23.480]   you're a mobile app developer yeah we are yeah does apple give you as much help as you'd like and
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:29.000]   in things like this uh so i think the best improvement that they made this year was that you can now
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:37.400]   actually uh respond to uh reviews things and reviews uh that's that's that's a huge thing yes and that's
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.000]   you got by the way that's not just good for developers that's good for end users too because the reviews
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.920]   really were becoming just a mess and people were you know trashing you and you had no way of saying
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.960]   no that's not true uh or that guy that's the competitor or whatever and i think it's not it's
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.000]   really helpful for people reading reviews to hear the uh it androids had this for a long time and i
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.600]   always read the response from the developer and often that reassures me oh the developer knows about
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.560]   this bug cares it's not a bug it's somebody who's not half the time reviews are people who just
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:14.200]   couldn't or just yeah just uh just uh text-support questions basically you know yeah uh so the analytics
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.400]   now uh apple's been doing that for a couple of years but you can actually now see for instance
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.000]   how people you know found you you can see app whether they found you through browsing the app store
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.280]   searching the app store through a refer in the app store or refer in the web although interestingly
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:38.520]   at the same time as they've done this they cut the web refer fee to to what was it to it from seven
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:45.080]   to two percent um but this is uh what when you look at this kind of stuff where do where do your
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:51.560]   where do your customers come from it must be from web referrals right uh we we sent most of the
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:57.800]   customers uh from our website to uh to the app store um so so one interesting thing about these
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:02.680]   things is that are the other available for all our Mac and iOS apps or is it just iOS apps?
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   iOS all right so so that's that's kind of a cool a puzzling thing for me is that how many of these
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.440]   features are just available for iOS and I don't have an app store other than that I don't understand
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:20.520]   what I think it should be the same software driving both app stores but apparently there must be some
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:29.640]   sort of difference between those so yeah uh and in in fact in this article uh in tech crunch
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.440]   Sarah Perez writes uh at the very it's possible as well apples rolling out these metrics ahead of
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.960]   an app store makeover at WWDC that could change how discovery works and they wanted to get this
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.720]   into developers hands in advance of that so another thing one of many things to be watching for at
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:52.360]   WWDC you're not going to WWDC this year why not um it's the timing didn't work out and also you know
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:09:02.520]   that you'd like to um yeah obviously yes uh but uh it's also a hard case to make for a business wise
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.280]   for the expenses right now yeah I think it's good that they move back to San Jose I don't know maybe
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:15.080]   is that because the Moscone Center is like something there I think they're slowly they said it's
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.880]   because Apple staff spent so much time on the road to San Francisco they would lose hours of
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.680]   productivity but obviously this is the last one that's not going to be on the Apple campus I would
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.040]   think that they'll be doing these maybe not Google's doing it's it's uh it's developers conference next
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.360]   door to Google and then people come over to Google for the the rest of this stuff the keynote is
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:43.240]   it sure that Apple but I think Apple's new theater is not big enough they also need to
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:51.720]   at the uh you know on campus is it I'm afraid of spies well it's it's it's an uncomfortable
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.440]   situation they don't want to have like thousands of people that are by nature going to like pair
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.840]   off into little groups and try to find a place where they can have a private conversation and
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.440]   find out that they're in a room with lots of really fancy tables that are covered with blue
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:10.520]   sheets you know yeah you want to see you want to see how the uh Apple Park is progressing I think
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:17.640]   that San Jose is making a a pretty hard push we've seen Google go south Facebook go south Apple go
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.840]   south so I think that you know they're making it advantageous for them to to do that people want
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.280]   to come to San Francisco because San Jose's kind of dead but if this is where the mothership is you
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.880]   might as well you might as well come down here so now the building is pretty much done I understand
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.760]   they told us people be moving in this month right uh in fact I thought they were going to move in
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:45.160]   in April April the rumors told us yeah the rumors rumor mill said but there's still as you can see
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.480]   there's a lot of landscaping going on and there's still a big pile of pile-o dirt
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:55.880]   look at those trees though we definitely looks very juts in though when you even when you look at the
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.520]   the entrances to the underground parking and everything else yeah does feel like it's going to be
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.160]   look how mature these trees are and they're all in containers we talked about this a couple of
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.240]   weeks ago that the people who buy trees for parks have ever pissed at Apple because they're buying
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:15.320]   up all the mature trees in the world there's how many of them are apple trees yeah they're all
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.800]   none of them they look like they're all evergreen there you know what they are they're uh native apple
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   truth now that you think about it i mean it seems like good they're great incredible this area all
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:31.640]   was plum trees this is uh San Jose was the prune yard oh thank god i'm looking i'm looking i'm looking
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.840]   at the theater roof i'm thinking that that that little like a lighter colored like dot at the top
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:42.520]   that should totally be an apple logo like at the back of the back of that oh why isn't it a glowing
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:48.040]   apple logo i can't i can't look at that and not think oh that's what we should totally have done
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.960]   but then turn it on especially who don't look they've already got traffic like
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:59.080]   bop there's traffic already coming in uh these guys are so used to drones flying over they don't
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.520]   even look up anymore so i think that cherry pick that cherry picker must be like doing a tracking
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:10.760]   shot of that guy who's walking maybe it is maybe it's a they're making the video the making of
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:19.160]   apple park this is the i think that's the rnd uh building which is separate and uh you know
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:25.560]   obviously very secure so that johnny i've and company can invent the next apple apple product
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.680]   privacy and security i think the whole thing should actually have that floating sign on top
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.520]   that they had put on the the title at the very beginning there they're just like covering an
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:39.160]   air before the whole thing yeah how do we know what this is it's just a circle when we fly over
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.040]   yeah i understand as a if if it had to you know that giant glowing sign they'll be they'll be
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.760]   got they'll be some signage come on there's gonna be something what's this big gray dot in the middle
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.840]   there's gonna be there's there's gonna be some sign come on we know that's where the missile errors
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.680]   uh that's right that's the missile silo opening the helicopter pad yeah for people listening at
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.400]   home where you know there's you're not missing anything you walk home is gonna gonna gonna
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.320]   give you the answer will be you we have our fingers on the trigger
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:15.160]   we will launch if you do not pull down your your lawsuit it's very evil genius uh looking i must say
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.720]   yeah there's a gym there's a big gym lots of room for geeks to work out
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:29.560]   there you go apple park getting getting closer i think i think i'm i'm thinking now the next
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:36.280]   iPhone announcement will be in this big new theater what do you think i hope so i would think so yeah
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:42.120]   and uh i'm gonna lobby like i said i'm lobbying i think i'd be surprised if there were if in the next
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:49.160]   month or two there wasn't a one or two or three very trusted journalists or outlets were not
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.280]   allowed to have the exclusive tour or maybe they're holding that for 60 minutes or you know for sure
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:14:00.920]   that's charlie rose in 60 minutes for sure for sure i do think that i my guess is the iPhone the
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.600]   new iPhone announcement whenever that occurs will most likely happen in that theater i think that
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:10.200]   the timing of exactly when they move in is probably still flexible yeah perfect yeah uh by the way
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.560]   thanks to duncan sinfeld who's one of the two uh drone pilots who has been providing a video
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.400]   footage of the apple new apple campus and that video we ran was dunkins uh video
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:31.080]   uh let's see what else tim cook and jeff williams named times list of the 20 most influential
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:37.960]   people in tech right now jeff is the c-o-o at apple tim i think has an important job there
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:48.200]   bah tim finished behind uh elan musk jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg but he was on the list he was
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:55.080]   number four these lists are dumb these are as bad as rumors don't you think i think they should do
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.800]   instant run off voting for those kinds of things so you know you could really you could rank them in
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:05.240]   order and i mean who's how do they say yeah yeah that's to enlist the most information
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.720]   uh influential people on mac break there you go there we're the ones on that list
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:17.160]   from but we're also we're also four we're also five people who don't wear ties apparently yeah
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:22.360]   well if you want to be very just if i were like the ceo of a company that big and my
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.520]   official photo like my mom would call me the next day saying why weren't you wearing a tie
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.680]   when you killed people put on a tie it was a big important photo you should have been wearing a tie
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.880]   this is interesting because well i jit pie this chairman of cc was number 11 is wearing a tie
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:43.720]   but i think he's the only person uh wearing a tie in all of these 20 people including tim
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   and of course zuckerberg's wearing a t-shirt bazos is wearing a casual jacket and open neck
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.600]   no time is this the end of the neck tie is this silicon valley telling us it's
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:18.760]   karsten you're a bow tie wearer you don't get to vote karsten g
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.800]   it does feel kind of dressy it's kind of cool but i look at it and like this is the most absurd
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.520]   thing that i've ever figured it is absurd that i have a piece of cloth just hanging here for no
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.240]   reason like there is nothing there i'm not going to dab my face with it i'm gonna spend the entire
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.240]   day making sure it doesn't get caught into something or doesn't get you know like it's because usually
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.000]   i'm wearing them because i'm working and uh it's always like it's going to get caught on a case or
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.960]   something so uh they've done this before and according here's another rumor sorry adam
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:53.480]   according to nine to five mac apple is going to do another one of those overnight refreshes
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:17:00.360]   on may 16th of older apple stores they do these they come in and they just overnight
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.560]   they revamp the whole store they did it in uh 2015 right what are you laughing at
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:13.240]   i'm sorry but i'm going on ebay right now i've got there's some chinese distributor that can
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.760]   sell me like four dozen like comical rubber noses and i just want to buy a bag of those
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.320]   and like pre-glue them and then just sneak into a store on a busy day and just like stick noses on
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:30.120]   those those bowling ball sized like wooden things that they put those on the maple you're just begging
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:36.360]   for like a groucho glasses on those things yeah yeah they do they like please make fun of us for
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.160]   the having these things that's what they're saying if you're going to bring go take the trouble
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.840]   bringing rubber noses bring some googly eyes while you're at it why don't they have noses and googly
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:51.800]   eyes yes it looks it looks a lot like the company store they they did a big remodel the company store
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.840]   uh a couple years ago that's right that's right a few months you must go it really i don't know
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.400]   how will translate to a bigger store that is designed to be in a mall where regular people are
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:08.120]   gonna come but boy that's the company store looks really antiseptic and sterile and boring
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:13.080]   it's so here's the old place used to be a lot of the old place was a lot of fun because it looked
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:19.880]   like a regular store it said please come in explore see what we have this one is like hello i i am i
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:25.720]   am i am employee unit number 12 i am now free to assist you to answer your specific query if you
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.280]   do not have a specific query i will stare at you blankly wondering why it came into the store if
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.160]   you do not have a specific query like i thought i when i thought it's interesting i went to i don't
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.760]   know if this is one of the new store looks or whatever but i went to the court of adera
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:44.280]   you know one that's just just near near here and what i was what i noticed was how sparse it had
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.880]   become you know so it used to be there was lots of shelves and there was all this stuff now they
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.160]   opened it up you know they had theaters when they first started making these and then they got rid
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.400]   of the theaters yeah now they're now they're bringing them all back and they're like little like
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.600]   squares on the floor that you can sit on and there's a little screen there and everything else but
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.760]   they cleared out a lot of that area um they've gotten rid of all the registers of course because
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.640]   everyone just takes your order wherever you're standing um or you do your own order um and then
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.920]   and then but what's interesting is is how little is on the shelves like it's all the apple products
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.680]   and it's really just i think it's going to become extremely competitive to be in the apple store
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.160]   because i think they've cut out like it looked like it cut out two thirds of the of the you know
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.600]   what was on the shelves before yeah and everything everything is everything is everything is behind
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:34.120]   like hidden drawers we you will see one example of it and then the rest of the stock is behind there
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.640]   and it's just it's just a little hard to get used to you're used to just thinking hey i'm gonna
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.560]   brow oh great they've got i like this case let me pick it up and test it and then we'll look through
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:45.880]   the see one of the kinds of cases in different colors so i don't think it's encouraging people
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.280]   to linger i think it's like come in give us your money we'll give you something please leave
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.920]   well it might have been in answer to a problem the apple stores were getting really crowded for a
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.640]   while yeah right you could every store was just jammed with people and i bet you
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.080]   you know half of them were just looking at stuff and half of them were surfing the web
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.120]   it's great internet great place to get some Wi-Fi if you need it yeah well not even that it was
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:13.160]   there was just always somebody there's always people posting on facebook or somewhere um from
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.080]   any Mac that was connected to the internet there you everyone always get in there go to the web
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.600]   and start updating because they're traveling and they're in San Francisco and they got you know
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:25.640]   this is a place to upload well they kind of asked for it in San Francisco with the trees and the
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:30.440]   you know yeah forest of the apple store i still haven't visited that store i haven't been to the
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.800]   new one i've only you know obviously spent a lot of time in the old one but on the cross street
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:39.720]   from virgin yeah yeah the store in Munich is always uh day and night there's people there
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:45.480]   even if the store is closed on Sundays and whatever outside outside they're hanging outside using the
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.920]   Wi-Fi yeah do they serve beer is it true they've ever heard this they serve beer in the apple store
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.560]   immunocontal i think it's a missed opportunity is a genius bar should be a bar they're bar
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:04.280]   they're genius bar bar this is but then we don't we don't have the noses we don't have the genius
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:12.200]   bar actually serving beer what happened to the apple that was fun yeah apple used to be fun yeah
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:19.320]   back in the day i'm gonna know it's only money you would solve the sliding tiles puzzle and what
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.880]   they what would you get you'll get a whistling dancing penguin where is the apple that decided
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:29.240]   we want to reward people with a whistling dancing penguin there is a connection between Tim Cook
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:37.240]   and Elon musk apparently apple bought new testing machines for its batteries developed by tesla's
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:45.160]   battery research partner um batteries are big and getting better batteries is huge and you know
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:50.040]   i have to say credit to uh Elon and tesla because they're really pushing this technique this lithium
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.440]   mind technology as far as it can go uh and they're building that big you know they built that big
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:22:00.360]   giga factory building that he's gonna build more he says in the u.s well i think i think that when
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:04.440]   you look at the combination i mean this is a little little bit of a rat hole but but i i we were in
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:10.040]   the bunch of discussions internally about Elon musk and how far he's pushing uh the industry
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.800]   well how do we talk about carbon emissions and everything else he's probably doing more than any
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:19.640]   single person to affect yeah emissions when you look at you know a solar solution a battery
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:25.000]   solution that fixes that solar solution and then cars that essentially will be when your solar
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.760]   solutions work in your battery solutions work in your cars are almost free to drive you know because
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.440]   there's not you know they're not uh they're they're you're getting i got 30 panels in my roof that
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:40.840]   charges my tesla i it's an amazing feeling to drive around town knowing i generated the power
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:46.360]   to drive down and it's a great car it's a fun car to drive we're doing the same thing we have
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:51.480]   20 kilowatts driving uh you have a generating power for our leaf yeah and and it really is
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:56.040]   interesting how it changes your attitude towards driving because we were always that kind of those
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.120]   kind of people who would like well if we're going out we better make sure we're doing all the errands
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:05.720]   yep and it's not that we're driving randomly now but there's just a little bit less of stress
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:11.560]   involved with yeah um wasting energy um you know i'm burning fossil fuels it's all just out there
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:17.720]   in the field picking up solar yep it's really true all right let's take a break and prepare
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.080]   your picks and i'll i'll have right you know you you didn't expect to be here but if you have
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:24.120]   something to pick i'll let you do that something cool something different something different
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.480]   something spot it could be a shoe it could be something in your briefcase i'll show you
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:34.840]   well i guess something but but we'll talk about it in a second but first let's talk about our
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:42.520]   sponsor wordpress.com i've moved my blog to wordpress.com it's really a homecoming for me for 10 years i
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:49.000]   ran a self-hosted wordpress.com that's where leoville was and so moving to wordpress.com it's great they
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.400]   keep the software up to date they run the back end and then there's a secondary benefit to going
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:59.880]   to wordpress.com that i really like is there's a whole community there if you go to wordpress.com
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:07.480]   they promote websites you people can follow you they can favorite you you get a lot of traffic
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:14.360]   directly from wordpress which is really interesting of course wordpress is the definitive platform
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:21.800]   for creating a website whether it's a blog or for your business so many publications that we know

[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:51.160]   oh oh
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:58.520]   echo laughter so uh oh i i would like to i i am recommending uh this week uh a goody but oldy
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:06.120]   uh the iphone 6s what you're nuts it's one Alex though there's something to be said for that i
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:14.520]   have i have gone back um i have from the seven i'm gonna give somebody else the seven um the uh
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.000]   and i'm i'm eating crow right now because i said it didn't matter that apple took away the headphone
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   jack and i finally had one trip where i lost it and i was like i'm done i'm done like i can't
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.480]   such a pain in the butts i bought five of the of the blood dafters because the first the first
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.720]   week i lost it and i couldn't find it so then i went to amazon i bought five of them and i put
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:39.000]   them everywhere and then i'm on the road in a place that doesn't have an apple store and they're not
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.160]   easy to find you know like you know locally and i now i'm holding this thing up and i don't have
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.480]   any headphones and everything else and i was just like enough enough you know like and i
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.360]   and so i i miss the two x you know the two x video i mean that's the one thing that i i think i don't
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:29:02.280]   miss the portrait thing and my daughter's got curly hair and doesn't work so um the uh um i do miss
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:07.640]   the two x because i take slow motion of my son every time he bats um at the unbase ball and then
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:13.080]   we then we talk about his his batting um you know with the slow motion and um but i can do that i
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.160]   turned out that the the wide angle was fine so i've been kind of converting to that um i actually
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.680]   got two i got the the success and then i got uh i got the uh se which i like a lot um the se is actually
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.320]   what i spend most of my time talking on the phone on because it fits in my pocket better um and uh
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:32.920]   and i because i have a you know t-mobile when i travel and so so anyway so uh but i just i couldn't
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.720]   maybe the the in part of it is also that apple doesn't i walk into the apple store i could
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:44.040]   probably pre-order them but i you know they haven't figured out the whole um getting those getting
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.360]   their air pods available that you just walk in and get them because i would have done that you know
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:55.400]   a long time ago i don't get around to ordering things sometimes the uh the but i just decided that
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:01.320]   i'm not really a wireless person either i really liked it too wired and um and so i uh so anyway
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:08.360]   so i went back and i'm and i was wrong the the lightning the lightning finally over not having a
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.320]   lightning port uh finally or not having a headphone jack finally overcame all the other images of the
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:19.320]   phone you know it so so the uh so anyway that's that's my recommendation five not that i'm i can't say
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:24.840]   i disagree with you i love the air fortunately i love the air pods and i'll use those but i do i
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:30.440]   mean all my other phones have headphone jacks um well i think the problem is i'm very attached to my
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.160]   my head emotor at a moment that's exactly there for me too i love my headphones for phone calls
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:39.160]   specifically they are the i can hear the best that they don't have the best base but that
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:43.320]   actually means that i can hear the phone call much better very accurate uh and the microphone for
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.400]   whatever reason is better we've tested it against like every headphone jack out there and the
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:52.440]   microphone is better for people on the other end um than anything else we've tested that is
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:58.600]   also just a regular headphone so anyway all over you got a tip for us maybe a great German beer to
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:06.520]   recommend or i i'm gonna pick a place you know the the best place i've been to uh on this trip apart
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:13.160]   from the new studio here which i like really much um it's a silomar seat page uh st isn't a silomar
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:20.040]   great oh um Ted was originally i think it is silomar yeah yeah so and and i i got a chance to see it
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:26.440]   without fog and that's that's really a very proud of uh a silomar there's the
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:31.000]   silomar lodge a lot of conferences used to be there the original Ted was there and then there's a the
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.960]   beautiful beach uh right next to it well i'm glad you saw some of calif some of the real california
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:43.800]   yeah very good choice did you go uh did you go swimming because the ocean's very cold there that's a
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:50.840]   bit cold little bit cold yeah we have these great beaches in uh in northern california but the water is
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:59.880]   freezing and an echo pick of the week uh this is actually a follow up a let just like Alex i was
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:05.720]   late to a certain bandwagon i finally got a pair of air pods uh was last week or week ago that i
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:10.200]   made pick of the week because i liked it and they even worked right with my uh with my android phone
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:16.280]   the only complaint that i made is that uh like i often like to wear headphones or at least one
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:21.880]   headphone while i'm riding my bike and although the ear ear pods were staying put very very well
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:27.320]   when you got these dangly bits on the helmet and you kind of think that this is going to knock the
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.520]   thing that the ear pod the ear pod out of your ear uh and uh fell on twitter that i'm sorry that
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:39.800]   didn't get his name uh recommended the uh spiganteca ear pod ear hooks these are little silicone
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:46.760]   little snappy onny things that slip on to the ear pod and they give you this little extra little
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:51.400]   rubbery thing that will sort of you know nestles into your the loops and whirls inside your your
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:57.480]   ear bone uh and keep it a little bit more secure uh while still having cutouts for all the important
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:01.720]   things that make the ear pod work the other nice thing they're they're available in all kind in
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:07.480]   like four different colors including black so if you are concerned about one of these things ever
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:12.840]   dropping out and then oh my god this is white and i've just dropped it on on a beach or on and it's
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:18.360]   in i was walking in the snow i'm not going to find this white earbud in the snow well if you put the
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.920]   green or the or the black uh uh ear covers on them maybe you will see some contrast against whatever
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:30.440]   it fell into and they're dirt cheap but they're a 12 bucks and you get a pair of two uh and so
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:36.520]   they're certainly i've been wearing them off and on uh and they're they don't make it less comfortable
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:41.960]   they make it feel a little bit more secure if you've got the sort of shaped ear shape where
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:47.160]   it you feel that it's staying in there but you feel as though it could fall out really easily
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:51.320]   maybe give these a try you might find these fit a little bit more secure uh they certainly don't
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:56.040]   affect the audio any uh and again for 12 bucks prepare two you may as well give them a try i like
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.600]   them a lot i like them too our neighbors you'll you'll you'll have to take them off before you put
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.760]   them in the charging thing though so obviously that's the disadvantage you can't just manage the
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:09.640]   dental floss case yeah but they're easy you'd have to put on and off yeah yeah uh i don't have any
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.360]   problem with earpods falling out so i'm just i'm happy with the stock earpods but a lot of people do
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:20.360]   that will solve it oddly enough uh my pick comes from our neighbors it turns out uh joebe is just
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.760]   around the corner and everyone's while they pop by and they bring us stuff and they brought me this
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.840]   and i'm very excited now we've all seen the gorilla pod before these are the little tripods that
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:35.320]   you know you can bend around anything uh this one has the uh the the mount that fits any phone you
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:41.160]   know any camera phone so i could i could put the camera phone in here very easily then this is nice
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:47.960]   it has a bluetooth uh shutter button it'll pair to the phone you put that on your key chain and so
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:52.920]   you could put the tripod here and take a picture which is very cool and i really like this this is
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:59.560]   the grip type one these are magnetic feet so if you've got something that's magnetic you could just
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:06.680]   attach the phone you can't really see it but you can attach the phone by magnet the tripod by magnet
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:12.200]   so this makes it really really even more flexible and sometimes i have to say you know i i've got
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.120]   when i've been shipboard for instance and wrapped this around the railing on the ship i'm very
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:21.800]   nervous about you know losing my phone overboard the magnets on the feet are very strong and give
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:27.240]   it an additional kind of sense of security 59.95 the grip type one if you want to get
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:36.200]   i need a magnet on my table if you just fell over if you want to get a uh you know get the
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:41.240]   special phone adapter but if you go to jobe you'll see you can add a lot of different uh things this
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.400]   is the mount plus the magnetic gorilla pod there you go i think it needs to actually walk it feels
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.680]   like it's alive doesn't especially when it's in that kind of weird spider mode but i've been very
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.960]   happy with this and i actually it's small enough and light enough that i carry it in my uh briefcase
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:04.680]   so i always have some way to mount a camera phone it makes it very convenient to always have that
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.920]   capability and if you can either keep the bluetooth uh uh trigger on your keychain they've got a
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.640]   little fog for that but it also has a place to mount it right on the back of the tripod so it's
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:24.040]   always there uh to pull off and use very compact very light 60 bucks grip type one we are done
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:30.040]   thank you everybody for joining me today thank you all of her for coming all the way from munich
