[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.200]   It's Andy and not Cole.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.680]   Hi.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680]   Hi.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.680]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   Nice to see you too.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.480]   I'm all our friends in Leo's Video Clubhouse today.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.680]   Oh, hey, Mr. Cherry.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.200]   There he is in Cherry.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.560]   Or la.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.880]   Orps.com.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.800]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.640]   Hello.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.920]   I've come down from the attic.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.640]   Did you see we--
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.520]   Was it warm up there?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   Oh, I get a new room.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.560]   We got a new room in the cottage.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200]   We finally got the whole cottage.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.320]   I started in 2005 in the Garrett Suite, the smallest
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.760]   room in this building.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.160]   And I've slowly metastasized through the building.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.000]   And now we finally have occupied the brain.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.760]   So it's ours.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.280]   It's all ours, baby.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.080]   Is there a trap door in the attic floor
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.120]   with a big iron ring in it that has
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.400]   be pulled up for you to come out again?
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.320]   Occasionally, they'll just throw a ham hock in there
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.360]   and close the floor.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.680]   Unfortunately, this is-- in California,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.920]   we don't have-- we have neither basements nor attics.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.560]   We're such a transient populace here
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440]   that we don't have anything like that.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   So what you see is what you get.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   But this is kind of like a magic door
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.400]   because it's where my bookshelf used to be in the studio here.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.920]   Remember that, Annie, when you had that 3GS
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.360]   that you pretended was a 3?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960]   And you were taking pictures over in that corner
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.240]   where there was the curved bookshelf.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.440]   That bookshelf has disappeared.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.680]   And lo and behold, there was a door behind it all this time.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.760]   So that's kind of fun.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880]   And we go in there and there's a hole in their space.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.200]   You know that they make these bookshelfs that are actually
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.760]   doors if you want to make like hidden doorways into places?
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.640]   I'm obsessed with that.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   Should we do that?
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   Let's do that here.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.240]   My great-grandmother had a whole house like that.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.080]   It's a secret door.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.200]   Well, did she work her up in the Winchester Mystery House?
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.360]   Well, she grew up in the-- they built the house--
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.280]   I think I thought the Winchester Mystery House.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.840]   During the '20s, it was a pretty big house.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.240]   And so the fun thing was when we were kids
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.200]   was running around when I was really little, like eight years old.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   We'd run around trying to find the hidden stuff
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.520]   where they kept all the liquor.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.560]   It was like whole hallways.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.280]   There was like whole hallways and extra hallways
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.760]   and behind the bathtub.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.720]   It was awesome.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   And I was like, I have to have that when I get older.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.920]   Was it built during prohibition?
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.680]   And it was built during prohibition and for prohibition.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.880]   It was great.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.560]   It's neat.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.960]   Let us talk about the Mac.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.200]   Hey, I got my new Apple TV software.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.560]   It just magically appeared on my Apple TV one day.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.480]   I don't remember pressing the update button.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.160]   I haven't turned my on for a little while.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.120]   I hadn't either.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.560]   Yeah, I know.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.160]   So I turned it on.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.320]   I heard that 3-0 came out.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.600]   I know.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.040]   No.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.360]   No, this is telling, isn't it?
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   Neither of us, none of us, all three of us,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520]   have not used our Apple TV in a while.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.440]   Why?
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.360]   Because Roku.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.880]   Exactly.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   Nope.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.640]   The kitchen TV, it also faces the sort of like the salon
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.320]   as I refer to it.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.880]   And I've got a Roku and I've got an Apple TV.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.400]   And I always use the Roku every single morning
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   when I'm eating breakfast.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.120]   I almost never use the Apple TV these days.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.720]   Yep.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.840]   That is so telling.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.120]   I mean, if the three of us are in that boat,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.320]   that's got to be a fairly universal experience.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.280]   What was it about the Apple TV?
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.440]   Well, the Roku, you're not paying for anything.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.280]   I mean, it's the Roku mixed with the--
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.880]   But you are.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.280]   Because you're paying for a Netflix account.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.880]   And I would pay for an Apple account.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.680]   You know, when I did, I dumbed down my Netflix account
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.120]   to one disc.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.920]   So did I?
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.640]   I was at five.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.600]   I was at five, too.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.680]   I said, I'm all--
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.560]   I realized I haven't watched a disc in a year.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560]   In a year?
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.880]   All the bucket list.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.440]   Wow, that must have-- I was going to watch that.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.120]   It's like this, the dust is this thing.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.880]   So I said, I'm never going to watch these screw it.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.000]   I put them into the envelope, set them back,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.360]   went to Netflix, said, one please, and now I've got the Roku.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.360]   I think the big deal though is that the guy who
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.080]   chooses what movies you want to see in the Roku
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.760]   and the guy who actually watches them
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.400]   are two different guys.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.040]   Because I'll be on the web and I'll suddenly
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.880]   think of Harold Lloyd and think, oh, geez.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.840]   Or the movie I just saw on Fox today, the girl can't help it.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.680]   And the next thing is, well, let me see if the girl can't
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.040]   help it isn't on-- oh, well, no, this is not on Netflix.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.120]   But hey, seven-year-aches, well, let's add that to the queue.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   And then next morning, I'm having my breakfast,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   think what's on the Roku.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   Hey, this is seven-year-ish.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.960]   That's awesome.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.040]   It's kind of the-- they should call it the "settle box."
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.240]   The movie you settle for, because the one you want is not
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.000]   in streaming.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.920]   Not yet.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.400]   Well, our takes are such that we want to see more of these.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.880]   How many do you have?
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.120]   We don't care.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.720]   How many do you have in your queue?
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.560]   150.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.680]   Yeah, I have almost 200 in my queue.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.880]   Am I brought to town?
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.200]   I think it is.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.280]   You want to watch.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.680]   But it's all in "Blond Order."
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.600]   It's all movies you kind of want to watch.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.920]   It's all the TV shows.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.040]   Each TV show represents 20 episodes.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   I have all the Miami Vice, all the Red Dwarf, all the--
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.920]   And I'm not counting TV episodes.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.560]   Oh, that's what-- we actually watch more TV episodes.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.440]   Because when we want to watch movies,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.600]   we tend to rent them from the Amazon.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.040]   It's crappy movies.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.640]   No, we tend to rent the movies from Amazon.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.480]   And--
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.840]   I go there, I want to watch Nashville.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.280]   Nashville, you can only get a disc.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   You can't download.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.480]   I presume it's some deal with a movie company.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.040]   So you have to get-- so OK, so then I
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.720]   click Robert Altman's name.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.800]   None of the Robert Altman movies I want to watch are available.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.120]   But guess what?
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.880]   He directed 12 episodes of "Combat."
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.360]   So you could download that.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   It's a little frustrating, but it's getting better.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.600]   Well, they're making a deal.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.000]   I mean, it's one of those things that they're-- like Apple,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.160]   they have to persuade the entertainment industry that this
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.640]   is a good--
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.640]   And we're going to be on it any minute now.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.120]   I know we promised this a while ago,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.040]   but that's happening soon.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.800]   That's awesome.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.960]   That'll be a big thing.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.800]   But wait a minute.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.000]   Let's save Apple TV.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.640]   Can we save it?
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.720]   I mean, 3.0 is a nice improvement.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.560]   It's a big improvement.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.880]   And I think that Apple's figuring-- when you look
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.280]   at what they're doing with Apple TV
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.560]   and what they're doing with the 27-inch iMac, which I still
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.840]   think is just a TV with a Mac built-in,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.000]   that Apple is definitely--
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.800]   this is more than a hobby at this point of where they're going.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.360]   I mean, they really are going for that living.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.440]   I was relieved to see even any update just because it was
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.960]   starting to look like they didn't care.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.880]   And they've also updated it.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   They're already more than we did.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.680]   There's really interesting interaction.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   There's a new remote for the iPhone.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.640]   And you're really looking at this integrated lifestyle
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.480]   and being able to watch it on--
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.160]   Euchar says something interesting here at Chatroom.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.240]   He says, just lose the hardware.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   Apple TV really is really about the software, isn't it?
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.560]   Yeah, but Apple's business model
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.360]   is all about the integration of both of them.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.200]   You lose the hard way--
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.280]   But I mean, put it on a Mac, put it
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.240]   with the functionality in front row.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.080]   Well, a lot of that functionality is in front row.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.600]   Is it?
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   Yeah, I mean, front row is--
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.640]   Front row, huh.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.840]   And a big chunk of that.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.040]   That's what makes the Mac mini really work,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.840]   is that you can do the front row stuff right from the Mac
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.320]   mini.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.160]   That's nice.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.200]   But I don't think people can spend a little under 200 bucks
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.040]   for an Apple TV.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.360]   They can't really say, I spent 1,000 bucks for this MacBook
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:56.880]   two years ago.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.800]   I know it was two years ago.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.960]   But that-- and that's not as well
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.520]   as that plug into the TV.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   But to me, the intriguing thing, let's say,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.360]   about Apple TV 3.0, it didn't really
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.960]   add any new functions apart from just supporting
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.920]   the new products that are available on the iTunes Store
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.880]   with a new album art and the new bonus features
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.400]   on the videos that you buy.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.960]   To me, I think it's very telling that the way
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.320]   that they reconfigured their menu system
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.120]   is that it's no longer cluttered onto one screen.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.720]   It's set up so that it's like a horizontal bar
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.680]   with the implication that every time they want to add
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.640]   a new feature, they can simply add infinitely to the left
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.120]   and infinitely to the right.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.840]   So it makes me wonder if they're going to be--
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   if next year they're going to start adding new built-in
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.200]   services or at least open up an app store
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.080]   like plug-in architecture so that when you add in the Netflix,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.200]   when you add in NFL, when you add in Major League Baseball,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.800]   when you add in Amazon, when you add in all this sort of stuff,
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.280]   you won't have this huge tile floor effect.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.200]   It'll just simply next, next, next, next, next
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   as you keep on navigating.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.560]   Well, OK, but I already bought an Apple TV.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.320]   Why not?
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.080]   It's OK.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.520]   I'm just looking for that one feature that would bring me--
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.200]   that would-- right now, the Roku box
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.120]   is the center of my TV watching it,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.360]   too, for that one VMN.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.240]   If you put Netflix streaming on the Apple TV,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.440]   would that do it?
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.320]   Then I would be picking up the remote for the Apple TV.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.160]   And on top of that, I would be using the Apple TV more
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.920]   to access the content that I've got on my home media
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.880]   service here.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.680]   I do have Steve Jobs' favorite home stereo system,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.280]   the iPod high-fi in the kitchen.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.200]   And when I'm cleaning, when I'm doing cooking and stuff
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.160]   like that, I just dock my iPhone.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   I have this $200 sophisticated Apple TV,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.720]   hooked up to much better speakers,
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.680]   hooked up to a graphical user interface.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.560]   But it doesn't occur to me to use it.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.640]   It just occurs to me to just put my iPhone
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.680]   into this little dock and play it through these speakers.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.520]   I think that's a telling problem for Apple.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.680]   And I think even if I'm thinking if they put the Roku on it,
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.440]   how would I--
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.400]   or Netflix streaming, I should say, not the Roku.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.120]   But if they put Netflix streaming on it, how would I feel?
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.000]   And I still would use the Roku because it's solid.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.120]   It works.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.720]   And the Apple TV is a little flaky and slow,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.640]   and sometimes it doesn't respond.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.520]   Well, but the thing I will say about, though,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.920]   that with the Roku is that when you have a lot of stuff in it
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.960]   or you are trying to find a movie,
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   it is a bit of a pain in the neck.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.160]   It doesn't scale well right now.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.920]   I'm sure they're going to work on that interface.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.320]   It has the same problem that the early Apple TV had,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.400]   which is that if I want to go through and find a movie
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.280]   that I want to watch--
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   Oh, it's just like--
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.440]   You know that--
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.720]   I asked the Roku guy about that,
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.000]   and you can-- if you press the fast forward button,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.320]   it goes through a whole page at a time.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.280]   Did you know that?
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.400]   I did not know that, but it's still--
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.240]   It's still a little--
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.080]   It's still a little--
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.440]   I want to be able to search for something.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.120]   And I know you can't do that with a little controller,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.040]   but it's--
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.720]   Well, it's kind of OK.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.800]   I think the people who are going to be buying a Roku box
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.040]   are not the people who are buying a component for television.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.280]   They're thinking more along the lines of the stuff
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.200]   that I would normally be streaming to my notebook.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.360]   Now I can stream to my TV set.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.600]   But they definitely need to change the user interface.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.680]   Just now I've opened up my Instant Cue on Netflix
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.280]   and notice that I have 321 movies lined up.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.080]   And if I don't occasionally do a little maintenance too,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.040]   they recently added the Mitchell and Web look to Netflix.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   And yes, definitely.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.360]   And if I have to add it and make sure
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.840]   that I've popped it all the way to the top of the list,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.400]   along with the Barclays Abroadway, which, as a matter of fact,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.080]   I added it a long time ago, but have never managed to see,
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.880]   this is the sort of stuff I have to do groundhog date.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.560]   Let's pop that to the top of the list.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   Because if you don't do that sort of maintenance--
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.000]   You'll never find it.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.480]   Exactly.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.640]   By the time you're done holding down the button,
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.360]   it's like, what the hell was I looking for anyway?
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.000]   About a guy with a car and there was a girl with the hell.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.680]   Whatever, Colombo.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.880]   Good watch Colombo.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.600]   That's what I mean.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.120]   It's the--
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.160]   I'll settle for whatever comes up next.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.360]   But that's a lot like regular TV now.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.400]   To turn this to Apple, according to All Things Digital,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.960]   the Wall Street Journal, Apple has
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.480]   been pitching television networks on making a subscription
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.080]   service.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.560]   Now this is an interesting product, $30 a month.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.960]   To watch TV via iTunes, you would maybe use the Apple TV
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.240]   or you'd use your iTunes or your Apple
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.320]   to basically get your TV channels.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.080]   Apparently, according to All Things Digital,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.440]   they are not tying it to the Apple TV box or any other device
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.720]   like a slate.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.440]   But they're presenting the offer as an extension of iTunes.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.840]   Which I think is important when you look at the 27-inch iMac
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.080]   with a Visa mount.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   That's a TV.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.320]   I mean, if you can get that live--
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.800]   That's what Calicana's was talking about, I'm sure.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.600]   Because if they get that, that is--
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.240]   I mean, I would definitely get that for my house.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   That would be my TV.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.760]   I mean, I don't need to have all the other stuff.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.720]   The question is, will that be in the best interest
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.360]   of the networks and the cable broadcasters?
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.760]   Because I have a limited--
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.280]   this is even separate from however much money a year
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.600]   I make or do not make.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.120]   I have a limited amount of budget money for getting TV
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.040]   and getting entertainment into my house
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.480]   that I feel as though, even if I were making $1/2 million
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.440]   a year, there'd be a point in which I'd say, look,
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   I'm not going to spend $30 a month for basic cable.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.400]   Then $30 a month to get the same content via iTunes.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.920]   Then another $18 a month to get more content via Netflix.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.120]   That would be the point in which I'd have to decide,
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.000]   what package am I going to get via iTunes?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.720]   And I would simply cancel my cable.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.400]   And so that's definitely going to be a metric
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   in any conversation.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.200]   No one-- but remember, there's no love loss
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.160]   between the cable companies and the networks.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.080]   The cable companies are eating network profits.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.960]   The networks would love to this intermediate.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.520]   At least have some kind of competition,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.440]   have some kind of leverage to get that sort of amount.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.800]   Maybe they give a chunk to Apple, too.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.640]   But I think that they don't necessarily--
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.400]   they're not in the beds of the cable company.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.880]   Well, I think that the issue is that the cable company--
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.720]   well, the question always comes up.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.360]   And I think this was the thing that--
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.240]   correct me if I'm wrong-- was a problem for tech TV,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.600]   which is that the cable companies can get real nasty
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.120]   about this.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.040]   If you start saying we're going to put stuff online,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   or we're going to start--
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.400]   they'll say, well, we'll drop you.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.680]   It was in our contracts.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.480]   We couldn't do it.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.200]   Right.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.480]   So that's the challenge.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.720]   But I think that at some point in time,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.560]   the cable companies have to get that they are going
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.320]   to be commoditized.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.720]   They are going to be the pipe.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.560]   That's what-- and they're moving towards that.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.760]   Because we're going to still-- for instance, we have Comcast.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.600]   We have Comcast cable.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.880]   If Apple came out, I would happily drop my cable subscription.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.040]   But I'm still going to probably have Comcast supplying me with data.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.680]   This is why it's so hard for an existing established business
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.200]   to make these leaps to a new business model.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.040]   Because you've got one foot in both worlds.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.400]   Here's a perfect example.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.320]   CNN doesn't do what we're doing on Twit Live,
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.360]   because it's got agreements with cable companies
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   that would piss the cable companies off.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.520]   In fact, they may not even be allowed to.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.320]   Now, remember, though, that Jobs is on the board at Disney.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.480]   It seems like if anybody--
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.640]   as Steve Jobs is Disney's single, largest single shareholder,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.440]   if anybody's going to do this, it would be Disney.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.280]   Now, the question is--
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.080]   But they're OK, but again, they have relationship with cable companies.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.800]   Well, not only that, they have to-- I mean,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.600]   you're not going to get people to pay $30 for ESPN and ABC.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.240]   And whatever else, Disney owns, it's not going to be enough.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.640]   You really have to have a whole package.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.680]   I don't think these companies-- go ahead.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.200]   I know if that's not necessarily true.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.480]   Every now and then, I do pause at every single bill
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.560]   that I'm paying over the course of the month.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.080]   And thinking that this is--
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.400]   I don't spend a fortune on cable,
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.080]   but if I had the ability to choose channels all a cart,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.920]   if I just went up to my DVR right now
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.080]   and looked at what are the channels you're actually watching,
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.280]   I think I'd be down to the broadcast networks
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.640]   plus six channels tops.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   And if I had the ability to buy those six channels all a cart,
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.800]   that would be a really interesting proposition.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.080]   It's interesting for the consumer,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.720]   but I used to work at a cable network.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.920]   And we had a lot of discussions about--
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.720]   because I was a big fan of the idea
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.000]   that we should just be offering this all a cart.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.960]   But the problem is, is that once you go to all a cart,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.840]   it doesn't-- the business model, because everyone's--
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.360]   you're getting paid by a subscriber,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.680]   and that cost is being distributed among everybody
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.320]   to make it actually worthwhile to do it.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.080]   If you went all a cart, it would be too unstable,
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.040]   and a lot of cable networks would just go away.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.720]   And the ones that you got would be a lot more expensive.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.800]   HBO is whatever $8 or $10 a sub when it's everybody.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.440]   But HBO would become $60 a sub if people were all
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.640]   a carting into it.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   And so the thing is, is that it would become very expensive
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.120]   very quickly.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.080]   That distribution makes it possible for us
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.520]   to get so many channels where they're all
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.040]   getting just a little sip from the model,
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.080]   because a big part of their business model-- and once again,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.720]   Leo, you probably know more about this than I do.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.280]   But the big part of this business model
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.760]   is getting that money from the subscribers,
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.360]   for many of the networks.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.680]   And so if that goes away, a lot of the smaller ones,
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.400]   a lot of the ones that we would like to see
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.240]   would go away pretty quickly.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.200]   But on the other hand, this is what these companies
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.000]   are doing with Hulu.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.440]   I mean, in fact, there's rumors that Hulu
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.240]   wants to do a subscription service.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.000]   Well, it's not so much they want to do a subscription service
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.760]   as much as they want to start to monetize all this content.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.080]   It has to do with the change of ownership.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.440]   And they're saying, why the hell are we
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.520]   giving away this content?
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.960]   Well, you're basically-- it's like, people don't have a right
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.840]   to get anything for free.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   They're not getting enough money from the commercials.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.400]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.800]   And they'll give us $180 a month for it.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.720]   Well, I'm happy.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.440]   I'm a very happy subscriber for many of these things.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.080]   I mean, I subscribe to my--
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.160]   I have a cable network.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.720]   And the thing I have my internet connection, I have my Zoom.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.160]   We pay.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.680]   My Zoom has--
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.440]   Look, we're all paying hundreds of dollars a month now
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.120]   on content.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.080]   I mean, it's easy to get.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.560]   I would love to just be able to know that my content bill was
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.200]   $100 or $150 a month.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.440]   And then I could just watch movies and watch shows
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.560]   and watch whatever.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.360]   To me, that would work great.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.640]   Because I'm a pretty heavy consumer.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.640]   This conversation is kind of making me wonder,
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.080]   if I shouldn't just experimentally-- because I'm
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.440]   not under contract with anybody-- to simply say,
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.600]   I'm going to cancel every single subscription entertainment
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   service I have right now.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.640]   And spend a couple months seeing how far I can go without having
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.160]   anything.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.400]   And then only resubscribe to the stuff I'm actually interested in.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.000]   And I'm curious to see how well I would do without cable TV.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.440]   You'd have to keep a spreadsheet for us
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.880]   so we'd know if it costs more to do the a la carte.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.800]   And my suspicion is it costs a lot less.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.640]   You pay for what?
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.400]   I went 10 years without cable.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:24.960]   And I really--
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   I've done that.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.800]   --without TV.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.720]   Yeah, I don't mind that.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   But that's not what we're talking about here.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.960]   When I came back to it, when my wife got on TV,
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.400]   I realized that I moved very quickly back to just watching
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   whatever was available and not buying all the cars.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.040]   You know, I was like, I don't feel like--
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.880]   No, it's a good model for the cable companies.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.240]   It's a good model for the networks.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.880]   It wasn't that bad of a model for me.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   With DVR.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.120]   You know, I mean, it was just like, I just record everything.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.440]   I still don't watch anything live, you know, really.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.840]   Except for like, steel--
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.120]   That's clearly happening.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.680]   I mean, I think I've already mentioned before that I--
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   as not as a new year's resolution,
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.600]   as much as as an experiment I decided to spend 2009,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.480]   trying to see if I could go the entire year
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.880]   without acquiring any physical media of any kind.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.800]   And I found it-- I thought I had three event marshals
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.200]   that I could float, like, get rulings from.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.080]   So if you really want to get this, is this technically--
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.880]   Are you asking, is this physical?
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.760]   Yeah, no, no, literally.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.880]   It's like, does this count as physical media?
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.440]   If I'm just getting-- if I'm buying this just long enough
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.840]   to convert it into a digital format,
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.040]   then we just post the written games.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   No, that's interesting.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.760]   That's sort of stuff.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.960]   The idea being, can I get by without buying anything on DVD,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   anything on CD, anything on book?
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   Not with the understanding that anything that I would want
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.480]   to read would be available via a digital download.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.280]   But would there be enough content out there
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.880]   that I wouldn't really notice that I can't buy the two volumes
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.320]   of the complete peanuts that came out this year?
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.520]   And I found that it's actually been very, very easy
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.480]   to do without it.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.960]   So it's not so much finding ways to replace this discovery
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.400]   channel or just to replace the learning channel so much as,
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.320]   am I getting so much entertainment out of this
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.440]   that I would miss it if I did not have it available?
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   If I suddenly couldn't see dirty jobs the week that it airs,
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.560]   I would have to wait for it to come out on DVD
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.520]   or wait for it to come out on some sort of a download.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.400]   Would that be a pain?
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.120]   In this day and age where I don't have to shovel coal
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.920]   for a living or have one of my arms cut off and ground up
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.280]   into an industrial machine for three cents an hour,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.760]   can I endure that hardship of waiting a year
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.600]   to see dirty jobs?
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.400]   I think I can.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.920]   I definitely can't.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.760]   I wait a year to watch 24.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.040]   I mean, I don't even bother with 24 and lost
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.000]   and everything else until the season's done.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   It's all in one place.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.640]   Because I don't want to, and mostly for that,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.080]   I just don't want to wait a week.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.240]   I don't want to be stuck on a cliffhanger.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.160]   I just want to watch all of them on a Saturday afternoon.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.520]   Now, according to Engadget, bad news for you,
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   the 27-inch max might be having performance issues.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.360]   I know what performance issues are all about,
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.840]   and let me tell you, they're bad.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.240]   They're bad.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.520]   - More of those commercials I wouldn't get to see
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.600]   if I canceled my cable.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.840]   - Exactly.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.120]   The most common symptom according to Engadget,
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.320]   incredibly slow flash video playback.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.160]   - Of course, I'll have that too.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   - People are also claiming there's a bug forcing
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.520]   the hard drive to spin down.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.120]   There's a corrupted snow leopard build
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   pre-installed, and even that the problem is bad permissions.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   Bad permissions.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.960]   - I'm figuring all this will be fixed by the time I...
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.400]   - You get your 27?
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   I've ordered it, but it hasn't been.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.880]   - I'm waiting for the quad.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.960]   - Yeah, I ordered the quad.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.200]   - So it's not coming out until next month.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.320]   - Which is basically how OS 10 user gives up,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.800]   gives up trying to figure things out.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.720]   Apple hasn't said anything yet, but rather,
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.160]   neither the 27-inchers we have are having problems.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   So, you know, I mean, there's--
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.080]   - It's a new product.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.840]   - A new product, if even 1/10th of 1% of people
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.760]   have problems with it, you're gonna hear
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.800]   thousands of postings.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.640]   So, you know, you just can't tell.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.320]   Anectotal, you know, postings on the Apple forums
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.320]   only tell you that somebody's having problems,
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   not that, not what percentage of people are having problems.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.160]   - Right.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.720]   - So I don't know, but we'll keep an eye on that.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.080]   You and I both ordered one.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.520]   - I didn't, I haven't ordered it yet, I was waiting.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.280]   - Oh, I ordered, 'cause it, you know,
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.640]   it doesn't still doesn't come even if you order it.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.480]   (laughing)
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.720]   You don't have to worry about that.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.240]   - They do bill you, however.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.600]   - Well, I bought a lot of stuff last month,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.040]   but I figured I would wait until it was actually shipping.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.160]   - Yeah, it's not something that I really want,
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.080]   it's not something that I really need.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   And so.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.920]   - What is this, deal?
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.160]   Apple, according to Apple Insider,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.400]   is disabling Adam's support with 10.6.2.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.800]   - Well, that takes all the fun out of Hackintosh
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.240]   in your netbook.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.640]   - Yeah, that's what that's all about.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.440]   - It's to kill Hackotoshes.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.280]   - Apple can identify it very quickly,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.800]   because they're not using that chip,
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.200]   so they can just say, look for the chip, turn it off.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.120]   - You're using, the 10.6.2 is not out yet.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.160]   Users at OS 10 Daily claim that 10.6.2 prevents snow
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.760]   leopard from running on systems with Adam processors.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.320]   Of course, Adam is not on any Apple product,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.420]   so it wouldn't hurt anybody who's a legitimate user.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.680]   - I'm just a legitimate user, I love America.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.600]   - You're not legitimate, you're a bastard.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.680]   - I love to know how this decision came across,
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.840]   because it's one of those aha moments,
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.920]   where I'm sure that for months and months and months,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.560]   Apple thought, well, you know what?
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.120]   We really don't want, we hate it
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.240]   that people are hackintoshing these things,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.120]   but it's not that big of a dent in our sales,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.920]   and it's not as though,
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.640]   it would take too much trouble to shut it off,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.720]   so it's not shut it off.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.240]   And there just must have been this moment
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.960]   when someone realized, wait a minute,
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.840]   every single netbook uses the Adam N270 processor.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.960]   Can't we just add three lines of code that says,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.560]   if you're using this processor?
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.640]   - It's kind of like blocking the sync with the pre.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   It's just, it seems like it has to go through
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.480]   some machinations before they do it,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.320]   but it's a simple thing.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.160]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.320]   - I guess it's different from blocking sync to the pre.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   The blocking syncing to the pre is essentially
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.760]   shutting off whatever stupid hack that Palm is doing
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.080]   to get their device into iTunes.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.440]   It's a little, it's not a proud moment for Apple,
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.800]   but I think that Palm is doing something
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.000]   a little bit sneaky there.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.560]   With, by shutting off access to the N270,
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.120]   I really think that Apple is kind of showing
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.240]   some sour grapes.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.840]   They can't be losing a lot of business to hack and toss.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.120]   Because it's, you can build, you can,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.920]   you can create a format that will be better.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.760]   - I got news for you.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.920]   They ain't losing a lot of business to the pre either.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.360]   - Yeah, so well, the difference is that the pre sucks.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.720]   At least like a Dell Mini 10 V that's running Mac OS X
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.480]   is a very, very functionally useful thing
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.200]   that you don't want to throw through a window closed or open.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.680]   - I know a lot of geeks, serious geeks who have hack and tosses.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.880]   - You see a lot of them in the airports.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.720]   - Yeah.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.560]   - They take the Apple sticker and they stick it over top of the--
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   - That's probably what happened is that Steve
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.800]   or somebody was at the airport and saw these little--
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.320]   - Wait a minute.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.800]   - I want it easy, it's a low hanging fruit.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.760]   There's no, you know, for them,
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.200]   there's not really any reason not to.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.440]   Because they've said that they don't want people installing it.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.040]   So, you know, they're very clear about how they feel
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.520]   about the situation.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.360]   - Yeah.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.760]   - It's probably a flick of a risk to make it very difficult
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.000]   to use it on those smaller machines,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.560]   which I think is a place where a lot of people are using them.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.680]   - According to Grock Law, we're talking about
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   the SciStar story too here in a way,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.080]   because SciStar offers a $50 hack and tush fix.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:17.680]   Apple says SciStar makes three unauthorized copies of OS X.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.620]   One of them in Apple's brief.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.400]   Finally, every time SciStar turns on any of the SciStar
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.920]   computers running Mac OS X, which it does before shipping
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.520]   each computer, SciStar necessarily makes a separate,
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.240]   modified copy of OS X in RAM.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.080]   This is the third unlawful copy.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.520]   Oh, I love lawyers. - That's a great,
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.520]   I don't see any problems with any reliability
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.600]   or performance issues with that.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.840]   If I could give them twice as much money for this,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.000]   clearly well thought out system,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.960]   I'd give them eight times as much money.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.720]   - SciStar's response, copying a computer program
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.040]   into RAM as a result of installing and running that program
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.960]   is exactly the copying that section 117 of the DMCA
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.720]   provides does not constitute copyright infringement
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.000]   for a computer program.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.360]   Oh, this is all just legal battles back and forth
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   between SciStar and Apple.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.200]   I just think it's funny.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.480]   The Apple lawyers said, "Hey, they're making three."
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.240]   - Went every time, every time.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.640]   They sell us a SciStar computer.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.680]   Besides an angel losing its wings,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.480]   they're making three copies on authorized copies of OS X.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.760]   One of them in RAM.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.280]   - Are we still looking for a slate?
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.240]   An Apple slate? Anybody?
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.840]   - Bueller. - In the spring?
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.960]   - Bueller won't be this year 'cause who was it?
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.520]   Schiller said, "We're done." - We're done.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.600]   - Nothing more.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.760]   This is our lineup for 2009.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.680]   Don't expect nothing.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.840]   So I guess the slate will be next year.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.320]   - Yeah.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.160]   - Or not.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.000]   - You know, the thing is,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   is I will say that if the slate came out during CES,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   it would make a big splash.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   It would pretty much wipe out everybody else's PR.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.840]   - That's why we're gonna be at CES.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.480]   Just in case.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.320]   Is Apple gonna be at CES to we know?
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.800]   - I don't think they will, but they wouldn't need to be.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.720]   That's the crazy thing.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.960]   Is Apple gonna just release this?
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.000]   - Oh, they don't need to be there.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.640]   - No, they could release the slate that week.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.800]   They could do their own press event.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.320]   If they did their own press event, they would--
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.720]   - In Cupertino, and we're gonna be down in all in Vegas,
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   and they're gonna do, what?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.720]   Damn them, watch.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.640]   - That's exactly the thing Steve would do to me.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.800]   I think he's targeting me.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.640]   He's after me.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.480]   - No, you're bitter.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.640]   - He said I'm bitter or nothing.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.040]   Now let's see, where's LePork gonna be on January 11th?
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   - Great, he's in Vegas.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.800]   Quick, let's have an event.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.200]   - You know, you're only one Virgin America flight back.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.040]   - That's true.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.880]   - But all our equipment will be down there.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.280]   - Make it sound as though if you pull a wall sconce
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.080]   at a certain conference from the conference table,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.880]   flips over with a huge miniature display
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.520]   of like the city and where is Leo LePork right now?
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.760]   (laughing)
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.680]   Seems to be making a move towards the Donut place.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.320]   - Pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.160]   Let's see.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.480]   Okay, this is a pretty far-fetched.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.360]   This is from Silicon Valley Insider.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.200]   Apple is working on some sort of tablet computer,
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.640]   which has reportedly been eating up much of Steve Jobs' time.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.920]   So it makes sense that Apple engineers
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.400]   would be spending more time on planes lately.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.440]   Indeed, a source tells us.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.520]   - A source.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.920]   - This is the worst.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.720]   This is the worst story I've ever read.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.080]   This is the kind of story we for years refuse to do,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.920]   but I'm gonna do anyway, 'cause I think it's just funny.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.360]   A source tells us a system integration engineer
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.480]   friend of his at Apple has been ramping up his travels
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.720]   back and forth between China lately,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.680]   broadcasting words of his travels over the internet.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.920]   Well, let's see, that's one thing that's changed.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.080]   We have Twitter now.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.920]   - Right.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.960]   - We can follow these guys.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.800]   - So he's not even telling him.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.440]   He's just saying, having fun in Shanghai.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.240]   - Yeah, I'm in Shanghai right now.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   There's even, according to this unsourced,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.720]   ridiculous story in the Silicon Valley Insider,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.320]   there's even a few weeks scheduled
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.960]   during the Christmas holiday season.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.920]   Why would you go to China for Christmas?
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.240]   - Evidently, I hear the chow me.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.120]   - Christmas chow me is, oh, that's wonderful.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.920]   They make a Christmas cookie and Beijing you would die for.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.600]   - Has anybody who ever seen a Christmas story
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.840]   will tell you that's where you wanna get your Christmas dinner?
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.880]   - Absolutely.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.040]   The duck, fantastic.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.280]   Remember that Peking duck, Annie?
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.840]   That was good.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.040]   - That was good.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.840]   Everything, many things in China were very, very good.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.440]   Including, including Wellesley,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.920]   also including the bootleg iPhone that I bought,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.800]   that was about a perfect match for the real iPhone 3GS.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.640]   - You still use it?
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.720]   - I still use it, I get much entertainment from it.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   (laughing)
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.440]   It is a thing of great, it's wonderful to see, you know,
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   what if Johnny I've worked at Apple
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.280]   but they had hired the Windows Mobile
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.840]   like software team for everything else.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.480]   - Ooh, wow, this is great.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.320]   Turn it on.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.000]   - Oh, that is disappointing.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.520]   - The bastard child.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.800]   - I know you are both excited about that.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.960]   Are you a Lightroom guy, Andy, or an aperture guy?
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.240]   - Aperture, I love them both.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.560]   I want them sticking with aperture chiefly
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.080]   because I prefer the user interface, but that's about it.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.480]   - And Alex, you're an aperture guy, right?
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.320]   - I am.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.600]   - See, I'm a Lightroom guy, so I'm excited
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.720]   because Lightroom 3 isn't beta.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.880]   But according to Amazon, in a book,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.080]   they accidentally pre-released, "Appature X."
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.040]   Or is it 10?
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.560]   - It does sound like it's getting,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   I think it's generally 10, isn't it?
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.840]   - But was there an aperture 9?
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.200]   - No, but it's eight. - Aperture 7,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.040]   aperture 654. - What, your point is taken.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.200]   (laughing)
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   - We're gonna go from version 3 to 10.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.280]   - 10?
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.400]   - The book is-- - Well, this is a beta,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   that isn't it.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.040]   (laughing)
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.960]   - The book is tagged as being covered by an NDA
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.800]   with an expected release date on May 2010.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.760]   But apparently, according to another article in HardMac,
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.800]   at hardmac.com, this is a fake date
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.520]   that will be modified as soon as the application
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.080]   becomes available according to our sources
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.640]   with aperture 10.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.280]   Apple decided to align its name with Mac OS 10,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.200]   which is gonna kind of slow down aperture releases
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   if they stick with that.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.120]   10.1.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.160]   And should release this new evolution of its pro-oriented
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   photo editing app at the end of November
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.680]   and maybe before year's end.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.160]   Would you be excited about that?
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.200]   - I would be.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.160]   What would you look for in a new aperture?
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.360]   - So I will say that I know absolutely nothing
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.840]   about the new aperture, so I don't have any insight
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.640]   and information, but if I was looking for what we would
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.360]   end up with aperture, what I'd really wanna see
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.640]   as an aperture user is parity, just all I need them to do
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.000]   is provide parity with iPhoto.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.360]   - So give me all the aperture tools that you have.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.640]   - That's not a lot to ask.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.000]   - No, but it was the same thing.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   - You knock off all the good features,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   make it suck a little bit.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   - Well, the thing is, it makes it really hard
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.160]   'cause I really love a lot of the stuff
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.000]   that's in iPhoto now.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.840]   - All right, how about this?
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.880]   Because this is a feature that I think is superlative
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.720]   in Lightroom that does not exist in apertures,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.200]   regional corrections.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   So let's say you wanna do a color or a levels change
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.800]   in just a region of the photo.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.480]   You can paint it in the Lightroom.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   It's like a mask, very nice feature.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.040]   - Yeah, no, I think we're gonna see some of that.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.040]   But for me, the big thing that would be really important
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.440]   would just be to make sure that I had all the same tools.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.160]   So I don't feel like, oh, I really wanna use iPhoto
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.640]   'cause I want GPS. - What's missing?
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.640]   - Oh GPS, which is a big recognition.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.840]   - Base recognition.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.760]   You know, a lot of that kind of stuff would be--
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.600]   - They're not gonna do that.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.440]   That's the consumer stuff.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.280]   They're not gonna do that.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.120]   - It's very useful.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.320]   I mean, it's like when I'm, you know, all they need to do,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.800]   Alex, is make the aperture database
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.360]   and the iPhoto database the same.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.640]   - Well, that'd be nice.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.800]   - Then you just run either whichever program
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.600]   you want feature-wise.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.280]   I mean, that seems a simple way to do that.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.480]   - Right, so that you don't have to create a set
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.200]   of how to fit it. - When you load in an aperture,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.160]   does it create a new database of photos?
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.000]   Or can I just look at the iPhoto?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.820]   - Yeah, no, it's two.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.660]   - Right now, it's two.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.100]   - I don't know if you can go back and forth.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.200]   I know that it's two different things.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.240]   The vault, I'm copying an aperture vault right now.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.720]   So I can tell you that they're two different ones.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.920]   - Yeah.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.960]   Yeah, see, that's one nice thing about Lightroom
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.560]   is you can say this is where the photos live.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.920]   You have your own catalog with your own modifications
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.800]   and don't move those photos, the originals,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.880]   but that's where the photos live.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.200]   - See, and I like the fact that I do one of the things
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.080]   I like about aperture is that when you have it organized
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.440]   properly, which I don't at the moment,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.600]   you can have these vaults that are kind of set up
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.880]   and it's kind of managing that for you
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.820]   and you can have drives that are dedicated to that.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:38.820]   And it makes sense to have it do all of that for you
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.700]   when you're dealing with large amounts of photos.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.820]   I find that for me, the difference,
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.380]   I don't think this is necessarily the rule
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.220]   of the model Lightroom people say no it isn't,
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.940]   but for me, if I'm working with mass numbers of photos
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.420]   that I wanna do simple corrections on,
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.420]   aperture is really geared towards that.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.860]   If I wanna have a lower number of photos
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.140]   that I wanna have a lot of control over each one,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.020]   I find that Lightroom is a little bit better suited for that.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.980]   And so to me, that's how I kind of look
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.740]   at the two different applications.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   - By the way, jaw 04005 in our chat room says,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.360]   it does load the iPhoto database, he says,
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.560]   that's what I do, but does it make a separate then jaw?
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.100]   Does it make a separate, I think it may,
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.100]   maybe that's why my--
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.020]   - It's a separate database when you do that.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.540]   - That actually might be what's,
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.360]   I'm moving my aperture thing right now
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.440]   because it got really big and I was like,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.500]   I haven't put that much into it.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.000]   So it may have moved it all over.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.800]   - Yeah. I'm a big fan of Lightroom.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.760]   I haven't tried 3.0 yet, but I'm a big fan of it.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.040]   - Partly that's a great application.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.120]   - I spent time with the Lightroom team in Australia,
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.360]   so I know them and I kind of know the product
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.120]   very intimately, spend a lot of time with them,
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.400]   learning the ins and outs of it.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.960]   I think it's more capable in aperture,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.000]   but the aperture thing that made me interested in aperture
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.280]   was the plug-in architecture.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.480]   Are there a lot of good plugins for aperture?
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.520]   - There are a fair number of them.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.040]   I haven't, I don't use them for,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.120]   I don't use aperture that way.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.800]   You know, for the most part, if I,
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.200]   as soon as I want to do any kind of editing,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.320]   I just take it into Photoshop.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.440]   So I'm afraid I don't.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.440]   - So that's why I use Lightroom
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.360]   because it's not Adobe product.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.200]   - Right, yeah.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.440]   - All kinds of things to go.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.280]   - I found that with aperture,
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.320]   there's so many edits that I would do in Photoshop
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.480]   that I can just do with a simple tweak
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.880]   that there was just the other day I took a,
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.160]   one of the reasons, I used the Panorama software
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.040]   for the iPhone almost exclusively as a super wide angle lens,
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   took a picture of a really cool old cars on a parking lot.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.520]   I just needed to make the,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.640]   there's a color weirdness in the white top
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.600]   that made it look a little blue.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.200]   Everything else was great, but that looked blue
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.600]   and was so easy for me to isolate that blue
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.840]   and say, please desaturate that.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.560]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.040]   If there's one feature I'd love to see in the next aperture,
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.800]   it would just make those sort of edits
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.720]   much more transparent and much more closer to the top.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.720]   - And for me, general performance is something
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.560]   that's always important.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.120]   You know, with all of,
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.280]   - That's why I didn't use aperture
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.120]   in the early days.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.640]   - To some degree with all of the,
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.200]   the I apps and everything else,
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.040]   they're using so much of the GPU
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.160]   and so much of the power of the computer.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.760]   The problem is that oftentimes they're ahead
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.040]   of where the processors are.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.080]   You know, and I feel like if I had the older version running
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.560]   on the current hardware, everything would be snappy,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.240]   but everything has just a little bit of a lag
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.920]   as I wait for, you know, all that stuff.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.480]   It's really cool technology,
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.200]   but sometimes I feel like it's not.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   - I'm funny that they haven't fixed that
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.600]   'cause that was something that bothered me
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.440]   with aperture one.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.200]   - But that's not, I had the same complaint with iPhoto.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.640]   I have the same complaint with garage.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   - Well, they're both, they're all written in Apple script.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.000]   - Well, they're all written in high level scripting language.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.720]   - Well, no, they're all the issue that I have
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.800]   is that they're taking full advantage
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.400]   of the computer that you have.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.320]   And on a big machine, they work really, really great,
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.480]   but on my laptop, sometimes I just feel like
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.840]   there's just this little tiny lag
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.000]   as it gets all the GPU stuff going that isn't, you know,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.240]   as snappy, it's crazy snappy when it's on my,
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.360]   you know, on a desktop machine.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.240]   It's just that on my laptop, you know,
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.520]   I find that it pushes the computer just a little harder
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.960]   than it's ready to go.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.120]   And, you know, and it keeps on scaling
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   with the new computers, which of course keeps us upgrading,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.240]   which is a good business model, but makes me a little crazy.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.080]   - Let's take a break.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   We're gonna come back talk more about Apple, Max, Flash.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.760]   And we'll also get your picks of the week in just a little bit
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.440]   and our audible pick of the week.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.880]   But right now I wanna talk a little bit about Citrix
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.000]   and the folks at GoToMeeting.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.320]   They want you to know that GoToMeeting is now available
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.560]   on the Mac, which is great news for Macintosh owners
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.160]   and lovers because GoToMeeting is the definitive
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.520]   meeting software.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.720]   And now you can use it on any machine you've got.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.240]   Try it right now by going to gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.040]   Before I'm done talking, you'll have it installed
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.680]   and then have a meeting.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.600]   Just have a meeting.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.040]   There's so many great places, you know, you can use this,
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.240]   not just for, you know, sales meetings.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.840]   Of course, I guess the first thing that leaves to mind
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.920]   is I wanna show you my keynote presentation.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.640]   So you'll buy my product.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.080]   It's great for that because your client doesn't have
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.920]   to have it pre-installed.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.680]   You just say, "Hey, we're on the phone.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.880]   "I'd like to show you this.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.800]   "Just go to GoToMeeting.com, press Join a Meeting.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.000]   "Here's the meeting idea in there in."
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.080]   Or you can even send them a link.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.800]   They're in that fast.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   You know, the installation is like 30 seconds.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.640]   That's quick, it's simple.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.400]   It's, there's no, you know, technical issues.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.920]   So that's really great for that.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.160]   But we also use it.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.320]   We use it more here for collaboration.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.440]   Whether it's Ray Maxwell showing us our desktops
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.080]   or working together with our sales team,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.360]   which is on the East Coast,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.400]   GoToMeeting is really incredibly useful.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.280]   Training as well.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.600]   If you've got a program that you can use
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   that you've got in your system,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.440]   you wanna teach somebody,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.280]   "I'm gonna do it with my sister.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.600]   "We're teaching her how to do our RSS feeds.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.960]   "I have feeder on my system.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.360]   "I'm gonna show her on my system."
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.200]   And then I could say,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.320]   "Okay Eva, take control of my system
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.160]   "and use the program.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.200]   "You don't even have to have it installed."
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.600]   I can go on and on, but I look,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.080]   I just want you to try it for free.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.920]   Save money, don't travel anymore.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.280]   Get more done, be more efficient.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.720]   It's a very affordable product
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.800]   and you could try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.640]   Includes by the way,
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.160]   voiceover IP and phone conferencing free.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.720]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.240]   G-O-T-O, meeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.800]   Go to meeting if you're not using it.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   You're not meeting.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.440]   All right, moving right along.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.680]   Adobe getting snarky.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.960]   Snarky.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.840]   No.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.240]   Snitty.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.560]   The Adobe Flash Play.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.000]   Now if you go to in Safari,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.720]   if you go to a site,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.040]   like get.dobie.com, you'll get this.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.560]   Oh, it's almost like Alex Trebek.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.960]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.240]   Flash Player's not available for your device.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.840]   See, Apple restricts the use of technologies
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.440]   required by products like Flash Player.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.720]   Until Apple eliminates these restrictions,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.840]   Adobe cannot provide Flash Player for the iPhone
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   or the iPod touch.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.120]   (laughing)
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.480]   That is mean.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.720]   That is like, mm.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.080]   This is an important issue for Adobe.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   I think we talked about this last week,
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.600]   but this is a,
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   if Apple keeps on going down this path,
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.800]   this is a real survival issue, I think, for Adobe.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.760]   They have to get Flash on the iPad.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.160]   Does this job take Adobe?
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.640]   Here's what I think.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.000]   My guess is, is that what jobs are people at Apple
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.680]   are concerned about is having a closed system
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.920]   that they are beholden to,
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.240]   that if it's not updated, they can't, you know,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.080]   they want as many,
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.200]   the only closed systems they want are their own.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.040]   You know, and so I mean, and I think that's their question.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.480]   - I wanna, okay, I'm gonna go a little contrarian on this
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.720]   'cause I think that there is a lot to be said
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   for holding the line here and saying,
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.920]   we are gonna support HTML5,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.600]   we are gonna support SVG and Canvas,
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.680]   we're gonna support an open way of doing everything
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.440]   you do with Flash right now,
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.920]   but we are not gonna support a proprietary product
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.280]   from a single provider,
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.560]   even though that's dominant all around the world
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.680]   that all these phones are coming out to support it.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.840]   You know, I just ordered a Nokia N900
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   that has basically Firefox and Flash 9 on this phone,
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.640]   but I actually respect Apple, and by the way, Google,
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.000]   'cause both of them are pushing HTML5.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.960]   - Right, and for their own business end of things,
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.880]   I think it's a really important,
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.120]   I think it's not-- - I think it's not--
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.440]   - Not be waiting for other updates,
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.160]   not be, you know, what Apple doesn't want, I think,
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.600]   is another Microsoft word.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.640]   You know, I mean, that's the,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.240]   that if it leaves the platform,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   or if it slows down, or whatever,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.040]   that was a huge issue when Steve Jobs came back.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.400]   Was it if Microsoft had pulled,
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.640]   right, Office, when Apple was--
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.760]   - That was the first thing Jobs did
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.280]   is went to Microsoft, said, please, sir--
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.120]   - Solve it. - Yeah, and I'll stay with us,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.280]   and then, and he got $150 million from Microsoft at the time.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.320]   I don't know why Microsoft,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.680]   way Apple needed money, but I guess they did at the time.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.040]   It was just an active faith, that's all.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.840]   - Yeah, but they kept Microsoft in the full--
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   - That was an important thing for five years.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.040]   - But at this point, they don't need to do that.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.960]   - They don't need to do that now,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.440]   but what they did is they slowly built their own system.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   So pages, and numbers, and all those things
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.240]   to make sure that they're not,
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.680]   have they done the same thing with Adobe?
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.200]   - Well, I think that the key, you know,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.920]   what they're doing is sand bagging flash.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.600]   I mean, there are companies who are now not developing
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.240]   as much on flash or at all in flash,
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.280]   because there's a growing iPhone market
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.760]   that is getting a full web browser,
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.280]   but they can't get to their pages.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.920]   And what's important is,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.680]   it's not just that it's a certain number of people.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.800]   It is the kind of consumer that buys an iPhone
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.720]   is a very valuable consumer,
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.480]   because they spend a lot of excess money
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.040]   on form and function and everything else.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.000]   Those are, they're worth more,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.520]   from a sales point of view,
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.080]   than people who are getting free little Motorola razors.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.240]   You know, they're just worth more to the,
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.480]   so the fact that they won't come to your website,
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.320]   they can't come to your website.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.160]   - It's a big deal now.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.720]   - It's a big deal and it's growing quickly.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.520]   - So there's pressure on Apple to give into Adobe.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.160]   - But I mean, Apple's-- - And the way Apple's--
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.160]   - There's a lot of pressure to do.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.000]   - I think Apple doesn't, I don't think out.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.040]   This Adobe's adding whatever pressure they can.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.920]   I don't think Apple's feeling any real pressure to do it.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.760]   - Really?
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.960]   They're not feeling pressure for people who run sites,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.320]   whose sites are not visible with the iPhone?
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.160]   - Apple will just tell them
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.640]   that you shouldn't build your site that way.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.160]   And there's not that many sites that have it.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.000]   There's not that many sites that have it.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.240]   - I think it's good that Apple has the,
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.400]   basically has an ally here with Google,
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.520]   is building into Chrome, is building Canvas,
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.400]   and HTML5, and SVG.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.440]   And there's moving very strongly towards HTML5.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.480]   I want to support Apple, 'cause I think that's open.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.320]   I think it's the right way to go.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.680]   - Well, I think that the hard part is--
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.200]   - I think there's some pressure to go to Flash,
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.480]   certainly from its users.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.320]   - I think that, I don't think that'll be enough pressure
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.480]   to get Apple to do it.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.840]   But I do think that, 'cause I don't think Apple,
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.480]   if Apple was still small, but as the iPhone continues
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.880]   to gather steam, it doesn't seem that it's affecting
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.200]   Apple's sales that they don't have Flash.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.480]   That's the problem, and the frustrating thing for me
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.640]   is that there are so many great things
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.680]   that Flash provides for, that these other technologies
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.520]   don't provide for you yet.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.840]   Maybe they will in the future.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.600]   But the level of interactivity that you can do,
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.760]   I know, I really think that interactivity
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.120]   is an important thing, and a lot of the things
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.160]   that we, the Hulu's and a lot of that stuff,
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.440]   there's a fit and finish that you get from those sites
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.680]   on a web experience that are very hard
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.840]   to produce in other ways.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.640]   And so Adobe is way ahead in that area,
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.600]   and I just hope that these other technologies can catch up.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   Andy, have you played with the Droid yet?
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.480]   I've had it for, I've had it since Friday.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.080]   What do you think I've played with one on this Sunday?
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.520]   Natalie Del Conny brought hers.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.720]   I was impressed.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.440]   I'm very, very impressed with it.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.600]   As a matter of fact, this is the,
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.080]   I test out a lot of different phones
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.760]   over the course of the course of the year.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.200]   And this is the first time that I liked something enough
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.920]   on the first day that I said,
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.120]   "Okay, I'm leaving the iPhone at home for an entire week.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.040]   I'm gonna rely on this phone entirely for everything.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.320]   So anytime there's something that I would normally do
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.720]   that is not on this phone,
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.640]   that's gonna force me to either figure out how to do it
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.280]   or download the software, I'm gonna need to do it."
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.240]   And you like to experiment on yourself, don't you,
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.720]   Andy? You're like Albert Hoffman taking his own acid.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.840]   You like, you just say,
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.160]   "I just gonna see how it feels."
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.520]   Sometimes, as with the Palm Prix, it's a bad trip,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.880]   but sometimes, I just like to be confident
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.480]   about the conclusions that I'm drawing.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.680]   - I agree, I think this is the right way to review something.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.520]   - I don't like to be enthusiastic about something,
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.760]   then find out two weeks later that,
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.960]   "Oh, wow, why did I not know that--"
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.800]   - No, with you.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.920]   - I can't say to this, but chiefly,
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.440]   it's that I like to learn new stuff.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.080]   And I also like, I had the same procedure
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.280]   when the iPhone came out,
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.760]   and I loved my Windows Mobile smartphone.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.640]   I thought it was a brilliant operating system
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.760]   for these cheap little phones.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.800]   It just don't have a touchscreen,
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.440]   they just have a five-way clicky interface.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.280]   I thought it was brilliant.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.600]   Like, it changed to it.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.880]   I was using it for about a year and a half,
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.920]   and it was a big part of my life.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.200]   But as soon as I got the iPhone,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.440]   that caused me to say, "Wow, there's something much better
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.720]   "than this, so I'm never gonna use this Windows Mobile phone
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.560]   "again."
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.600]   And so, my huge review was coming in the sun times
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.720]   in a couple of days, but obviously,
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.120]   I'm very, very pleased with this.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.000]   I think that, I don't know if I can say
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.720]   that it's better than an iPhone,
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.720]   but it's the first phone I've ever tried
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.440]   that I think is indefinitely, emphatically,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.800]   in the same class as an iPhone.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.240]   That's a big deal.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.440]   For people, there are people who will never get
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   beyond the need for one of these.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.720]   They absolutely must have a slide-out keyboard.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.080]   There are many people for whom AT&T is a deal-breaker.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.040]   And I feel as though, at the very, very minimum,
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.360]   the people for whom they refuse to use an iPhone
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.000]   because it doesn't have a keyboard
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.480]   and it doesn't have,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   I have to do covers through AT&T.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.440]   I think that they will be very, very, very, very happy with this,
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.720]   and they will, a year after a year of using this,
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.360]   they might think, well, why would I ever want an iPhone?
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.040]   How could, Gee, I'm moving someplace
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.240]   and there's no Verizon coverage.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.560]   Damn, I hate to have to switch to an iPhone
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.280]   because I love this thing so much.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.480]   - Verizon's taking the gloves off.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.920]   Have you seen this new, there's a map for that?
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.760]   - Yeah.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.640]   - If you wanna know why your 3G coverage
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.520]   was so much wireless, - Nice animations too, I like it.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.200]   - There's a map for that.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.760]   Or why you can watch videos at 3G speed, almost anywhere.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.080]   There's a map for that.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.840]   And if you wanna know why some people
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.120]   have a 3G coverage, there's a map for that too.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.200]   Yup, with five times more 3G coverage
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.280]   than the nation's number two wireless company,
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.960]   there's lots of reasons to switch the Verizon wireless.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.920]   - The map that they're showing is the coverage map
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.200]   for 3G coverage.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.760]   The map, there's a map for that, there's the Verizon map,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.720]   which is completely smoosh 3G coverage.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.920]   And then the AT&T map, which has these little sparse blue dots on them.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.360]   - Yeah, but it's not like,
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.320]   they haven't painted the entire state.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.600]   - Right. - I've spent the entire week
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.360]   with this and the iPhone in the same pocket
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.920]   and the same thing in the car.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.960]   And there's so many places where, just for a moment or two,
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.160]   I find that, well, I'm not getting 3G right here,
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.640]   I'm getting 3G over there, like another town over,
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.240]   but I'm not getting 3G right here.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.840]   So I'm not sure it's that big deal.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.320]   But as I tend to sort of formulate what I'm gonna be,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.080]   it takes me an hour to drive to see my dad.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.000]   And so I do a lot of like, just thinking about things
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.360]   I'm gonna write and I'm thinking,
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.640]   okay, I wanna address the map coverage
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.840]   because Verizon is definitely a wider spread network
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.840]   and it's a better network, but it's not as bad as all that.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.120]   And then of course, I get engine trouble and I'm on 995
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.240]   and I pull way off to the shoulder.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   And as if God was indicating his preference for the Android,
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.080]   God said, let's have him break down on a spot
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.760]   where there is no coverage of any kind on AT&T
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.320]   and he'll have to call AAA from the Verizon phone.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.640]   - Oh boy. - God, what?
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.480]   I will be done.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.600]   I think we have the lead for your article.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.760]   - That was, that's the other so dear.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.960]   I'm gonna have to talk about that, aren't I?
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.440]   (laughing)
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.280]   - Yeah.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   - No, I'm excited.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.360]   I've been waiting on the Droid.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.640]   I played with it a little bit.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.000]   It's not crazy about the industrial design
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.880]   'cause its corners are so sharp compared to the iPhone.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.760]   It's not quite as elegant.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.960]   - But that's okay.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.600]   It's definitely a premium phone.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.000]   It's very, very solid in your hand.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.840]   - It's good.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.680]   - And do that.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.600]   You feel as though it was actually designed to do that
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.840]   and that's the kind of thing.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.440]   - He's sliding open. - Yeah, the keyboard, yeah.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   - So if there are industrial design things that I don't like,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.720]   it's only that the single most important button
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.520]   on the iPhone and any of these buttons is the one
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   that you have to push in order to get it to wake up
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.800]   after it's been inside your pocket.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.640]   - Right.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.680]   - And on the iPhone, it is a huge button the size
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.560]   of an M&M right in the face of it.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.520]   On the Droid, it is roughly the size of a grain of rice.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.640]   It's way at the top there and it's sort of recessed
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.480]   behind something. - So do you need to think
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.320]   about that stuff, I don't understand.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.720]   - Yeah, I still haven't gotten the hang of that
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.040]   one fluid motion where I haven't activated by the time
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.520]   it actually reaches my attention.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.560]   - That's what Apple does so well.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.600]   I mean, they really work those, you know,
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.040]   for all the things you can say about Steve Jobs,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.440]   he's got good taste.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.520]   - Yeah, well, but then you'd think that companies
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.080]   would have learned by now that you just try the phone,
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.400]   do what Andy does, use it for a week.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.640]   That'd be the first thing they'd leap out.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.320]   Oh, it's too hard to turn on.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.440]   - Well, it's easy to make complaints like that,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.280]   but usually it comes down to things like,
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.700]   remember the time that we were all complaining
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:57.200]   that the original iPhone had a slightly recessed headphone jack.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.000]   So you couldn't just plug a headphone into it.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.160]   And then you find out that, well,
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.200]   that wasn't a style thing,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.040]   was because there was no way that they could get
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.700]   those rounded edges without the plastic
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.300]   they had on the back of this case would crack
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.280]   if they had it going flush and they didn't want
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.160]   to make it flat so they felt as though they had no choice.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.240]   I'm sure that when you talk about the difference
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.760]   between a thicker heavier device and nice rounded edges here,
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.640]   you're talking about, yeah, but guys, we had this nice,
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.140]   and felt design and we had it support the pull out keyboard
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.380]   and it kept breaking every time we kept testing it.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.640]   We're gonna have to make it thicker.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.700]   We're gonna have to make it chunkier.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.220]   It's gonna be uglier, but that's just what we're gonna have to do.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.180]   Although the big challenge I think is gonna happen
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.500]   in a couple of months when HTC, the guys who make this phone,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.940]   I'm sorry, Motorola makes the phone,
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.780]   but their Motorola is making a whole series of phones like this.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.980]   And one of them will come without a keyboard.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.620]   So when they're free of the need to have that sort of dual
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.440]   layer design like that, when they're able to make a phone
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.780]   that is just this, that's just this without the keyboard layer
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.600]   thin, boy, they can make some cool designs out of that.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.000]   - Sony's got an Android based phone that just came out.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.240]   I know a number of people are using that
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.240]   called the Xperia X10, but it's not running 2.0.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.160]   Do you notice a big improvement in Android 2.0
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.400]   over the G1?
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.080]   The one, well, the big improvement is just the fact
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.600]   that this has such a more powerful processor than the C1.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.220]   It's still not quite as good as Fluid as--
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.020]   back, thank you.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.220]   It's still not quite as fluid as what you would get
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.140]   on the iPhone, but it can sort of--
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.460]   one of the biggest tests is just the simple thing.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.860]   When I try to scroll, does it keep up with my finger,
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.860]   or do I have to?
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.020]   On the G1, it's plant, move the finger down,
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.860]   watch the thing scroll, then before it gets out of hand.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.540]   It's still not quite as fluid as the iPhone,
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.540]   but it's up there.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.180]   It's within the bounds of what the United States government
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:54.320]   would certify as suitable for human consumption.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.920]   No rat hairs.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.160]   I mean, the OS still needs some work.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.300]   I am the sort of guy who does worry
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:05.400]   about things like some of the finer points where
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.880]   it doesn't do multi-- it doesn't do multi-touch first squash
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.560]   and stretch, but when you want to zoom in on a website,
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.320]   for instance, I don't like the fact
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.040]   that here is an on screen--
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.520]   you can't really see it here, but here's
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.120]   an on screen magnifying glass.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.480]   Do I-- if I want to zoom in, do I touch the on screen
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.980]   magnifying glass, or do I touch the magnifying glass that's
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.500]   illuminated at the bottom of the screen here,
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.620]   that's part of the standard system button?
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.780]   Sometimes, the worst case-- the worst case situations,
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.640]   I actually counted-- there are three different icons presented
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.340]   to me with a magnifying glass on it.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.340]   Each one does a different thing.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.180]   Do I magnify?
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.420]   Do I do a search within this application,
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.980]   or do I do the Android search of the entire phone?
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.020]   That's something that Apple typically doesn't allow to happen.
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.940]   So--
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.260]   I will give you my review of the N900 when it comes,
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.580]   but I think that the key point-- the takeaway here
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.380]   is that the iPhone's getting some competition, finally.
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.540]   So some serious competition.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.020]   Again, if the iPhone did not exist,
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.940]   this would absolutely be my next smartphone, absolutely.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.700]   That's-- I'm thrilled to hear it,
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.980]   because it puts pressure on Apple to keep prices down
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.900]   and improve innovation.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.380]   I'm curious to see what happens in a week or two,
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.300]   which one you end up opting for.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.820]   That Verizon network is a better network.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.820]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.140]   Yeah, you have to agree with that.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.260]   The difference, though, is that people don't necessarily
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.820]   need to-- people don't care if there's great coverage in Utah.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.060]   They care if there's great coverage at their house,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.820]   at their work, in the place you can hang out.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.780]   It's got to be where you live, if that's what that is.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.980]   And also, keep in mind that, remember,
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.540]   when we travel to Asia, we could use our iPhones pretty much
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.900]   everywhere by spending an extra $100 for a special data plan.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.500]   This, I don't believe, has international phones.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:52.420]   So it's-- if you love your country more than you love,
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:54.180]   rest the world is perfectly fine.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:54.540]   But--
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.500]   Norway's asking an interesting question.
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.340]   According to 9-5, Mac, the reason there's not multi-touch--
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.620]   or perhaps the reason there's not multi-touch in the droid
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:06.140]   is a legal reason, not a technical reason.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:06.700]   Do you have any thoughts?
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.180]   Unknown.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.620]   I know that there's support for it
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.780]   within the operating system that, for some reason,
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.740]   there just doesn't exist inside this phone.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.100]   Oh, Pinch and Zoom is in the European version of the droid.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.620]   Right.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.180]   It is, again, it's part of a 2.0 operating system.
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.820]   It just does not exist right here.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.540]   I don't know.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.220]   So the hardware can do it.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:24.900]   Yes.
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.260]   I mean, the last thing is the hardware can do.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.740]   I was shocked to find that there is still no built-in Bluetooth
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.340]   profile support for keyboards, because if you wanted to just
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.380]   beat Apple over the head and face and then kick them down
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.060]   when they're down about something, it's, hey, look,
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.660]   why don't you buy yourself a really--
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.020]   buy Apple's really cool portable Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.020]   And you can use this almost as a regular netbook.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.060]   You can't do that with the iPhone.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.500]   Technically, you can do that with the Android,
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.980]   and there are hacks to make those happen.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.700]   But there's still no official support
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   for that within the operating system, which is surprising to me.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.820]   I completely agree.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.780]   I mean, there are so many times when I would not
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.340]   be taking my computer if I just had a keyboard.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:01.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.580]   I mean, and I hope that when Apple does the Islay or iPad
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.900]   or whatever it is that we get--
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.220]   because it literally would be most of the time,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.140]   I just can't answer all of my email that way.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.580]   I can't write things that I need to write.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.460]   I mean, I would love to be able to take this thing out
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:16.060]   and just work on it.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.460]   That's what attracted me to the 900.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.020]   It's got a real keyboard and a real screen resolution.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.540]   So you're getting--
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:26.020]   you know, it's 3 1/2 inches, but I think it's 480--
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.220]   what is the resolution?
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:30.140]   I mean, you're starting to get 800 by 480.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:31.620]   So that's almost a computer.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.140]   Right.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.820]   You know, and that's really, really close
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.740]   with a real keyboard.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.540]   And if I could choose, I mean, I don't need the keyboard
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:38.900]   all the time.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.620]   That's why I think that there's such an opportunity
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.140]   for the Islay or iPad or whatever,
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.700]   is that I don't need the--
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.540]   When you want it.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.940]   But when I want it, I want to have it, you know?
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.660]   I'm really interested in this 900.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.420]   And I think the Droid, the 900, some other interesting phones
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.500]   are going to really give Apple a run for their money.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.340]   I think that's good.
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:57.980]   We'll get a better phone.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.300]   We'll get a better device.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:55:59.940]   Somebody--
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.340]   Speaking of things, Burs and Steve Jobs saddle.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.900]   It must have pained Steve to walk into an Apple Store
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.620]   and watching the clerks using Windows CE-based devices
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.100]   to bring you up.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.780]   Apparently, Apple has finally created an easy pay retail store
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.940]   checkout system based on the iPod touch.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.900]   So now, soon, the Apple Store employees
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:25.420]   will be carrying these iPod touch bases.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.220]   Pretty heavy duty.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.660]   I mean, it's a lot thicker because it
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:30.580]   has to have a radio transmitter on it and so forth.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.020]   Barcode scanner, hidden rechargeable battery
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.100]   to power the auxiliary hardware.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.620]   You can sign.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:38.540]   There will be a stylus.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.380]   So you can sign on the iPod touch.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:45.380]   You can swipe your cards in a separate terminal.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.980]   But as is currently happening in stores,
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.380]   you don't have to go to the cash register in the Apple Store.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.220]   I think it's one of the things they did really well.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.260]   You can buy from the clerk and they're going to use finally.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.100]   Now, this looks like a mockup because it says iPhone.
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.340]   So I don't think this is the real thing.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.620]   They're going to use the iPod touch.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.100]   What if they're going to be actually
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.820]   selling these to enterprise?
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.100]   Yeah, but that's a good product, don't you think?
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.700]   It's a really slick solution.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.220]   Work so great in the Apple Store is
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.460]   that you wonder if there's a business plan to say,
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.260]   you know what?
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.260]   Let's sell this to the gap.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.220]   Let's sell this to Best Buy.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.660]   Let's basically make this the POS.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.420]   Why not?
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.100]   And you don't mean it-- when you say POS,
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.060]   you mean it in the best way.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.060]   I'm about to say.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.580]   I mean, point of view to say it.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:30.020]   This is the default POS.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.020]   All right.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.820]   One more story, and then we're going to get to our picks
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.660]   of the week.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:42.580]   For September, book-related apps overtook games
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.340]   in the iPhone Store.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.780]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.140]   We're talking about the Kindle and how we'd like to--
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.660]   It's not sales, by the way.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.740]   It's new releases.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:51.220]   Right.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.420]   So don't-- I mean, I'm sure games are still out selling
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:53.900]   everything else.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:59.300]   According to a post by media analytics--
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:04.580]   mobile analytics company, Flurry, that book-related apps
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.140]   saw an upsurge and launches in September.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.580]   So much so that book-related applications overtook games
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.780]   in the app store as a percentage of all-released apps.
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.060]   Oh, it's not just new releases.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.700]   It's of all-released apps.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.660]   In October, one out of every five new applications launching
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.740]   on the iPhone was a book.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.020]   Wow.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:21.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.980]   That's a very big deal.
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:26.620]   Also, we have an announcement last week from Marvel Comics
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.420]   saying that they're putting a lot of their titles available,
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.140]   not specifically through the iTunes Store,
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:35.780]   but they made deals with the most popular online services,
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.060]   like Comixology, Iverse, and Panelfly,
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.620]   that if you can buy-- you can get these little book apps
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.980]   through iTunes and do the iTunes Store
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.580]   and through those apps buy individual Marvel Comics.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.660]   And it has the same limitations that they
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.420]   have with their usual online initiative.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.060]   But the fact that the iPhone has become so closely targeted
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.540]   as a reader app, that's very significant.
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.780]   It shows I was wrong when I said, oh, nobody's
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   going to want a slate, nobody's going to want an iPad,
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.700]   because who would want such a thing?
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.940]   If people are reading on their iPhone--
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:09.860]   Ooh.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.540]   I mean, because that's not the ideal reading platform.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.340]   No, that's--
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.460]   I find that I read a lot on that.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.740]   I mean, I didn't think I did--
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.020]   I read a lot of web pages.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:18.340]   But I got to--
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.260]   Well, I read a lot of web pages.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:20.820]   But you know what I do is I use Instapaper,
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.220]   and I say Save this, Save this.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.380]   If you use Instapaper, it's great,
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.340]   because it'll accumulate-- maybe you told me about this,
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:26.820]   Andy.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.340]   It'll accumulate a certain number of things,
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.740]   and then send it to your Kindle once a week,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.660]   so that you have this stuff to read.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.820]   There's a profound movement to disconnect the content
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.060]   from the actual medium that you're reading it on.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.300]   Someone on one of the message boards said something that
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.220]   was so good that I'm going to have to pretend that I came up
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.020]   with it myself.
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.620]   That the difference between these two--
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.100]   old technology, the new ones--
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.300]   is you have to ask yourself, do you like books,
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.780]   or do you like reading?
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.380]   Because it's OK to say that I like books.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.500]   But if you like reading, then you definitely
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.060]   want a solution that allows you to have your entire library
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.660]   on this little tiny slate device.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.820]   And just if you did not bring your Kindle or your whatever
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.180]   with you, decide, you know what?
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.380]   I'm going to press two buttons on this device,
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.620]   contact amazon.com and say, you know that book I bought
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.460]   three weeks ago?
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.620]   Please send another copy of it to this right now,
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.820]   and then fast forward me to the last page
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.060]   that I read on the Kindle.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.180]   That's something that anybody who likes to read
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.260]   is definitely going to get behind.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.100]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.660]   I think that this feature of--
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.140]   do you use that Instapaper feature?
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.380]   I use Instapaper, and I also use--
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.660]   Stanza has a really cool feature where if you just give it
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.780]   a URL, it will download the text of that URL
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.380]   and convert it into a much slicker e-book
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.620]   than Instapaper does.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.180]   Right.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.820]   Oh, really?
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.340]   So I have to try that.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.180]   That's another pick.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.340]   All right, let's get to our picks of the week in just a second,
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.420]   but first I want to remind everybody, of course,
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.620]   that Audible provides this show, makes it possible,
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.580]   foots the bill, pays for the hot dogs for the staff,
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:04.180]   the whole deal, and so my friends, if you believe,
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.220]   if you love what you hear on this show,
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.460]   you must support us by getting an Audible subscription.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.820]   I'm trying a new guilt-based advertising technology.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.820]   You're watching a lot of PBS.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.260]   I have a shame-based advertising.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.260]   Shame-based.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.260]   How would you do that?
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.180]   We keep on talking about Audible.com.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:18.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:23.820]   And if you're listening and you haven't downloaded a free book,
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.500]   you're crazy.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.140]   It's free.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.700]   It's free.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.220]   It's free.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.100]   Why wouldn't you?
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:28.860]   That's all I got.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.940]   Is that shame or blame?
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.740]   Silly.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.980]   Silly.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.380]   Sillyness.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.660]   You're must be a silly person.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:35.380]   Why wouldn't you--
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.180]   It's just silly heart.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.540]   Why wouldn't you just go right now to audible.com/makebreak
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.900]   and get a free book?
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.540]   Who's-- what's stopping you?
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.860]   Probably they don't know what to get.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.900]   They don't know what to start.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.820]   I think the guilt's better than the shame.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.140]   But both have been tried and true
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.820]   by public radio and television for many, many years.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.340]   I think we need to give them some guidance.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.740]   I'm sure we can talk to an expert about what they should
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.420]   download.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:58.940]   If they're--
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.140]   But you know, what would be a good expert?
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.740]   Let me think.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.620]   Oh, Andy and I, Co.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.020]   How about he seems to listen to a lot of audio books.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:09.620]   I'm still listening to your movie recommendation.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.500]   Loving Easy Riders at Raging Bowls.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.060]   And that's one where I've gone to a Roku and gotten
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.220]   a lot of the movies.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.460]   Not all, but a lot of the movies.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.220]   It's been really fun.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.700]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, the only truly painful thing
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.980]   about having to rely--
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.220]   I'm relying on the Android also exclusively
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.500]   for all my audio, too.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.180]   And I find out--
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.060]   I only discover how addicted I am to audio books.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.380]   When I realize that I cannot find an audible.com player
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.620]   for Android, it's coming, but it's not here yet.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.300]   And so I'm just at that really great point
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:49.700]   of the unabridged memoir of Ted Kennedy, where now we're
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.380]   very, very close to 2004, 2005.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.980]   It's in the Clinton administration.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.820]   And you know that we're getting to the end of the book,
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.540]   where he--
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.260]   Anyway, and I've had to pause on that for an entire week.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.300]   I can't.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.900]   People sometimes ask me, well, why isn't it on this platform?
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.060]   Or why is it not on Android?
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.740]   And it is not audible that develops these players
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.140]   for the various platforms.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.420]   They do provide an SDK and a lot of support
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:16.340]   and help for Apple or Creative or iRiver, whoever it is.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.260]   It's making the devices.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.660]   But it's ultimately up to that company
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:23.460]   to make the support, because Amazon owns Audible.com.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.620]   It was on the Kindle from day one.
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.700]   And it's up to Google or a third party,
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.940]   I suppose, who could make an audible player on Android.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.700]   And it's not a million different players.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.020]   So you know that's an absolute amount of effort from Audible.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.300]   No, Audible really--
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.220]   I was asking him at the time, why isn't it on the Zoom?
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.300]   And they said, look, we have tried.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:40.820]   We have tried.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.140]   We go to Microsoft every week.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.220]   We say, how can we help you?
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.540]   How can we facilitate this?
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.180]   But it's not them.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.340]   It's the platform that has to do it.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:52.780]   And so it's just a matter of getting Google to write
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.020]   to your congressman or your member of Google,
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.300]   write to your member of Google and say,
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.380]   make Audible work on Android.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.100]   Meanwhile, you got to pick for us?
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.020]   I got to pick for you.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.260]   This is a book that I haven't started yet.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.220]   I have read the first chapter of it via Kindle.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.300]   That's often how I preview an audiobook.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.020]   But the next book I'm going to spend my next credit on
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.260]   is a book by Ross King called The Judgment of Paris,
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.380]   the Revolutionary Decade that gave the world impressionism.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.220]   Oh, what fun.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.980]   It's exactly the sort of-- from the description
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.860]   and from the first chapter, it's exactly the sort of book
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.940]   that I'm really into.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:35.340]   It takes you into 1850s Paris, and follows the lives
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.820]   of two different artists, one of whom
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.300]   is Ernest Miss Le Nier, who at the time
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.540]   was the most popular and most sought-after artists of the time.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.100]   Because you've never heard of him now.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.060]   Nobody has heard of right now.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.860]   And Edward Monet, who was absolutely hated and despised
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.740]   and thought to be an absolute hack and an idiot.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:58.300]   And so it's sort of a sallierry sort of Mozart sort of thing
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:02.100]   of where the guy who is the absolute titan of his time
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.820]   but utterly forgotten versus the guy who was showing us
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.180]   what the next thing was going to be like,
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.100]   but no one else really understood it.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.060]   But on top of everything else, it uses these two guys
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.740]   and their lives to tell you all about what society was
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.500]   like at that time.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.620]   I think most of us have heard the story about when
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.500]   Stravinsky premiered The Ride of Spring.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.820]   And the stories all say that during the premiere,
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:23.900]   it just caused riots.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.260]   People were tearing up streets, tearing up seats,
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.820]   and throwing them.
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.660]   They were so offended and sensed by it.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.420]   And you're like, dude, it's classical music.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.380]   It's not-- it's not--
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.380]   Oh, dude, he's ruined the canon.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.380]   Exactly.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.780]   It's not, you know, whatever.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.580]   And so you try to figure out if you have this very, very
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.580]   pleasant, pleasant classic painting of three
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.980]   four people picnicking in full suits by the water.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.460]   And one of these people is a woman
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.980]   and she happened to be naked, but not in a vulgar way.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.420]   Why would that just get people so--
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.620]   oh my god, Captain Spolding.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.140]   Jesus.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   And so the dude--
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:02.940]   Exactly.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.420]   It's like nudity hadn't been invented until 1958.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.380]   And even then, just by accident.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.540]   But yeah, it's-- so it gives you a good--
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.140]   not only about the history of art,
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.260]   not only about two very, very interesting lives,
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.260]   but also a very, very interesting time.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.500]   We can't really relate to 1850s Paris.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.380]   I can't relate to 1850s or Paris,
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.540]   but this, I think this-- from the first chapter that I read,
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.940]   I think it's really going to be a good deal for me.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.980]   And it also has two really good features to it.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.660]   Not all books on Audible are available in both
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.260]   abridged and unabridged editions.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.380]   I tend to go for the unabridged because I've
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.820]   got the-- I've subscribed to Audible Listener Gold.
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.060]   I get a free book every single--
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.300]   excuse me, I get a prepaid book every month.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.660]   Whether the book costs $800 or $8, it's cost the same thing.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:47.140]   That's a good deal.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:47.980]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:49.140]   But there are a lot of people who don't want
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.740]   to be in for a 14-hour and 46-minute audiobook.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.500]   But if you want to just sort of dip into it,
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.060]   get the shorter version, the shorter version is available.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.700]   Right.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.220]   Great.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.020]   So this looks really good.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:04.140]   Our Audible pick from courtesy of Andy Inako--
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.340]   and it sounds really good-- the judgment of Paris,
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.900]   the revolutionary decade that gave the world impressionism
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   by Ross King.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.940]   But now, understand, this is not a requirement.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.220]   You could get any book that Audible publishes.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.380]   You get a credit towards any book just
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.860]   by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.860]   And we like to pick some so that you
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.780]   can have somewhere to start a starting point.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.940]   But boy, there's all sorts of great stuff in fiction,
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.900]   non-fiction history, humor.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.180]   It just goes on and on.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.580]   I love Audible.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.100]   I can't-- wouldn't dream of getting in my car
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.660]   or going to the gym or getting on an airplane
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.300]   or doing housework or whatever, hundreds of things
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.420]   that I can't hold a book without my Audible--
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.020]   without my iPhone in my Audible book.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.620]   And I know you're going to love it too.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.860]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.460]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.700]   This just in from Engadget.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:59.700]   Apple rejects Macworld's iPhone super guide
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.980]   because it contains the word--
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.860]   iPhone.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:03.820]   Oh, iPhone.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260]   Oh, man.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.940]   [GASP]
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.380]   OK, Apple, I'm officially going to buy one of these phones
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.340]   just to punish you for being idiots.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.900]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.820]   How do you write an iPhone super guide without using
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.500]   the word iPhone?
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.620]   I think the CEO is Lewis Carroll now,
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:24.940]   and I'm not Steve Jobs.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.780]   That is just bizarre.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.500]   I mean, I guess for the same reason,
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.900]   they would reject your book.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.220]   Is it-- iPhone fully loaded?
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.860]   Fully loaded for pre-order, but please don't give Apple ideas.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.020]   I need the money.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:46.700]   It's just an iPhone reference manual.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.580]   How do you do it?
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:48.340]   I started.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:51.820]   It started out that we wear a jello for that.
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.180]   Pick off your shoes.
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.740]   They are illegally out of the land of fudge.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.780]   By the way, this is coming from Jason Snell
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.740]   who's the editor-in-chief of Macworld in his Twitter.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.420]   He typed it all in caps because he was so incensed.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.540]   Our book about the iPhone has been rejected from the App Store
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:10.580]   because it contains the word iPhone.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.740]   However, David Pogues iPhone, the missing manual,
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.100]   is available in the iPhone App Store.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.780]   Oh, man.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.300]   Pays to be Pogue.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:20.940]   There's a word for that.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.300]   It's called, I think, capricious.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.300]   Capricious!
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.060]   That's really the bottom line.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.580]   It's not because it's David Pogues
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.860]   because it's a different guy on a different day
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.820]   who had a sandwich before he reviewed.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.380]   And he was in a good mood and he said, OK.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.340]   That's a good book.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.100]   Nuts.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.660]   All right, time for our picks of the week.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:40.020]   I'm going to start with the Mr. Expensive here.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.340]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.740]   I'm going cheap.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:43.780]   You are?
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:44.780]   I'm throwing you a curve.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.780]   I'm going expensive.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.580]   I'm going free.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.580]   Free.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.660]   Free.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.700]   This is an app that came out while we were on the show.
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.100]   This is how desperate you are.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.100]   No, no, no.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.940]   I got an email from them.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.900]   And so a bunch of our blogs are on Squarespace.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:02.820]   Oh, is it here?
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.220]   It's--
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.500]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.660]   So the Squarespace app is finally out.
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:12.220]   They have released an iPhone app that is a model for--
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.780]   it just literally came live while we were on the show.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.860]   And so it's in the iTunes store.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.660]   It's just the Squarespace.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.460]   It's the free download.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.260]   And what it lets you do is manage your Squarespace account.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.260]   So if you have a blog or if you have your site or whatever,
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.020]   you can manage this from your iPhone.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.540]   And it's not just going on the web and managing it.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.300]   And it's not using something else.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:37.700]   It is an app that is built wired in for Squarespace.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.980]   And you can preview your blog.
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.780]   You can add blogs.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.620]   You can add pictures.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.060]   You can manage the account.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.940]   You can see how many people are going to your site.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:46.900]   It's got the stats in it.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:47.700]   It's got the statistic.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.500]   Look, there's a little page view.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.220]   I got page view.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.980]   Subscribers, searches, refers.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.820]   So all of that stuff is being run here.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.740]   And it works great.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.180]   You can just type it right in, but you
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.220]   could post a photo from your album.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:03.940]   I can type in.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.260]   I can post photos.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:05.900]   I can--
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.900]   It's--
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.380]   you know, I can--
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.060]   and because I have a bunch of different Squarespace accounts,
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:12.940]   we have a bunch of different site--
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.100]   So you have multiple accounts in here?
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.180]   I can have multiple accounts.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.660]   And I can make different ones active.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.180]   I can jump between them all.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:19.260]   And there's nothing wrong.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.140]   There's an iBlogger.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.060]   There's a bunch of good ones that are great that interface
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:22.780]   with Squarespace.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.980]   But there's nothing like having a site--
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.100]   having one that's built.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:26.980]   Oh, it's free too.
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:27.420]   For it.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.980]   And it's free.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:34.140]   And so if you're a Squarespace fan, which I am,
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:34.460]   I would--
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:34.820]   That's great.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.580]   --highly suggest it.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.980]   And by the way, they're not sitting on their laurels.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:41.140]   They say they know you want comment approval.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.100]   And version 1.1 is on its way to Apple already
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.140]   to add that feature.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.220]   So moderation of comments.
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.660]   And it's just great to be able to be mobile and manage that.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.620]   Oh, I think that's--
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.140]   I think I actually might start posting.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:57.700]   Yeah, there's one-- it's easy enough to get a blog.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.140]   It's a whole other thing to--
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:11:59.900]   Keep it going.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.700]   --keep it going to actually put stuff in there.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.300]   But that's going to make a big difference for me.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:04.820]   Good.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.300]   It's good.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:05.640]   Good pick.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.020]   Squarespace.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.940]   Just search for Squarespace and iTunes.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:11.100]   And you'll find it.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.100]   Annie, that go your next?
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:18.500]   Yes, my pick is related to the droid, but not of the droid.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.540]   There is certainly a religious connotation to that.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.260]   Like I said, I liked this so much that I decided
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.660]   that I was going to just use it as my regular thing,
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.660]   including--
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.420]   I spend so much time in the car sometimes
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.740]   that it's my standard music player,
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.260]   whatever device I'm using in the car
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.620]   to listen to my podcasts and stuff.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:42.220]   And so the step number 1 to this campaign of making this do
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.820]   everything that the iPhone does for me
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.380]   was going to be I need to move my iTunes--
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.780]   sync those two iTunes.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.700]   Now, a few weeks ago, I recommended
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.500]   a really cool open source project that
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.100]   is designed to be sort of like a platform and device
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.660]   unspecific version of iTunes.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.340]   And it's a very, very nice application.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.500]   But there is a much, much better solution.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.060]   If all you want to do is you want to keep iTunes,
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.860]   but you want to be able to seamlessly sync content onto a
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.500]   phone that is not an iPhone, our friends--
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.020]   our friend Jonas Soling at Soling Software has an
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.980]   incredibly cool piece of software called Soling Media Sync
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.540]   that works exactly.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.100]   It turns almost any phone that you can mention into
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:26.220]   essentially an iPhone as far as iTunes is concerned.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.780]   So long as that phone has the ability to mount on the
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.020]   desktop as a mass storage device, and just about everything
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.220]   that is not an iPhone has that ability, it's a very, very
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:34.780]   quick setup.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.620]   You simply, just as you do in iTunes, you tell it what
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.620]   playlist that from iTunes you want to sync onto this device.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.500]   You can include videos.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.660]   You can include photos from Aperture and iPhoto.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.940]   And then by clicking a couple of buttons, you can set it up
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:51.660]   so that the moment that this device appears on the USB bus,
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.620]   it will-- the Soling Media Sync will automatically simply
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.020]   connect to the device, sync all your stuff, and then--
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.180]   So great.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:00.540]   This is--
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.740]   And when I get this from my N900, it's going to solve my
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.740]   N900?
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.460]   Yeah, it's absolutely perfect.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.100]   It works completely in the background.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.700]   It's a little icon in the menu bar that tells you what it's
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.060]   up to.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.820]   And also, if you want to adjust settings, you can adjust
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.460]   them through the menu.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.420]   But it is simply plug it in as soon as it shows up.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.220]   Soling software finds it, syncs it, and you're done just
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.700]   like if, as if you had an iPhone attached.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.540]   And also, he has such an absolutely awesome demo wear
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.540]   policy.
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.620]   It's the exact same software where you pay for it or not.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.540]   If you pay for it, I believe it costs something like $22.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.580]   Chicken feed.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.100]   But both versions of it will work perfectly fine.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:40.300]   The only difference is that if you don't pay for it, it
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.500]   will simply copy all the contents of all these playlists
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.460]   onto the device every single time.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.140]   Once you pay the registration fee, it will intelligently
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.980]   figure out what's already on the device and simply remove
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.020]   stuff that's no--
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.300]   remove and it will do a smart sync.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.580]   So instead of taking three hours to copy 15 gigabytes
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.580]   worth of content onto the phone, now we'll just take 18 minutes
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.220]   to copy just the 100 things that just appeared within the past day.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:06.740]   Wow.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.740]   This is really great.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.460]   Perfect.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.020]   iTunes songs and photos.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.140]   Of course, nothing with DRM in it.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.340]   Obviously, nothing with DRM.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.060]   But a wide variety of things work on it.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.060]   Unfortunately, my favorite video podcast,
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.780]   Robert LeWillend's Carpool, does not work with the built-in
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.220]   players.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:26.060]   It uses a different kind of H.264 encoding, I believe.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.260]   But another cool thing about the media sync software
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.580]   is that if there's a form of media that will not
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.940]   work on this device, it will say, sorry, we couldn't
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.780]   add this to the library because it is possibly of--
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.100]   I think I'm misspeaking.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.380]   I think it understands what a certain phone is capable of saying
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.180]   and warns you that--
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.900]   Oh, you can't do this.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.820]   I've copied it over, but it probably
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.340]   will not play for the following reasons.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:48.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.140]   I am going to make a pick that you probably already know about.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:54.580]   But we don't mention it enough.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.660]   And I really am grateful to Houdini7 and Shift key software
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.020]   for making this app for your iPhone.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.700]   And I think from time to time, I know it's a little self-serving.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.380]   I would like to plug our own TWIT application on the iPhone.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.220]   If you have an iPhone, you can use this application.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.300]   It's absolutely free to listen to the audio of our shows.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:18.180]   We stream audio from our studios 24/7.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.580]   And this app will work on Edge or 3G to give you the audio.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.220]   But more than that, it has the calendar for our shows,
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.100]   so you never miss a show.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.180]   It has some really kind of funny features.
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:32.260]   You could download video from ODTV.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.620]   And I'm sure we'll update that once we start offering
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.100]   our own high quality video.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.860]   A link to all the other TWIT properties.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.060]   My favorite feature, though, is it's
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.380]   got a button on it to call Leo.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.300]   You press the phone button.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.140]   It'll die on my radio show, even if I'm not there.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.620]   So a very simple tool, but a free one.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:55.020]   And I think it does a great job of making it possible to listen
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:59.860]   to everything we do, including this show, on your iPhone 24/7.
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.580]   It is free.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.060]   It is just called TWIT.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.940]   And I think Shift key software.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.900]   And Houdini7, who wrote this for us,
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.060]   and I encourage you to take a look at it.
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.300]   And then somebody in the chat room saying,
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.220]   I accidentally pressed that button and called Leo.
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:17.140]   I didn't intend to do it.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.700]   And they're like, ah, well, I was going to--
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.540]   well, whoops.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.140]   That's all right.
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.380]   I would love to hear from you.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:24.900]   I don't care.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.860]   You say, hey, I pressed the button.
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.780]   I just pressed the button, my accent.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.460]   Thank Andy and I go for being here.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.340]   He is, of course, with the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.380]   Look for his droid review in the next couple of days
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:37.700]   in the esteemed Chicago Sun Times, the best paper
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.220]   in the second city, the windy city, the city of broad shoulders.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:44.340]   Hog butcher to the world.
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.100]   That's copyrighted.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:45.860]   Be careful.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.140]   Is it really?
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.100]   It probably is.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.140]   Probably can't say it.
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.900]   And since the city of Chicago is so litigious,
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.580]   I will just shut up now.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.660]   He is also online at cwob.com.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.500]   You'll find Alex Lindsay online at pixelcore.com.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.820]   That's his wonderful guild of multimedia artists
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.180]   who both learn together and get work together.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.860]   And of course, pixelcore.tv is where
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.260]   all of their great podcast exists,
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.900]   including their video Macbreak, the companion piece
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.460]   to this show, which is a much watch video program.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:23.660]   And also, we're going to be doing more live feeds.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.900]   We've been starting to play with live feeds of us doing production.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.460]   So people are actually interested in watching
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.180]   some green screen productions and steady cams
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.700]   and motion control cameras.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.660]   Just follow my Twitter.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.820]   So it's just Alex Lindsay.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.300]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:35.500]   Because I'll just Twitter when we're doing it.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.820]   Fun to watch a little informal.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.740]   We're getting ready to do a lot more of that
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.140]   as part of the pixelcore.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:42.820]   But right now, we're just playing with it.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:46.740]   So I'll just be posting on Twitter when we're doing it.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.860]   So check that out.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:52.340]   I should also mention, as long as I'm mentioning phone applications,
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.540]   that there is a MediaFly application for the Palm
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:00.100]   Pre and for your Droid or for any Android phone that is available
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.460]   from the folks at MediaFly.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.540]   That currently has audio on it.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.340]   But we'll have video and streaming video as well as soon
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.500]   as that is available, which we--
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.420]   I hate to say any date.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.580]   But we think we'll be very soon.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.820]   We now-- we currently are editing video versions
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.180]   of all of our shows.
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.820]   We do that at the same time as we edit audio.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.020]   So it's kind of a part of the process.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.100]   We are uploading them.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:24.980]   We are posting them.
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.060]   We are making them available.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.300]   But you just don't have the player quite yet.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.620]   But any day now, any day now, you're
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.220]   going to have the player on your Roku, your popcorn hour.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:38.020]   But you can get the player right now from MediaFly.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.980]   It's in the Palm Pre store.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:42.420]   It is also in the Android store.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.380]   Just look for MediaFly.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.380]   And we are on there, along with all your other podcasts.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.260]   It's a very good podcast client.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:50.980]   So I should mention that's another thing you can do.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:53.420]   And I think this is still good.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.300]   There's a text-- you could text "Twit" to a short number
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.900]   on your pre or your Android.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.860]   You should try this, Andy.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.740]   And you can get an OTA download link automatically
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.380]   texted to you.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:12.580]   That is text the word "Twit" to 30364.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:21.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, back to work.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.180]   Break time is over!
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:26.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.420]   (upbeat music)
