[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Joining us today, we're so glad to have him back on the show.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   He finally is out of book hell for at least the moment.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Good morning.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   For the morning, anyway, Merlin Mann, 43folders.com, top 5s, and of course,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   the fantastic podcast It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes, we were very proud of our work. Thank you.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You look nice today, which was the inspiration, obviously, for you.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's always sunny in Philadelphia.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's good to see you, Mr. MacBreak.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's nice to see you guys. Thanks for having me.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yeah. Scott's still working for the paper factory, but he's in a new division.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Scott is in a very interesting new division at the paper factory.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He's doing good work.

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   He did the lonely sandwich like, does Vegas or something?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   What was that that he did?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Something like that, anyway.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   There's Andy Inako's laugh to save me just in time.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He's chortling away, of course, from the Chicago Sun times,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and the celestial waste of bandwidth, and a host of MacBreak Weekly since day one.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Is it since day one?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Who was there?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   There was a well before you didn't have like that,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   you're improved matting on the tables and chairs yet.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Once that studio was set up that way, then I was right on board.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Basically, all liquids bounce off now.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And that's what we like.

[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I've got my ladies' version, the Diet Coke in hand.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm sorry.

[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Do you think there's really Coke in those glasses?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I don't think so.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I really don't.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   In fact, with Simon Cowell, I was pretty sure it was vodka.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Hello.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Hello.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Off his travels.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It was a wild one.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You were in London last time we talked about it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I was in London, Paris, and Amsterdam last week.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Wow.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yes, so we were shooting, we shot for Salesforce on Wednesday last week,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and then we went to Paris and did an interview,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and then we went to Amsterdam for IBC, which is kind of like the NAB of Europe.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And then we went to the Heineken bar and learned how to pour Heineken's,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and we practiced a lot, and then we crawled back to the hotel and got a flight home.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Love it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Did you carry with you any ninja throwing stars, just out of curiosity?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So when I was younger in a different part of my past, I used to carry a ninja throwing star in my wallet.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Me too.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   What?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You too, Merlin Man?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Oh, yes, small one.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I had six inch ones, and I had the three inch ones.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   What?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I had four points, and then I had the great 8.1s, and I had a--
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I had a fat I missed where you were prepared to toss this.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's called being a man, Leo.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Look at him.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I had the 6.1s, the 4.1s were kind of hard to land, but I had to get the stick.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Do you guys also carry multi-tools, gurbers with you at all times?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Are you stupid?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So Steve Jobs is apparently a man, according to SPAA magazine.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I'm not sure what the-- SPAA magazine, SPA exclamation mark.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.720]   Aww, magazine says, "Steve Jobs will never return to Japan after officials at an airport
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   barred him from taking ninja throwing stars aboard his private plane."
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Security scan at Kansai International Airport near Osaka.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Detective of the weapons inside the executive's carrying on luggage.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Do they really-- if you're flying private, do they still scan your luggage?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I think it depends on which airport you're going out of.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I guess-- I guess, well, I guess Terris could fly G6s.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I don't know why you'd want to, but--
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Anyway, he was returning home from a family vacation in Kyoto.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   SPAA is a Japanese magazine apparently, so that's why it's like that exclamation mark.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   "Siting unidentified officials at the airport in the Transportation Ministry,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Jobs said it wouldn't make sense for a person to try to hijack his own plane.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Then, Toto officials, he will never visit Japan again."
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Apple says, "What?"
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   That's okay, it's not a big technology town.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Apple says, "What? What are you talking about?"
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And he's telling a spokesman for Apple says, "Steve did visit Japan this summer
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   for a vacation in Kyoto, but the incidents described at the airport are pure fiction.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Steve had a great time and hopes to visit Japan again soon."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Now, the only way we're going to know which one is true is when we see Steve visit Japan again.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Right.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   If he never visits Japan or doesn't do it for the next couple years--
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Because Steve says, "I'm not going back here. I would say I would take him as word."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I mean, he's not the kind of guy-- he's a grudge holder.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah, nobody watches video on a phone.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Nobody would ever want to read a book on an LCD device.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   No, but I mean, like he says-- I think he does this.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I think he's into these red-haired--
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I will never--
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Well, you're going to put-- I will never go back to Japan in that category.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It could be thrown a tantrum. You could be mad.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah, I've said that. I've said that.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It could be a faint. It could be a business faint.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It could be something where, you know, maybe he's just-- it's a deception, right?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Maybe.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Although, you got to rewind back that statement that it didn't--
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   it didn't imply that it wasn't butterfly knives, say, or nunchucks.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   No, it could have been nunchucks.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Or not nunchucks.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Well, actually, we don't call them throwing stars.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We call them Shuriken.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   However--
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Well, I bet you get much better ones in Japan than you get here.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Because the ones here kind of stamped--
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It wasn't for him who was for the kids.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Well, yeah, I mean, you know--
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I'm sure it wasn't for him.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's always for the kids.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Just for the children.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Just for the children.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Just like Jerry Lewis and the telethog.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It's for the kids.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I mean, they're not hardened here.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   They're stamped.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   They're bare--
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   when it's embedded in an inch's head, whether it was stamped or hardened.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It makes a difference when you're sharpening them.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Sharpening is like--
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   As you lay down, you'd like to think that they made an effort,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   that this cost them.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   They don't get this back.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's going to cost them $14 this dark and it's not.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Then you got to run up.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You got to pull it out of the guy's brain.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's like a--
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's like a difference between scallops, right?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   There's the real scallops and there's the scallops that cut out
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   of like a big piece of a ray.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Same thing here.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   The shuriken that you get in the United States are very--
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   they're really crummy and they don't keep an edge, right, Alex?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Well, that's the real problem because they haven't been folded.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   The ones you get in Japan, that steel has been folded 20 or 30 times.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It's kind of disgusting.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It is like a Damascus.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's like a shunn.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It is.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Except that it's a shuriken.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And you're only going to--
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Oh, shuriken is that how we pronounce it?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's what I call them.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   When I grew up, we call them shuriken.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   It's like Sukiaki is shuriken.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Shuriken.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   How does the story like this happen?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Well, because Takeshi Uno, a spokesman at the consai airport,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   said yes, a passenger using a private jet was stopped at the end of July for carrying shuriken.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And the passenger whom Uno--
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   too many fouls, whom Uno declined to identify because of the airport's privacy policy
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   threw away the blade.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So clearly these weren't Damascus steel.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I think it's safe to assume that any time somebody in a private plane is detained in Japan,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   it's probably Steve Jobs.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I think so.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Or John Lennon.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And since Lennon's done longer with us.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Oh, it's McCartney, right?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   What are you talking about the week?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Was it McCartney?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   No, I think Lennon too.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Was it McCartney or was it Lennon?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   19, 1970, '90.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Just don't do that in UAE.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He'd be in jail for life.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's a weird story.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   That's a weird story, Leo.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I don't know how something like that comes up.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   That's true.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You think it's true?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Well, it came up because you bookmarked it.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Do you think it's true?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He's like one of those cheesy tech crunch kind of headlines.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It is a kind of a tech crunch headline, isn't it?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Steve Jobs.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Is Steve Jobs trying to kill people in Japan?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   He's actually in the next series.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   This is the new form of aspiring to have Mark for Death by Steve Jobs.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's right.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   What was he said to assassinate him?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Why did he carry them?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   All of a sudden, the black turtleneck makes perfect sense.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   He is a ninja.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   He was trained.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   This would be the new form of a full body set.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   The jeans just cover up the black booties and stuff.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Ooh.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Based on some stories I've heard about meetings with him, I could see him being a nunchuck guy.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I've got to be honest.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I could see him taking a bitch out with a nunchuck.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   No question.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Can we raise the tone of conversation a little?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So I really, I should have led with that story because now nothing we say.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Well, we can dispose of it quickly and it's a good way to start the day.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It is a good way to start the day.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Coming up more news, but first, let me talk about hover.com.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We just got to get the flavor of that story out of our mouths.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   This is a little sorbet exactly in between the stories.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Just a little break to freshen the palette.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Hover.com is a great site.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And this is, I have a special deal.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Actually, we're going to take off the deal that I have on the screen right now because this is a special deal.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   If you go to Macbreak.hover.com, it's only for Macbreak Weekly audience members.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I should explain hover.com as domain registrar.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   They've been around for a long time. You may know them as the name domains direct.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   They're a division of two cows and they're great guys.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I use them and recommend it.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   In fact, as soon as they started up, we transferred all of our domains over from that other one.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   The other one.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Yomama, I think it's called. Everything we transferred out.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Mostly because hover is not, you know, I saw Yomama's up for sale, you know.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Well, all I can say is that managing domains in Yomama is a pain in them.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's painful.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Yomama. And they're up for sale. They say they'll get over a billion dollars.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And you know why? Because they make $100 million a year on those secondary services that they sell you.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's the upsell that drives me.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's the gauntlet that's the order.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You just want to buy something.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And then there's like eight clicks of, "You can't find the next button."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So this is not hover.com. Hover.com focuses on making it easy to register and manage domains and email.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   They have a no hold policy for customer service calls Monday through Friday, 9am to 8pm eastern.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You're going to get a hold of a human. And they won't put you on hold.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Now, one of the names that they want to give you, this is the deal for today.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Do you have First Name Last Name? AlexLenzie.com?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I do. But I did it a long time ago.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Yeah. See, I can't get Leo Laporta.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   It's a good thing to get now.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I did get it for my kids. When you have children.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Has Leo Laporta. Well, somebody, not me.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   It's a big jerky jerk who ruined everything for everyone.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   It's okay. But I did get First Name Last Name for my kids, Abby Laporta and Henry Laporta.com.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Some years ago, and I got like a 10-year registration on it.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You know, it was like a hundred bucks because I wanted to keep it.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And then when they hit 21, I want to hand it over to them.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's like, it's like, some of the people got a million dollars.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Some people got a car.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I don't show build upon this domain, but my air. My sky.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I thought, you know, they would be grateful.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Daddy, it's much better than the Ford Focus.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Yeah. You were going to give us a Fiesta, but instead you gave us a domain name.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   It's really nice to have First Name Last Name.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You don't even have to have a website because you could set up with Hover to say,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "Go to your Facebook page or your LinkedIn profile or your Flickr page or your Twitter page."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Whatever it is. But the thing is, you can redirect it at any time.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So, you know, a lot of people, in fact, my kids say this.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   "Oh, we don't need Abby Laporta.com. I've got Facebook."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Even if you just point it to your Facebook page, that's the deal.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   You could make a livestream out of it. Start a blog if you don't have one yet.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Now, they have .com.net and .me.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   They suggest you look for .com and .net first, but .me is also out there.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Use the code Mac break. You'll get 10% off.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And if you use .me as an extension, use the code Mac break,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   and you'll get $5 a year for the first year.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So, this is a really great deal.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Just for Hover users who listen to Mac break weekly, please don't tell those schmucks who listen to Windows weekly.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   This isn't for them.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Use the offer code Macbreak, either say,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   "10% off or .com or .net," or $5 for a .me.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And we do thank Hover so much for supporting the interface.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's so clean. It's so simple.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's so simple.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It's like, "Just give me the -- I just want the domain."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   They don't do hosting. They do do an email redirection if you want to do that.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So, that's another good reason.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   If you have Alex at AlexLindsay.com, that's a nice thing to have.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I couldn't get Leo Laport in 2000 or '99, I tried to.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   - Wow. - Someone really got ahead of that.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Somebody got way ahead of it, and that's why it's Leoville.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   - Right. - Because I couldn't get Leo Laport.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   - And if you're listening and you have Leo Laport.com, stop being a jerky jerk.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   - No, it's not right. - At this point, I would --
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's just sitting there. It's empty. I looked at it.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   - It is empty.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Whoever's holding it is being empty.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   - I look for that. I look for Leo Laport.me.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Somebody's got that.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And I wanted Leo.me, it would be cool.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But you know what's weird if you go Leo at Leo.me.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   So, Leo at Leoville. That's okay. Yeah.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Merlin, do you have Merlinman.com?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, see, you're smart.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You knew.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   - You were adaptive path back when the Internet started.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   - Oh, I was just with them briefly doing freelance stuff.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But my first domain name I ever bought was a .new,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   because it was just really easy to buy. It was kind of costly.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   But yeah, then I got into the domain buying thing.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And kids, if I can just talk you out of that.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   - How many domains? How many do you have?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   - Well, I -- - Probably a lot of them.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   - Labs, right?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   - Well, I -- yeah, I've let some go.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I've let -- yeah, some of them were really just --
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   - Do you have Shuriken.com?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   - No, that sounds good.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   - You should buy -- I will buy them literally for one joke.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And then I'll forget that they're all --
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   - [ Laughter ]
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   - And then I have 180 domains, and that's no good.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   - You know, Dick D. Bartolo does that, too.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   In fact, he has a domain that he bought --
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   - I should know what Leo, can I just say,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   that should be in the DSM-5 for ADD.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   That should be one of the --
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   - Yeah, you buy a domain.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   - If you're not a domain name, it's the diagnostic.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   - Joe, you should get help. That should be --
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   - Yeah, you're ADD. If you have more than 20 domain names,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   you're ADD.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   - Oh, I was ADD a long time ago then.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   - Yeah.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   - Dick registered "Mary Christmas from Dick D. Bartolo,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Mads, Madist, Writer, and the Gizwiz.com."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   - And then he posted his Christmas --
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   he put his Christmas card on it.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   This was a couple of years ago, and he sent everybody the link.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   - You know, the best -- Can I tell you the best one I own?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I think you might have looked like this before.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   "Cash Duke 777 double what money supply income use 78.com.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   - You don't really have that, do you?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   - And what do you use that for?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   - It's a single video I made as a parody,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and I bought "Cash Duke 777 double what what?"
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   "Money supply income money use 78.com.com."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   - Is it still good?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   - When the dot com is at DOT com?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   - Oh, yeah, no, it's one of the --
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   it's like that McSweeney's joke.com.com.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I think it's still up.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Let me check.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   - I don't even know how I would open it.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   - I just sent it to you.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I just sent it to you.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   - Oh, that's so fun.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   - You know, we need -- Do you have the rat home music?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   - Yeah.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   - By now, we've exceeded the rat home.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   - I just realized I missed it.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   - That's why I'm using Merlin.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   - There you are.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   - Such a deal for this ad.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   My God.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   We're not still in hover, are we?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Are we still in hover mode?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   - I don't know what the name is.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   - Markets are conversations, Leo.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   - Markets are conversations, he says.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Mr. Clue Train here.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   - Ha ha ha ha.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   - Anyway, so also on "Cuckoo's Rat Home."
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   - We had to do it because Merlin was here.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   We go through many rat holes, but we can't define them as rat holes because part of the
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   definition of rat hole is a rat hole when Merlin is here.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   - I'm trying so hard, you guys.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I'm trying so hard.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   - We love it, that's the best part.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   That's the best part of it.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   We're not complaining.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We're just celebrating it.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   - We're celebrating it.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   - Let's celebrate it.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   - Let's celebrate it.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   - The kids don't like it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   The kids want the hot apple content and I apologize.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   - You're not.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   - Not always.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   - I'd cool your apple content and I apologize for that.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   - I think they love the entertainment.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.800]   - So apparently on the configuration, I've been waiting for this day.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.000]   On the configuration of Build Your Own on a Build Your Own iMac or Mac.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   - Comes with a jet engine.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   - They've got the 27 inch cinema display is in the list now.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So you can't, I don't know what happens if you order it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Because I didn't actually have the nerve to order it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   But I really want the 27 cinema display.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Rumor is it'll be under a thousand.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   799 after the 24, writer 699, 699.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   - So go into 27.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   - Oh, and it's a denser pixel.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   It's just, it's the same width, I believe.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   - Oh, right.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   - As the 30 inch as far as the number of pixels.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   - It's just wide screen.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   - So it's just, wide screen.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   - Dense.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   - I keep, I've been checking, because they said September.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So I've been checking every day this month.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   - And that's got the camera built in.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's got the camera.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   - You like the smaller form factor and the density of the, I'm going to get the terminology
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   wrong, but the denser retina like display of it is, you get the same amount of stuff just
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   in a smaller footprint and it just looks better.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   - I like that.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   - Mm hmm.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   - I like that.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   - I like that.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   - It's got the guys.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   - I like my 30 inch, but it's a monster.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   - I like 30 in exactly.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's big.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   - It's a big monitor.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   - It's a big monitor.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   - The other thing, unlike the 30, these new ones are like the 24 where if you have a laptop,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   it has a USB connector, a MagSafe connector, and a mini DisplayPort connector, three little
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   connectors coming off the back, you plug them in, you don't even open the laptop, you just
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   plug them in and now you have a desktop.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So I bought the Magic Trackpad, I have the Bluetooth keyboard, I just need the 27 and
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   then when I put my i7, I have a pretty high end MacBook Pro.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   That'll be really a nice sweet setup.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   - Yeah.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   - I'm really looking forward to that, but I'm still looking because I see in the store it
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   is not yet.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   - These are smaller screens make a lot more sense, so a 13 inch or 15 inch.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.480]   Like you want the real estate at home at seven, like the big real estate at home, but you
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.320]   want to be able to travel like my, we have when we travel for these shoots, we have
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.800]   two 17 inches in my 13 inch that we carry around and which gets a lot of attention and
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.520]   security, but my brother was stuck with the 17 on the way back from Amscur to everybody's
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.000]   like, yeah, I can't open it more than about 45 degrees.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   My little 13 inch opens really nicely.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.720]   So you want to have that 13 inch for when you're traveling, but when you get home, you want
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.120]   the big screen real estate and having it be able to be easy and just able to pop it in
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   is the key to the operation.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.040]   - It's funny because we got one for you because you were using the office, we got the 24.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.880]   And for the longest time we were trying to figure out how do you keep the thing, how do you
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   keep the laptop on?
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   You know, he had it open.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   - Yeah.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   - And we finally figured out, you just plug it in.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.880]   - Just plug it in.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.880]   - Just plug it in.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.880]   - Just plug it in.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   - Silly boy.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.200]   - So Steve Jobs has rewritten the rules and I'm curious what you guys think.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.920]   The iOS development restrictions are now changed.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.400]   They're going to allow third party tools and third party ad services.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:26.120]   And they finally published the actual guidelines for getting into the store.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.720]   This is the first time they've ever even published guidelines for the store.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.880]   - I think this was a conversation with Apple's lawyers.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.360]   - Because the EFTC investigation.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.440]   - I think they're asking a lot of questions.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.920]   This is going to get ugly and it's better for us to be proactive rather than be forced
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.240]   by the courts where we don't have control.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.080]   The risk is too high, whether we think we can win or not is on the point if we lose.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.400]   And the courts make a decision.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.320]   This is going to get ugly because they don't really know what they're doing.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.920]   - I think that's what they're afraid of.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.680]   - I think you just really saw the precise palatability factor that I think Apple was
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.280]   willing to fight a PR battle over these policies, but they weren't willing to fight a legal
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.280]   battle over it.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   That's as simple as that.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.200]   - And it wasn't like they committed themselves to that much specific stuff.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.760]   What they really did in some ways.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.000]   - So you're talking about the review guidelines.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.240]   We're saying this first part, well, I think there's two things.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.080]   - The ability to use Adobe flash frames to write out.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   - Just to open up the developments saying that all the code does not have to be objectively
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   compiled.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   - Right.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   - Exactly.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.160]   You can do really, this is just this is chiefly a nod to not only Adobe's action, but also
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.560]   the ability, the clarifications of the game developers would not have to worry about using
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.600]   different frameworks and different APIs in order to get something working on their own
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   platforms.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.680]   - You know, so they did reserve, you cannot download, your app cannot download and execute
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.800]   any external code during operation.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.920]   So that does put the blocker on any idea of Adobe developing a flash app that is just
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:56.280]   sort of like a handoff app so they could still load web games and web flash content
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.920]   because that would still not be legal under the idea.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.360]   - And in Apple's defense, that would also be a big security hole.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360]   - Right.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.480]   - I'm just curious to say that whatever you can get into a C library is fair game.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   I mean, where's the line?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.240]   Because for example, this was going to be one of my picks, but--
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.040]   - No, you had to use the official Apple SDK.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   You could not.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   - It could not.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.880]   - Yeah, before, this has changed, but before you had to use the libraries provided by Apple
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   and no other.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.320]   - Yeah, you had to build the next code or you--
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.080]   - And you couldn't use third party libraries.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.880]   You couldn't just say I'm going to use it right.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.800]   - The specific example I'm thinking of is, I mean, I'm a huge markdown nerd.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.560]   I write everything in markdown.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.280]   And I've gone so far as to basically try and cobble together my own web app for making
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   this easy to do on the fly.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.400]   But the fact is you can't run Perl, you can't run PHP, you can't take any of the basic--
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   - Right.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.800]   - The main ways that either John or the people who did it afterward have done it.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.640]   But this new app calls on-- I believe it's called discount-- is a markdown library in
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.320]   C. And so it's able to do this basically.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.880]   You get this great thing now where it's designed to be-- you write HTML-- excuse me, you write
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.760]   markdown and then email it, but I just use it to write markdown.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.400]   The point of my point is that there's so much stuff that I wish I could do through things
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.040]   like text expander that actually do require shell type, you know, units, capabilities.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.080]   I wonder how much-- what kind of stuff could you jam into a C library that might route around
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   some of these limitations?
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.560]   - I'm not-- maybe there's a developer in the chat room who could talk about this because
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560]   you're right.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.840]   I mean, why couldn't you just write a library and compile it in next code and then you'd
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.960]   have the capability?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   How restrictive is Apple?
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.600]   - I think that's-- - I mean, it's certainly-- it opens up a lot of doors.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.400]   I'm talking completely out of my butt.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.200]   - No, but you should be able to link to a C library.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.600]   - Yeah, yeah, but I mean, it's certainly open up a lot of functionality and it potentially
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.800]   keeps things more stable, right?
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.880]   It's compiled, it's done, and you don't have all this wildcat stuff going on with pulling
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   this crap off the web.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.680]   - Our chat room, Keith says, and Brig says you can, in fact, link to a third-party library.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:59.200]   So-- well, I think that one of the things that I'm going to want to know as a user is I
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.520]   would really like things to be certified one way or the other.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.760]   If they're developed natively in Xcode, I'd like to know that what I'm buying is developed
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.240]   natively or it's not native.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.320]   And the reason that's important is because I've already had experience with Skype as native,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.560]   but I can tell you right now that I barely open up Skype on my phone because I know it's
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.520]   going to drain my battery into the ground.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.720]   And so if I'm going to have stuff that is going to be not necessarily play as well in
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.800]   the OS as other things, I think it behooves Apple to say, "Yeah, you can develop for it,
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.840]   but we're going to put a little certified Xcode, whatever that we know is going to play well
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.200]   in the system."
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.640]   I think that makes sense for Apple because I think that they just need to let people
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.640]   know.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.640]   And then if I want to buy the app anyway, it's fine.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.040]   If I want that functionality, but I just need to know.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.440]   - We've talked about before, which was the idea of having a vetted app store and then
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   an open app store.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.520]   Of course, if you jailbreak, you've got city and the other app stores, but wouldn't it
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.360]   be nice if Apple made that choice?
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   And by the way, going in the other direction, it'd be really nice if Android had a vetted
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.040]   store, not a vetted store.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.000]   There's word that Verizon's going to do an app store.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.720]   Maybe that'll be a little bit better vetted.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.880]   - Verizon for the Android.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   - For the Android.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.640]   - But see, I think this is the real challenge that Android has is people starting to build
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.400]   lots of different app stores, thousands, I mean, not thousands, but tens of different
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.640]   flavors of Android, which apps work where, you know, I think this is going to be the
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.200]   thing that is going to make Android a real mess if they don't figure out how to get some
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.360]   kind of control over it.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.960]   - Well, they won't.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.760]   - They can't, because it's open.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760]   And so they can't.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.200]   This is the problem Google has is that anybody can use Android for free on any device, whether
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.680]   or not it has the right screen resolution, the right capabilities.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   You can do it.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   - Right.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   And the restrictions.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.440]   - It's more the restrictions that the different phone companies are putting on the different
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   Android phones.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.360]   It just means that, you know, as that grows, I think that's going to be a real difficult
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.880]   challenge for Android to grow past the, you know, kind of the geek and semi-geek culture.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   - By the way, I have to--
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   - Go ahead to Andy.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.960]   - I was just going to say that's a key problem.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.160]   I've got the Droid 2 here that's running a Froyo 2.2.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.960]   And as soon as I got my first 2.2 Android device, the first thing I checked was the camera
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.760]   app, because I have an XS1 that gets the build direct from Google.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   - Right.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.120]   - And the Google version of the camera app is wonderful.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   It fixes every problem that I didn't like about the first version.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.920]   But of course, you get the Verizon version and they're free to put their own version of
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   it.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.760]   And all the really cool features that I like in the Froyo edition are now absent.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.520]   I still have to like tap through three different menus to just to get a plus one exposure or
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   change the white balance.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.280]   So that's the problem that Android has--
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.080]   - Of course, because it's open, you can change that because you can put your own ROMs on
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080]   there and everything.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   - Yeah, it should not be--
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   - But it's a pain in the butt.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   I agree with you.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.200]   And I think, but you know what, this is called the world of cell phones, which suck.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.000]   And the advantage Apple has is they have one carrier and they can write the rules for
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   that carrier.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.720]   As soon as they open it up to another carrier or two, they're going to have the same problem
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.680]   which is the carriers and that do--
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.200]   Of course, Apple's still also the one manufacturer.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.440]   This is the advantage Macs have, right?
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.040]   One source, one manufacturer.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   It's both an advantage and a disadvantage.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.480]   - It's one of the reasons that we stopped doing a lot of our development for our software
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.480]   on a PC side.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.680]   Now, we're looking at maybe doing that in very limited quantities again, but the problem
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.520]   was we had to test it against 27 machines.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.360]   It was like, it was just huge.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.240]   Like, it was like, we had all these people that we'd send our software out to make sure
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.000]   that it worked on all these different flavors on a Mac.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.080]   We would like-- there were two or three different flavors that we'd check out and we knew it
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   worked.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.960]   I got my regular email from my inside source at Verizon and I have some surprising news
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.120]   for you and we'll get to that in a second.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   But I do want to--
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   - Cas, you asked a question?
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   - Sure.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:34.280]   - I guess we'll probably get to the iTunes store, the changes to their acceptability policy
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.040]   stuff too, but I just curious, in general, with all of these changes-- I might be jumping
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.760]   ahead here-- but who do you think for whom does this make the most difference in terms
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.600]   of deciding whether or not to develop for this platform?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.520]   Who is either going to-- who's going to either hear this and go, "Okay, that's-- sorry,
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.440]   that's definitely not enough for me to invest in this."
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.320]   Or who's going to hear this and say, "Okay, I'm satisfied."
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   Because there's folks out there--
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   - No, it's--
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   - You think--
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.720]   - I think it's game developers because a lot of the frameworks that make games work
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.040]   are scripting platforms and those are specifically prohibited by the terms of Apple's author.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   - You use the big one.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   - Exactly.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.640]   And so this suddenly means that no, there's nothing prohibiting you from doing that.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.440]   Essentially, Apple has done-- Apple has explicitly stated that, "Come on, you know what we mean
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   about scripts."
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.440]   - Right.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.720]   - But apparently you didn't, so we're going to say explicitly fine.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   - Right.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   - Here's what we want.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   - So the game--
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.520]   - We're in agreement though that they said yes to this because of pressure, legal pressure.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.520]   - I think this has--
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.280]   - I think this is way more about legal issues than it is about trying to build more developers.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.800]   - Developers did not-- I mean, I don't think developers were able to convince Apple of
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   this.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   The FTC was able to convince Apple.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.360]   - Yeah, I think that that's absolutely the case.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.640]   I mean, I don't think that-- I don't think Apple needs more-- I mean, when you talk to
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:50.040]   developers, there are ROI on developing versus Android versus iPhone generally is much higher
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   on the iPhone.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   And so the draw is really--
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.040]   - You don't think that Apple's--
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.640]   - If it makes it-- if it makes it out of the store, but go read the story about briefs.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   - Right.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   - But curl your hair.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   - Right.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   - It's staggering.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.920]   I mean, it's-- of all these examples that are out there, the one-- what that poor guy went
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.640]   through is just-- it's just sad.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   - Can tell a story.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Tell us a story.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   Tell us a story.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   - Oh, this is just a-- you know, a story that's gone around and I'm not the first question
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.720]   report this, but there's a really interesting app called Briefs.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.680]   And the notion is you could basically doodle a UI, long hand, and long story short, you
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:24.080]   develop a working prototype of an app on your phone very, very quickly, which is hugely
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   helpful.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   I mean, there's apps like this.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:31.560]   I have one of my iPad called iMocups that makes it easy to basically do wireframes for
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   a website.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.880]   But the guy who did Briefs, anyway, you can read the story yourself, but essentially--
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   - Rob Ryan, this is his name, R-H-Y-N-E.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.200]   - What a lysi, and from every report, he sounds like this super nice guy.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   He's got a new kid.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.600]   He put all the stuff right into this app, and I don't want to misstate the facts, but
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   it's my understanding that he has done nothing but play ball.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.240]   At every level, he's not gone out and dised Apple.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:59.200]   He tried really hard to just play by the rules, and it sounds-- to use an overused
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.120]   adjective, it sounds perfectly Kafkaesque, his experience of this, where, you know, he
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.360]   even had people on the inside trying to help him.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.440]   And, you know, it was like whacking at a nonexistent pinata.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.360]   He just kept trying and trying to see his efforts.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.240]   And I don't know, I mean, nothing going around, but I mean, it's just like-- it's a lot of
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   effort.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.840]   If it's not a game, you're just grabbing some library and putting some graphics in.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.040]   There's a lot of work in making one of these apps.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.520]   - He's open-sourced at this point.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.520]   - He finally--
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.520]   - He has.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.840]   He's thrown in the towel and said, "Hey, go enjoy it."
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.120]   So anyway, I just-- I'm just curious, because, yeah, sure, I mean, for right now, they've
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   got the lead.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.320]   They are the go-to place for this, but they're not going to have that forever.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.840]   And if they want to bring people in, if they really want this to explode to the next 10
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.520]   X level, they're going to have to do a lot more than say, "We don't want fart apps."
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.080]   They're going to have to do something that really demonstrates that you can trust this
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.040]   process with your business.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.520]   It's not just a joke.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.760]   - I think that the thing that I've noticed with Apple is that they're very focused on
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:03.800]   what I call 90-90, which is what will 90% of the people want 90% of the time, you know?
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:11.960]   That is where-- so if you go into the 10/10 area, there's not a lot of support.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.360]   And I find that there's not a lot of commitment to supporting that area.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.800]   And I think I used to complain about it a lot, and I still complain about it, and I get upset
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.440]   and I go, "Oh, I'm going to go get an Android."
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.080]   But I realize that that model has been really successful for them, is to really focus on
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.120]   what will 90% of people do 90% of the time.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.520]   - I think what you're describing is actually really smart.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.240]   It's a variation on the Pareto principle.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:38.000]   And it is really smart because it says that there's a very large number of significant
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.640]   data that comes out or significant stuff that comes out of a relatively small minority
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.720]   of stuff, or in your case, a large minority of stuff.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   And I'm not saying that.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.360]   I'm just saying that it's difficult to know when someone doesn't do something in life.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.080]   It's very difficult to know when somebody stops looking at your website or when somebody
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   stops.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.520]   So it's hard for them to probably know how much opportunity they're leaving on the table
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.880]   by not taking this as seriously as any other business would.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.640]   - I think releasing the guidelines is a very important step.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   They should have done it before, but they've done it now.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   - Start.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.360]   - And they were surprisingly candid.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.160]   - I'm just saying they already have good information, good metrics coming back.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.280]   The fact that they have the largest app library anywhere, the most profitable app library
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.920]   anywhere, that doesn't mean that their decisions are correct.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.800]   But if you ask someone who's in charge of these decisions, is this the right decision
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.000]   to make, they will point to these numbers and say that well, clearly, we can't make
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   everybody happy.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.120]   We're not saying that our guidelines will work great for everybody, but clearly we're
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.320]   providing a service that is working for both us as Apple, both Apple for developers and
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.480]   for the users.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.040]   So I got into a discussion with us a few months ago with somebody who was saying, I was at
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.120]   a conference, they're like, oh, I can't believe that anybody would want to publish through
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120]   the Apple store.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.680]   They're so restrictive, anti-freedom.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:58.200]   And my response is the same now as it was then, that you have the freedom to not do business
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.360]   through the Apple store.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.480]   Apple will continue, the person who Apple will suffer if they're making the wrong call.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.360]   If Android can do it better, if HP can do it better through the WebOS store, that's
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.000]   a huge opportunity for those people.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.080]   That's why 2011 is going to be a very important series of battles.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.640]   Apple will continue doing what they're doing until it stops working for them.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.960]   - Yeah, well, that's when they get the metric, but is it timely?
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   I guess the question.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.200]   - Yeah, well, again, they're making money handover fast, they've continued to grow.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.920]   - But also, I've been fairness, Andy, that's not really what I was saying.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.120]   And I mean, I ticked the point that there are.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   - I'm so stoked.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.280]   - Yeah, but I agree with both of you guys that it's really easy to go over the edge and
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.760]   get all emo about this.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.200]   And in fact, a lot of people who got really emo about this eventually said, hey, look,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.760]   the truth is in order for me to play this game, I'm going to just have to accept this thing
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.960]   that I don't like.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.440]   And that's how life works.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.920]   I'm saying something a little bit different, which is that, and it may not be significant.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   It doesn't matter.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   Maybe they'll always be on top.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.840]   Maybe they'll never have to worry about competing.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.160]   But that lead will diminish in one way or another.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:05.240]   And it certainly doesn't hurt to show the people who are developing for your platform
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.520]   that you take them seriously.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.720]   And you have to look no further than the world of open source to see that is true.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.480]   Developers will leave, well, I'm just going to say someone thought.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.040]   - Okay, well, that was a lot to reference.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.560]   Developers will leave the platform that they feel, and they're like, rasply thinking of
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   sinking ship, right?
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.120]   We've seen this over the years.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.760]   They're going to go where the other developers are and where the users are.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.840]   So I'm not even making a case for freedom.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.600]   I'm making a case for Apple to have a kind of sustainability that goes way beyond the
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.120]   people who are interested in Apple.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   Now, to the giant companies that might want to make something that becomes a real earner,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.640]   not a 99 cent fart app, but more of the $500 apps that nobody's going to go develop.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.080]   - I think that's two years gone.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.520]   If you look at these guidelines, I have to say I was impressed by the kind of the informality
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.320]   and the candor of these.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   For instance, we have lots of kids downloading lots of apps and parental controls don't work
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.000]   unless the parents set them up.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Many don't.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.280]   So no, we're keeping an eye out for the kids.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   You think Steve wrote these, Myrtle?
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   I think you implied.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   - Well, that was Groobers.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.040]   I think that, well, I don't know if it was Groobers who originally said that, but I first
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.120]   saw the link there and he said that.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.240]   If you read that, it's very informal.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   We have over 250,000, oh, the first line of the whole thing.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   - What's the very first line?
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.160]   - In real, do you want to invest your talents in time to develop applications for iOS?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.840]   It has been a rewarding experience, both professionally and financially.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   - Sorry.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   I was listening for the line.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.480]   The one line where he goes, "Dada, dada, something's something we don't need anymore."
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   - Fart apps.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.840]   Yeah, it's not the first line.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.720]   - Also the line, the idea that if you play this out, if you fight this fight in public,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.880]   that's not going to help anybody.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.680]   - Yeah, don't try tracking us in public.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   - That was huge.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   - Right.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.880]   It says, "We will reject apps for any content or behavior we believe is over the line.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.880]   What line?"
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.040]   Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, "I'll know it when I see it and we think that
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.120]   you will also know it when you cross it."
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.920]   Look, somebody, some C-level executive wrote this.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.480]   This is not a marketing guy.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.280]   This is not a developer that wrote this.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.000]   This is somebody with a lot of power and confidence.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.080]   If your app looks like it was cobbled together in a few days or you're trying to get your
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:08.120]   first practice app into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.840]   We have a lot of serious developers who don't want their quality apps to be surrounded by
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.320]   amateur hour.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.160]   Steve's used that phrase amateur hour before.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.960]   I think that might be a telling phrase.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.920]   - It's, I mean, I want to really just bracket.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:26.800]   My desire for them to have more complete and exhaustive and unambiguous guidelines has nothing
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.120]   to do with the fact that I think that was brilliant.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.520]   I think it was brilliant to put that plainly.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.520]   Google's trying to do a similar thing.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.720]   I don't know if they're succeeding as well with their privacy stuff, but everywhere you
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.120]   turn, there is so much unapologetic BS in business.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.520]   People constantly speak to you and they say untrue things all the time and not like we
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.520]   can't tell.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.200]   Even if they're going to say, "Hey, look, you know what?
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.400]   We're not going to tell you everything.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.240]   We're not going to agree to everything, but what we do tell you is going to sound like
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   us."
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   - I really admire it.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.160]   - I know there was a voice in this, which I thought was quite good.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.680]   I mean, I'm trying to find that fart.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.440]   It's right at the very top.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.600]   It's in the first section.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   - Is it?
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   - It's like the four-year pair of rifu.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.120]   - We have over 250,000 apps in the app store.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.440]   We don't need any more fart apps.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.000]   If your app doesn't do something useful or provide some form of lasting entertainment,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.840]   it may not be accepted.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.840]   I mean, it's not as...
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.200]   - If you go down below, there's some very concrete things.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.640]   Apps that are beta, demo, trial, or test versions will be rejected.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.160]   Apps that launch or install other executable code will be rejected.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.000]   I mean, they're very clear.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.440]   - That's something like...
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.800]   I'm not so contradictory, but the line...
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   There's one line in there.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.520]   I don't have this in front of me, but the one line in there is like two lines that were
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   interesting.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.000]   One was that I think they say something along the lines of if there's a lot of apps that
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.840]   do what you do, you're more likely to be rejected.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:52.360]   The more costly your app is, the more scrutinized it'll be, both of which on the face of it
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   absolutely makes sense.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:02.280]   But that's a very dynamic, slippery, changeable, evolving thing that's not...
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.200]   And again, I just want to stipulate.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.080]   I think they're brilliant from their own reasons to not end themselves down.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.400]   - Why didn't they publish this before is my question.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.320]   This is something that should have been published on day one, don't you think?
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   - But I think...
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.280]   - No, because they needed two years for the sample data before they could figure out.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   Here's one.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   - It is not.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.000]   - Because I really think that it is a case of them looking at apps and saying, "Instinctively,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.360]   I think this is right for the App Store.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.600]   Instinctively, I know this is not right for the App Store."
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.880]   And it takes a couple of years for them to say, "Well, we're still not going to tell
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.760]   you here are the rules that will get your app approved."
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.080]   They can say, "Here are reasons why we're approving a lot of different apps."
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.760]   - More importantly, just...
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.960]   - Disapproving a lot of apps.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.960]   - Yeah.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.140]   - That is a troubling line, the idea that if there are a lot of apps that do what your
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.680]   app do, they didn't say that it won't be approved.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   But if you are the 91st app that simply turns on the LED and turns into a flashlight, then
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.880]   you're not going to go through.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.680]   That should be a good piece of warning.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.760]   So it's a good thing to keep in mind, but I think that it's mostly instructive to the
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   developers saying, "Don't just copy what another app does.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.260]   Do something...
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.520]   Try to reduce the clutter that's on the App Store."
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.880]   That's the cure and curation.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.040]   - And I think as a user, I like to see that.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.240]   It's not that I don't want a lot of different choices, but I do want the apps to distinguish
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.280]   themselves from each other as I'm buying them.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.360]   Because one of the things that we don't have is you don't have quite the same support
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.640]   information that you would have.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.480]   You don't have a lot of demos.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.240]   The App Store doesn't really handle demos very well.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.080]   And so it's really hard to test a lot of this stuff.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.320]   So I ended up like, and what's nice about it is that most of the stuff is cheap.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.880]   When I wanted a walkie-talkie application for my iPhone, I just bought all of them.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.360]   And it was a little bit painful.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.400]   I spent $20 or $30 on a whole bunch of walkie-talkie ones.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.760]   And there's really only one that I recommended a couple of weeks ago that I felt was really
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.000]   usable.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   But I'm happy that there was a couple of my wish hadn't been approved.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.440]   Because they were completely not workable.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.800]   And so the thing is, they just don't work.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.360]   And so I spent $3 on something that doesn't really matter.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.960]   I wonder why it got approved in that case.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.040]   Well, it's hard to tell if it's not working unless you have a specific use.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.720]   If you have someone sitting there testing it, yeah, the buttons work.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.560]   And yeah, this is the one thing that does bother me is there's this implication that
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.440]   the review process is somehow perfect.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.800]   And so that you're protected, you're secure, they're not going to be apps that are bad
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   apps.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   And so you're not going to work in there.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.120]   And in fact, it can't be perfect.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.720]   Well, I think it's the other way around.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.320]   I think that developers have an expectation that it's like detecting radon where I'm sorry,
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.480]   you scored 12 parts per million instead of 400.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.680]   And so therefore, it has to be rejected.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.800]   It is going to be a very slippery and analog process, no matter how they do it.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.480]   And I think to your point, Andy, also, it's just so frustrating.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.360]   I think about my friend, some of my friends, I think about like, Nev and Mergen and like
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.800]   what that guy puts into an app.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.240]   It's like the polish that goes into some of these, some of my friends, this polish that
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.440]   goes into their apps is astounding.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:03.840]   And I just, I don't make iPhone apps eventually, but right now I could see being really frustrated
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.320]   and putting that kind of polish into an app and being scrutinized so carefully.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.160]   Last time I was on the iTunes Store, the number one free app was in a virtual pimple
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   pop.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   Right.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.000]   And see, this is, and you know, you're getting the same scrutiny, whether you're a pimple
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.360]   pop or whether you're a serious pro that's, that's.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.200]   This is where my complaint is that Apple kind of promotes the notion.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.480]   That, oh, you know, this is going to be a great experience for users and they're only going
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.800]   to be valuable apps.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   And it really isn't that.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.200]   I don't think they ever said that second thing.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.720]   I think it's going to be a better experience, not a great, it doesn't have to be necessarily
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   a great experience.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.120]   But when I see, when, when I download some of the apps that don't work or things that
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.480]   I'm really like, I can't believe someone's actually selling this, I often think I can't
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.320]   imagine how bad it would be if there wasn't anybody looking at that.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   Because it's, you know, I stopped buying.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   That's the problem.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   It's the Android marketplace.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   That's the example.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.280]   And it's mostly free because, and why is it mostly free?
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.160]   Because you don't know, you have no idea whether it's going to work.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.720]   Well, I, I actually have to disagree for a couple of things.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.280]   Number one, if you buy an application on the Android marketplace and you uninstall it
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.080]   within 24 hours, you get your money back.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.080]   Wow.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   Which is something that Apple should do that.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.280]   You know, that means, because that means an Apple has to give that money back to that
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.640]   means that's, there's a reason that they don't do that, which is they don't want to
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.800]   give back that money.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.120]   Well, and I think that that's not.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.960]   There's a reason why Android does that.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.680]   And that's because it doesn't want to vet its applications too carefully.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.760]   Well, which would you prefer?
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   I want both.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.760]   I mean, you can't play both sides of the street.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.040]   I prefer the choice between iPhone and Android.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.880]   I'm happy that there are two platforms out there.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880]   Oh, very well played, sir.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   Well played.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   And it's so good.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.640]   I really don't know if you're going to say the madness.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.080]   That's a good story.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.320]   You know, and actually, MG Seagler wrote an interesting piece on Tech Crunch about he's
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.280]   saying, look, Andrew is not open because look what all the carriers are doing to it.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.920]   You know, because it's an open source, anybody can do anything and end up making these closed
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   things.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.360]   But so I don't think opens the right word, but maybe choice is the right word.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   And you're right.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:04.440]   There's the overarching choice, the meta choice between Apple, iPhone and Android phones and
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.200]   Windows, mobile phones and Blackberry phones.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   And that choice is important.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.920]   But I think even within Android, you have more choice.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.560]   And you have, and I think that the Android marketplace works fine.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   I don't see the problem that people often ascribe to it of having a huge amount of bad
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.960]   stuff or unusable stuff or by the way, malware.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.720]   I don't think it's a particularly malware.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.560]   I don't think it's a malware problem, but it's frustrating that when I go into the app
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.800]   store on the iPhone, I'm looking for a camera app.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.480]   I will have to try three or four before I find before I'll find one that's polished as
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.680]   a feature as I like.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.200]   In Android, I can get to the, you have reached the end of the app store.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.480]   There are no more decent apps.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   You're done.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.840]   Which of these four apps did you try?
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.600]   Or excuse me, two apps did you try?
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   Did you hate less?
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   Okay.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   Well, I guess I'll go with this one.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.960]   Very well, it doesn't suit my needs, but I need an app that does this and that's what
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   I've got available.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.920]   That's increasingly not the case, of course, because there's 80,000 apps now.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.200]   Andy, I think you just nailed two problems, really.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.020]   I mean, for me, one of them is namespace pollution, which is that my understanding is
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.000]   on the app store, you have to have a name that is unique.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.560]   And so the first person who upload an app called camera gets camera.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   Well, you've seen that there's a big squatting problem now on the app store.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   Sure, sure.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   Sure, sure.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:21.680]   So, I think it's a problem, a UX problem, of making it very difficult to sort and sub-sort.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.200]   And especially when I'm looking and browsing on a mobile device, it's very hard to get
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.520]   a true sense of what?
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.080]   Of not just what's most popular or featured.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   But do you know what I'm saying, Andy?
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.040]   Like, I wish that you could look at it a little bit.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.120]   I should say, like, cameras is a perfect example.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.320]   Because some of those cameras, I mean, the difference between what?
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:49.080]   The difference between camera plus, for example, which is one of my go-tos, I have this HDR
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.080]   camera app.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.760]   I've got like three camera apps I really like.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.680]   I've got a bunch of sort of effects apps I really like.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.720]   But the difference between one of those that's like good versus the ones of those that are
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.800]   excable is an ocean of difference.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.000]   Some of these are like, literally, they could be, I'm not even, understand, I'm not that
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   guy.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   I'm not like, that's right.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   To me, it's like YouTube.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.480]   I just really wish that Apple would do like an editorial subcategory.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.360]   It's no good to simply have one category called productivity that has 1,000 apps in it.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.320]   I want productivity work processors, productivity, personal information organizers.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.840]   Maybe you're not going to let the--
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   See, I don't want apps to do anything.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.040]   This is why I like the Android Store.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.840]   I want the user-- no, really, seriously, I like the users to do this kind of thing.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.080]   There's good choices.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.560]   There's websites.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.360]   Why should Apple be the one that the arbiter of all this?
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.440]   Because you're paying the money to do that.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.000]   But they don't do a good job.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.160]   They have 24 hard apps on there.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   You've already said that--
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.400]   They want to put 200 bucks for an Android phone and then you can deal with Google's usual
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.000]   policy, which is, well, there you go.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Good luck with that.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   But you don't have to because there's 100--
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   We're not really--
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.760]   Because there's 100-- there's 100-- there's plenty of support out there.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760]   There's reviews.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.000]   You're saying I would prefer something like-- I don't know what the example would be,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Viddler versus YouTube.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   You know, look at the reviews.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.600]   I think what I'm asking for is a simple word.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.160]   I'm looking for a librarian.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   And what a librarian does--
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   Well, that's just plenty of people to do that.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.920]   Should Apple be the librarian?
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.160]   Well, let me ask you this, Leo.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.200]   If you wanted to buy a camera app today, how would you decide which one to pick on the iPhone?
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.960]   I'd read the reviews.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   Really?
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.120]   Wouldn't you?
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.640]   What would you do?
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.480]   Well, first of all, you can't try them and get your money back.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.320]   So you've got a disadvantage there.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.840]   I experienced reading those reviews.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.720]   Not the-- not the app store reviews.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.120]   Those are crappy, I agree.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.920]   Oh, you mean on the web?
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.920]   Going to web.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.080]   I mean the web, yeah.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.080]   And the app--
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.080]   Yeah, I guess--
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.360]   People are treating the apps-- the app store like it has to do everything.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.600]   I think it doesn't do everything.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.200]   Well, I think it should do a little bit more.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   That's all.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   Maybe it should do more.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.000]   I mean, this gets back into-- and I kind of got down this path before.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.680]   But this goes back to like the thing I was talking about with music where I'd love to
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.840]   be able to say, show me other people that have bought apps like me, and I can control
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   that correlation.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840]   That's apps, rain, and Android.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.640]   There's nothing like that on the iPhone.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.840]   And then let me say, when they buy it, enough people in my cloud that I've created-- I don't
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:05.840]   even know who the cloud is.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.000]   I don't want it to be like Ping where I'm choosing people.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.320]   I wanted to choose a correlation cloud that tells me how many people I've got.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.320]   I think Ping will do that.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   I think Ping will eventually do that.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.400]   Well, yeah, I was buying music last night and Ping told me a little bit of the thing,
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.200]   the sidebar, said, oh, by the way, that album you're looking to-- right now, Adam Anksvone's
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   this.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   I'm like, oh, well, Adam Anksvone.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   So you think a Ping for apps is what's going to happen?
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.000]   I think it'll be helpful.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.560]   I think something that allows us-- I think the problem right now with a lot of these things,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.680]   whether it's Twitter or whether it's Ping or whatever, is that we are being limited
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   by our own consciousness.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   And what I mean by that is that we're picking people that we want to follow.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.960]   But the reality is, is that what we really want is people that are correlated to us,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.680]   correlated to our views, and we don't need to know who they are.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.760]   And if we were able to simply control--
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.120]   This has all been solved on Android, but--
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.600]   That's a really good point, Alex.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   It's a self-selecting bias.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.680]   There's this app on Android called AppBrain.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   You could follow me.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   You could follow anybody you want.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.680]   You could see what they buy.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   You can find out about it.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   You could read reviews.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   It's a very effective app.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.880]   But I don't want to follow-- I don't want to say I want to follow you.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.120]   What I want to say is look at everybody who's buying through the app store.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.960]   And give me a correlation.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.680]   So what I can do is I want two dials.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.800]   One is the number-- Build me a cloud that is a correlation.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.240]   So basically, if I set the correlation to 100%, it's one.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   That's me.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.480]   But as I pull that down, I see a bigger, bigger cloud that people-- I don't know who they
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   are.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.480]   Their privacy is protected.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   Have you looked at the genius?
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.520]   Does it do a good job of recommendations for me?
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   It does OK.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.960]   It's just that the problem is, is that what we're missing is, is that all these companies,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   Netflix, Apple, everybody--
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   What's up does this?
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.280]   Everyone is trying to figure out how to do it automatically.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.720]   I don't want them to do it automatically.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.680]   I want two sliders.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.760]   Let me control the correlation.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:48.680]   And let me decide at what level, if 30% or 20% or 50% pick it, then I will-- then tell
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   me about it.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.640]   And the thing is, by me having control over the sliders, I can control the flow.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.680]   I can decide, oh, I'm getting too much crap, so I'm going to turn the correlation up a
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.720]   little bit, or I'm getting too many of these, and I'm going to turn up the stringency of
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.960]   when to show it to me.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.200]   And as a user, I can control my flow by doing that.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.080]   And I think that that would make a massive difference on purchasing lots of things.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   And getting news, getting apps, getting music.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:15.480]   You can see this in a lot of environments, Twitter and Dig, and a lot of environments.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   And nobody does it.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.880]   And my suspicion is, they don't do it because it scares off users.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   It becomes so complicated.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   But it's too little.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   I agree.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.880]   I agree.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.640]   So, you know, it's interesting also, is when you use Netflix, I've actually-- I think Netflix
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.840]   is a company that really interests me for a lot of reasons.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.440]   And one of the reasons is, clearly, the way that they are compensated involves getting
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.200]   people to add lots of things to their queue.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:43.080]   That to me feels like something they've identified as a business goal, just because they're constantly
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.320]   pushing you, now try this, now try this, now try this.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.840]   And I got to say, a lot of the times, the special sauce is pretty good.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   To your point, Alex, I like that they say, here's what we think you will think of this,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.360]   based on our secret sauce.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.440]   One thing I want to say, Leo, to your point, I agree with you.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.760]   Whatever I am going to go into, what is it like?
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.160]   If I wanted to go by Boner Medicine on the internet, I'd be screwed.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.320]   Because the thing is, there's so much fake Boner ads that, like, is impossible.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.600]   And for certain kinds of apps, you definitely run into that.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.480]   So, yes, I will go and search with Google.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.520]   But-- and I don't mean this as a slam, but given the fact how many of those links you
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.400]   click on, go to-- what is it?
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.040]   Click Synergy, right?
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.160]   There's a big incentive for people to do these crappy dumps of 45 indispensable camera apps.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   Well, this is like--
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   And like curation is important.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   I agree with you.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   No, no, no, exactly.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.080]   So that's why, I mean, for myself, it's just my opinion.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.520]   I start with Macworld.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.800]   I start with Macworld.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   Because I trust Chris Brie.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   Right, right, right.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   You know, the problem is, like, the same problem in some flavor runs through all of
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.440]   this, which on some level, to quote Gordon Gekko, is greed.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.520]   It's that most of the reasons people want to help you with anything is that they're
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.760]   trying to make a buck.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.320]   There's not that much real curation.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.960]   And real curation is a way of saying, I've done a lot of the cognitive load and processing
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.120]   for you.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.320]   And I want to show you why I think this is good for this sort of person.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   And then you can draw your own conclusions.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.320]   I agree with you.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   Apple should not be our mom.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.760]   But at the same time, I think as long as there's this financial incentive to just push
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.160]   this mass of people toward the app store for them to make a nickel here and there,
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.240]   you know, it's just more pollution on top of the pollution.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.440]   Well, that's why I'm saying Apple shouldn't be the curator.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.360]   It should be third party curation.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.160]   How's this for a curveball?
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.200]   A very Microsoft thing.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:39.280]   Could you ever see, gentlemen, of the board, could you ever see Apple having a tiered program
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:45.440]   where you could pay a little extra to become iTunes approved or similar?
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.880]   Sort of like, you know what I'm saying, a very Microsoft-esque way to handle that.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.080]   But you ever see them having a premium tier where it's not necessarily about buying placement,
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.840]   but it's about saying it's been tested against the following kinds of things.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.720]   It's guaranteed virus free, whatever.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.920]   Could you ever see them doing that?
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.880]   No, because that way, everyone who's not participating in that program would say, wait
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.920]   a minute, you're saying that without this shield, it means that my app could be filled
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   with virus.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.800]   Well, an imaginable liability issue, if you don't discover the virus in there and you've
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   still got to have it.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   You'll never see any company assert ever that something's secure because you can't.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.720]   I see that Mac-a-fi thing hundreds of times a day.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   What is it saying, though?
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.200]   This site doesn't have any viruses on it.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.360]   No matter what it's saying, your point is that people don't do that and I'm saying they
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   do.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.960]   I'm saying all the time, how many times do you see it?
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.560]   Yeah, but read carefully what it's asserting.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.280]   It's not asserting that you're safe.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.720]   This was checked for something something.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.560]   We've checked you for the flu, but he may still have the theory.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.760]   I think that Apple would be saying that any apps that do not have that shield are at risk
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.520]   for several things that we should be covering your butt from.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.520]   So they would never ever do that.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.120]   It seems to me that would be something that nobody would want to do.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.440]   Don't you think at some point they're going to want and need a way?
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   I mean, I don't think that'll happen.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.640]   Even Microsoft, which desperately wanted and needed such a thing, hasn't done that.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   I know.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.280]   They do it in such a way that we apply to all apps, I think.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.600]   I do feel overwhelmed by the, I'll just say, the amount of stuff that's on the App Store.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.320]   I think there is a fair, it is fair to state that there is a business problem with the
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.880]   amount of stuff and how hard it is to kind of get to what you want.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.000]   There must be a name for this concept.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.520]   There's too many videos on, there's too many blogs, there's too much stuff, it's overwhelming.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.640]   There's got to be a name for this.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.240]   This is a situation.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:34.160]   But I'm just saying this is an objection commonly raised in every sphere where democracy has
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.320]   allowed anybody to create something is, oh, it's too much.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.800]   I don't want so much.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.280]   I just want the best.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.880]   YouTube is a perfect example.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:48.360]   There's too many videos and there's got to be a name for that.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.480]   Somebody said old man syndrome.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   It's not old man syndrome.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.320]   It's called a first world problem.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.640]   But you see it, you hear this argument a lot and I hear it a lot when I first started
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.840]   talking about the democratization of media, people say, oh yeah, but then if everybody
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.320]   has a voice, it's cacophony.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.200]   And I just, but I don't know in my heart, I feel like it's better to have that and then
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.480]   have some form of curation laid on top of it, crowd sourced curation, by the way, not
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.720]   single point curation laid on top of it.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.880]   Then it is to say the old way, which is this gated community that only those with the resources
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   could enter.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   Well, I think that-
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   No, totally, totally.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.000]   But I mean, also, but you also then run into the gaming, you know, where you seek.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Of course you do.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   There's all sorts of stuff that happens.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.880]   I don't doubt for a second that people are out there just reading those reviews.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.560]   Marco, Marco Arment from Tumblr, you guys probably saw this the other day.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:41.200]   Marco scraped, I don't want to misstate what he did, but he basically went in and grabbed
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.840]   all of the reviews for the top N apps of different kinds.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.840]   And he basically-
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.840]   Oh, I saw that with the words.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   Most commonly used keywords.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   It's really interesting.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.240]   The pattern that comes up in all of them is generally price.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.840]   Like was this like worthwhile?
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.880]   And I know sometimes I'll go and look at an app and it's just, it's really the same thing
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.560]   as anything on the web where once you allow people to review something, you see the mob
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.840]   and then you see the reaction to the mob and you see all these takedowns.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:11.800]   Once something is on like the top N on the iTunes store, people just go after it.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   There's these great apps that people are just, they're literally saying things like, I guess
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   I should have read the description.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.000]   You see that a lot of people don't you?
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.760]   Now, have you also noticed now, have you also noticed when you get an app now or when,
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.800]   do you notice when you get updates on your iPhone, how often now in the release notes,
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:34.520]   if you're a nerd who reads that, they'll say, we have no way to respond to call.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.240]   So, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:54.680]   who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.120]   who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:09.320]   who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people,
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.400]   I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying,
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.320]   I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying,
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.440]   I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying,
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:29.200]   I think that's a lot of people who are saying, I think that's a lot of people who are saying,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:35.320]   turns at $2,000 a pop and it's a real big bummer, and so it's really nice to, that's the one
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.720]   thing I am excited about and I'm glad that there's a lot of downward pressure on the prices
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.320]   because it makes me buy a lot of apps, I still spend a lot of money on apps but I know that,
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:49.280]   I got a map of Paris that was just totally useless, some map software, I'm not going to
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:55.720]   mention who they were, but it was just totally useless, and it cost me $5.99 or whatever,
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.920]   and I was mad for about an hour and then I was like, well, it's a price of a coffee here.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.320]   Yeah, it's not ideal, but at least it makes it acceptable.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:10.000]   I mean, whenever I hear about someone who wants to price an app at $10 or $20, they might tell
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.400]   me how much money it costs for them to develop it because they have a team of programmers,
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:21.480]   but I'm thinking, wow, it's almost as if I take out my usual iPhone app using brain
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.440]   and put in a brand new brain whenever the price gets above $9.99 because do you have
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.720]   to dazzle me with an app on the iPhone or even the iPad above $9.99?
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:37.200]   Here's Marco's most common words unique to one star and five star app store reviews.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:43.480]   He crawled the reviews for the top 100 apps from every category.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:50.280]   The five star rating, most common words were awesome, worth, thanks, amazing, simple,
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.000]   perfect price, everything ever must.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.480]   iPod before found store never recommend done.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.240]   Take always in touch.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.000]   And the one star's waste money crashes, tried useless.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.760]   Nothing paid open, deleted, downloaded, didn't says stupid.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.240]   Anything actually account bought Apple already.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.440]   You know, that is such an interesting.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   That's like, like beat poetry.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.440]   That is beautiful.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   It is.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.760]   I sure should be in those one star reviews.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.640]   The one word that really should be in a lot of this jail broken.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   Jail broken.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:30.320]   I just, I see a bunch of street kids in there going like sir, or fail.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.400]   It's like, dude, you're, you're a little, you're a little broken phone, you know, it's
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.860]   like, useless is a very common word he says in the one star's more than any other adjective
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:42.720]   reviewers condemn apps they don't like as useless.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.840]   And again, I think that for me, a lot of what I don't really write reviews of apps that
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.560]   I don't like that often unless they are more than about $2.99 or $3.99.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.560]   Right.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.240]   And if I don't like them and they're more than $3.99, then you're going to get a piece
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.240]   of my mind.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.080]   You know, you know, there's going to be a whole lot of like, okay, because under that,
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.800]   I'm like, you know, didn't work.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   So we're going to take a little bit of a break.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.360]   I do have my, my, my source of Verizon with some surprising news.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.640]   We'll get to that in just a little bit more news too.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.200]   And then of course our picks of the week, but this portion of the show brought to you
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.200]   by our friends.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:19.000]   Citrix who make a product for those of you who have friends, relatives, maybe even clients,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.240]   maybe even do this for a living who need help.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.400]   It's called go to assist express.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.880]   And if you've never used it, you've got to give it a try.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.600]   It is absolutely the best program out there for helping people online.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:39.240]   If you go to go to assist.com and take a look at it, you'll see all sorts of nice features
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.560]   designed for the support professional.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.920]   Things like eight sessions at once.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:49.840]   You don't have to, your support person, whether it's your mom, your dad, or, you know, the
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.160]   client down the hall or across the world, doesn't have to have it installed ahead of
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   time.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.960]   You just, you can give them a link or even send them to the webpage, go to assist.com
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.320]   and say, you know, here's your support ticket.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.400]   Enter this in within seconds.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:07.840]   You're in their system fixing their stuff like ceiling cat just in there, making it better.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:13.120]   And even makes that noise.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:17.400]   Business let's see, go to assist express was a name, the worldwide market leader in remote
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.000]   support by Frost and Sullivan.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.840]   This is an analyst group that focuses on that sector.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.280]   The number one remote support solution worldwide because it's easy to use.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.760]   It's affordable.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   It's secure.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.280]   They even have day passes for the part time helper.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.360]   You can see what software is running, what security software is running in the background,
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.360]   all of that.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:40.440]   Go to assist.com/ Now I got to see because this is the first time we've advertised this
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.040]   on the show.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.640]   Slash Mac break, go to assist.com/macbreak.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.520]   Yes, of course it works with Macs and Windows.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.440]   In fact, what's cool is you can support a Windows PC from your Mac or vice versa.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.920]   Go to assist, try it free for 30 days.
[00:59:53.920 --> 01:00:01.920]   Go to assist.com/macbreak whenever my mom has a tech support needs.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.960]   That's where I fire up go to assist.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   Here it is.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.920]   I don't want to say names.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.000]   This guy works at Verizon.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.280]   He runs a team that evaluates and tests new hardware.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.600]   He's in pretty good situation to know what's coming up.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.480]   He says, "I and my team have a solid six month.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.880]   In fact, nearly 12 months, look at the Verizon roadmap."
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   As part of the test process, he says, "Neither the iPhone nor the iPad are on that roadmap."
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.640]   He said, "What if, for instance, the iPhone will be tested and launched outside of normal
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   procedures?"
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.080]   He says, "Well, I know the HQ device testing folks, they don't know anything.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.800]   Perhaps only the sea level folks at Verizon know what the plan will be.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.760]   But if they don't test it, well, we know what happens when you launch something in your
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.080]   own test."
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.880]   He also says, "See?
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   Hello?"
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.280]   I was just saying, or the possibility that the people who are not supposed to talk about
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.920]   this at Verizon are not, in fact, talking about this.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   Could be.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.840]   I'll just, you know, we're hearing this very solid rumor now that January for the Verizon
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   phone.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.440]   And he says, "I don't see it happening."
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.680]   Yeah, this is, but there's somebody at Verizon watching this going, "This is why we don't
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.640]   tell you about it."
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.360]   And we leaked information.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.960]   We worked working on the Verizon phone only to you and it got out that we're not working
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.960]   on an iPhone.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960]   Collect your things.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   So, what did they have?
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.600]   A secret skunk works testing Verizon?
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.080]   If you were trying to make sure that this worked with Apple and you understood Apple's
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:42.320]   intensity, you would have a completely separate group and said, "We're going to, we would
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.240]   like to borrow, your finger is going to have a little ring and if you do anything wrong,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.080]   we're just going to push the button and remotely pop it off."
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.040]   Also he does say that there is an exception, perhaps, with the iPad because we only have
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.040]   to test the wireless module.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.240]   So since the module may already be certified, they may not have to go through a testing
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.400]   process for the iPad.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:09.760]   So it is very possible that he says an iPad could be launched at Verizon wireless without
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.400]   internal teams knowing about it.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.920]   He seems pretty convinced, but okay, I'm just giving you that.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:19.000]   I'm just saying as usual, as soon as someone hands me an iPhone or an iPad with a Verizon
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.040]   logo on it, then I'll actually know.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.160]   I won't believe it because one concession we'll definitely get is that you're not allowed
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.480]   to put the Verizon logo anywhere on the device.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480]   What's your name?
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.720]   That's right.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.600]   How many people do you think, is there a huge pin up demand waiting for the iPhone to go
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   on a Verizon?
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   A lot of people who are believing.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.960]   I'll tell you what, Consumer Reports did it again.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:46.760]   Apple, as you know, the free bumper program ends a couple of weeks this month.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.200]   And Consumer Reports said, "You know what?
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.000]   We're still not recommending the iPhone 4.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.480]   We think consumers shouldn't be required to fix a manufacturing defect.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.040]   We do believe there is a manufacturing defect in the iPhone 4 with the antenna.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.160]   And we're not too happy about them discontinuing the bumper program."
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.720]   So do you think there are a lot of people who read these reviews and say, "Huh?"
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.400]   Well, actually, they're not discontinuing the entire program.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.120]   They're just continuing the free case program.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.640]   You can still get a free bumper case.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.120]   Oh, I get it.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.080]   We now know the iPhone 4 antenna attenuation issue is even smaller than we originally thought,
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.640]   good news, a small percentage of blah, blah, blah, a small percentage of the case.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.320]   We want to continue providing them a bumper case for free for everyone else.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.480]   We are discontinuing the free case program on all iPhone 4 sold after September 30th.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   Got it.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   Okay.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   Is that a change?
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.240]   Because it was my impression when Steve announced it that they said through September
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.400]   30th for the whole program.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.720]   So it sounds like they've decided to keep the bumpers going.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   All right.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720]   All right.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:53.320]   So it looks like the ones that they make themselves are good, but they're not going to keep buying
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.800]   stuff from Scrochet or other manufacturers.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   Right.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.480]   I think the number one limiter to how many iPhones Apple is selling is how fast they can make
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   them.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480]   At this point, you're right.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.480]   It's still three weeks.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   It's three weeks.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   It is.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   Wait.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   So there can't be too much pent up demand.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   And I couldn't believe--
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.480]   Also, it's--
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   Go ahead.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   I'll take a look later.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.240]   The one thing I have to say is that while I thought I saw a lot of iPhones in the United
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:22.000]   States, in London and in Paris, it was all iPhones.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.600]   I mean, I was amazed at how many-- I mean, there was a handful of business people I saw
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.560]   with Blackberries, but outside of that, it was like everybody had an iPhone.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.040]   I was kind of taken aback by that.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.520]   I thought there was an interesting detail.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.840]   There was a very long in depth interview with the CEO of Foxconn.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.520]   It's a very basic profile of the industry Titan.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.720]   What a great article that was, by the way.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.240]   It was a must read, great, great article.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.880]   But hidden in the middle of it, it's about a third of the way in, is the interesting
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:05:00.240]   information that when Apple locked in on that iPhone 4 metal band case, and Foxconn said,
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.800]   well, we can't make this because you need a special cyber machine to make this case.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.040]   And it's a machine that was designed not for mass production, but for doing one-offs
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.360]   it's a prototype.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.080]   And so Apple said, no, we really like this design.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.280]   And so they had a buy to-- I think the number was 2000.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.880]   I think it was 2000.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.880]   I think it was 2000.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.800]   Of these machines, just so that they could manufacture enough of these cases because,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.840]   again, the machine is not designed for mass production.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.360]   Just for the metal band.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.160]   Just for that metal band.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.920]   It's a really interesting article.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   So it's amazing they're keeping up with demand at all.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   So you're right.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.920]   It's moot.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.920]   So what if there's pent up demand?
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   They can't make enough anyway.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   I mean, that's the-- I mean, I think that--
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   iPad seems to have caught up.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.920]   You can get an iPad down a couple of days.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.080]   And I think that the-- I think the iPhone will continue to be strong.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.960]   I think that if they did release it, I think there is a lot of people that want-- that
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.920]   are on Verizon that really are committed to having a great phone service.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   Right.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   And right.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.720]   As crazy as that may sound to have with a phone, that's crazy.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.560]   That's not part of that 90% of the 90% is it though.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.560]   No, no.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.560]   It's crazy.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   Crazy talk.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.200]   No, there's-- and of course, they're selling the Wi-Fi iPad in China, which shows that they
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.240]   can make them fast enough because you're suddenly opening up a huge market for your iPad.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.240]   Right.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.200]   So the iPad they've licked, I guess it's that band.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.640]   Well, I think the iPad is a lot more expensive and the demand is a lot lower than the iPhone.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.640]   Of course, you're right.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.800]   So you're just moving a lot less-- not really more expensive when you add the two years--
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   Right.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   But it's interesting.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.520]   But how much it hurts when you--
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   Out of pocket.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   Out of pocket, I think.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.280]   We're not sophisticated to think that far out.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.640]   How much do you think the iPhone supply stuff has to do with-- is it at all related to the
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.640]   white iPhone issue?
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   Still can't get the white iPhone.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.640]   Well, I don't--
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640]   I'm asking.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.280]   Do you think there's cycles totally unrelated?
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.920]   All I could say is that there is a fascinating-- I was talking to a manufacturer who I'll
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.520]   remain nameless in IBC.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.760]   And they had a product that uses one part that shares with the iPhone.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.720]   He said it costs a penny for this one little chip that they need.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   And they're just easy.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.080]   It's mass manufacturing.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:16.440]   He said we had to delay our release of our product by three months because Apple bought
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440]   the world supply.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440]   Every one of them.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.160]   You know, Apple bought-- Apple needs a bunch of them for every iPhone or whatever.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.560]   And he said they just bought it out.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.560]   They can't--
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.560]   It's really amazing.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.560]   This is challenging.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.560]   This is a successful product can bring up, right?
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.560]   Especially in the electronics industry where you know how it supports.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.720]   I was talking to somebody who's in manufacturing, not a different kind of electronic.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.960]   And I got a 20 minute lecture on how difficult it is to make something white.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.040]   The reason why so many things are black is that black is easy.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:49.000]   Not only that, but black will hide a multitude of manufacturing and molding defects.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   If not only-- you start off with a problem of how do you make 100, let alone 100,000 copies
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.160]   of something that are the same shade of white.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.800]   But then there's a problem of now that means we have to build these things in a whole separate
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:06.120]   place because if anything interferes with them, that finish, even if it's just not changing
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:11.240]   color, but a change in how light will react to that section of the surface, it will scream
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   out in white.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.840]   And so that's why I have no insight information about Apple's manufacturing problems.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.040]   But he was making clear to me that as soon as I heard that there's going to be a white
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.120]   iPhone material that they haven't-- they didn't have much experience with, I thought, oh boy,
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.360]   that's going to be a collector's item.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360]   So much experience.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   Ah.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360]   Kindle.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.440]   Slamming the iPads.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   Let's take a look.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.880]   Yeah, I've had-- here they are at Lovely Pool.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.040]   He's trying to read on his iPad.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   There's a lovely lady.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   And what are you looking at?
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   The iPad.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   Hey.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   How are you reading that?
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040]   She's reading this light.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040]   Kindle.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.040]   It's a Kindle.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.040]   139 dollars.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   I actually paid more for these sunglasses.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   Also, I can't read.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.920]   You know, well, a lady with this reflective screen, I can see you and me together.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.520]   There's a guy going home alone.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.360]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360]   Holy cow.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360]   Really?
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.360]   Tell me more about it.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.360]   Why?
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.520]   Is the view angle on that Kindle screen wide enough that the two of us on that couch
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   can watch it together?
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.000]   Excuse me, Madam, is your Kindle felt?
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   Would you like to be?
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   It is now.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.680]   Can you play-- here's my only question is, can you play Angry Birds on that Kindle?
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680]   I don't think so.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.680]   There you go.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.680]   He should be playing Angry Birds.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]   There you go.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.040]   Well, if we're a processor, that can actually look a cloudless lead of the Dropbox and
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.240]   I can drive the Kindle, I can really easily--
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.920]   Stiffy's new in the Apple support store this Express Lane.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   This is kind of cool.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.840]   You pick the product category.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.760]   It's a finder-like browser.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   Then you pick the product and then you select a support category and then you can put in
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.240]   your hardware serial number and it will give you support.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   This is kind of cool.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.440]   It's called Express Lane and somebody sent me a link in the chat room.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.400]   That looks pretty cool.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.680]   The new Express Lane support from Apple.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.760]   Okay, just thought I'd throw that in.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.280]   Let's take a-- actually, I don't have a break.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.040]   We could go right into our picks of the week unless you guys-- I'll give you one chance
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.040]   to bring up a story, any story that you think--
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   Can I ask something that's off-topic?
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040]   It's unusual for me.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:25.560]   Did you guys see David Pogue's rather enthusiastic review for the Virgin, MIFI and B, did you
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560]   see the comments?
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.320]   Well, one of the reasons I and others like it is because it's cheap.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.080]   It's $40 a month for the same sprint service to the business before.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080]   I'm asking for two reasons.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.240]   I'm asking because first of all, it sounds as they say in the business too good to be
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.040]   true, but I thought this is one of the seven times in the history of the internet where
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:48.160]   the comments were super, super interesting just because of people's experience with it.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.040]   I'm curious, Andy, you're the head nerd here.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.720]   Have you tried this thing?
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.880]   I have not tried it yet.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.520]   Hopefully, one is on its way.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.240]   I use the same hardware on Verizon.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.240]   The Nova's on.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.480]   Is my hearing that you don't have connectivity problems, Leo?
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480]   Not at all.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   Love it.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480]   Okay, good.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   Okay.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.760]   I actually triggered it because my new Droid X phone also has the same capability, so for
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   less.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760]   I have that still that.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.320]   As numerous commenters also opined.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.640]   I pop for the Verizon one and I'm happy with it, but not nearly as happy as I would be
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.720]   if that thing worked the way David describes it.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.080]   You have connectivity issues?
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.560]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.160]   I do not, but I do have spending too much on Verizon crap issues.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.800]   Yeah, I have that as well.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.400]   The way he describes it, what is it?
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.440]   It's $40 a month for unquote unlimited.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.080]   It's probably capped at five.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.440]   I think it's on the sprint network, yeah.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.800]   It's sprint via Virgin.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.040]   I've had conversations with sprints for then mobile.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.000]   The follow up, the follow up question is, oh, well, we define unlimited as five few bytes.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   So I definitely check.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.800]   I know sprint traditionally has been five.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.240]   I'll never understand.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.720]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.120]   Unlimited is five gigabytes.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   I don't get it.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.200]   I know that.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.120]   And you're doing a good, you're doing a good impression of Andy and not go at the end of
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   that conversation.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   Exactly.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   Hey, I think we should start a class.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.960]   What truth is truth is lies.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.200]   I'm saying class action.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.320]   I remember once in college, I saw the board at the Wendy's, you know, the little like,
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.040]   what's on specials up on the sign.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   It said, all you can eat cheeseburgers, 99 cents each.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.040]   And I thought, you know what?
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040]   That's true.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040]   There's no lies.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.520]   That's kind of what they're saying.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.520]   Where?
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.360]   You know, I mean, I would rather they say five gigs.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.120]   I'd rather say three gigs if it means three gigs, because if you've ever been on certain,
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.440]   I will not mention certain very popular shared hosting services where they've completely
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.600]   oversold.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.640]   And if one 10th of the people used the bandwidth that they said, they were going to use the
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.560]   whole place would collapse.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.040]   You know, again, you get back into these issues.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.320]   If you really use this stuff the way they say you're supposed to, if you really drive
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.960]   the car like they do in the commercial, you're going to die.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.400]   You know, that's how Jim Baker got sent to jail because for the same, for the exact same
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.760]   reasons, for the exact same stuff that phone carriers and broadband carriers.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.680]   So he was he went to jail because he sold he sold enough, like, time shares into his little,
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.960]   like, Christian theme resort that if everybody wanted to use it, there'd be no way he could
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.720]   serve all those rooms.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.320]   And he went to jail.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   Good TV for everybody.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.800]   But why?
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.440]   Somehow it's a different thing when Verizon and Sprint and all these other networks do it.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   Exactly.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   No one's ever going to do it, I guess.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.440]   Yes.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.880]   I thought his viewers patience was unmuted, which turned out.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.440]   He also looked like a frog.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.440]   That probably helped him.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.760]   What is it about TV ministers and having?
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:43.360]   I don't know what it is that Verlin's doing, but it was very effective that suddenly frozen.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.360]   Sorry.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.800]   That's why the word of God preventing you from bruising your punishment through the internet.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.960]   Hands on the Skype device.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.600]   So David apparently did not know that Virgin was owned by Sprint.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.840]   Are you complaining because his review was unusually?
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.560]   I'm not complaining at all.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.880]   I read it on the Insta paper and I went, "Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh."
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.400]   Because it sounded so magical.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400]   And then I went...
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.600]   Well, it did appear that David had never heard of this device, which has been out for like
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600]   a year and a half.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.160]   Well, you know, can I be honest?
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.600]   It seemed like he hadn't used it or touched it.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.440]   Well, I mean, that's why...
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:23.400]   So when I heard people ask me about it, I wanted to get one just to see if it burns.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.280]   I've had the My5 from Verizon.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.360]   I just...I reviewed it, sent it back, I liked it so much that I actually bought one because
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.360]   it's...
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   I took on your recommendation, David.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.360]   I have one too.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.120]   But the interesting thing though, this is one of the many things I would not have predicted
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.000]   in the post-IPAD world.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.040]   I am really considering dropping it only because it's 60 bucks a month.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.480]   And I feel as though I'm sort of in like one of those...
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.240]   That scene in the movie where two people are holding a grenade and the pin is dropped out
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.000]   and if anybody drops it, it destroys everybody.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.720]   That's what I feel like because I signed up for what I thought was going to be 30 days
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.320]   worth of 3G coverage on my iPad 3G.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.680]   And then AT&T announced we're going from unlimited con...
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.560]   Unlimited, real unlimited, all you can eat 3G to a cap of two gigs.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.720]   But if you're already on contract, you will continue to have that in perpetuity.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.200]   So I've unexpectedly added 30 bucks a month because I feel like I'd be an idiot with
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.080]   the Netflix app and all those other cool streaming apps on the iPad to say goodbye to
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.080]   unlimited...
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.480]   Like all you can eat, 40 gigabytes a month, doesn't matter, access to the internet.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.880]   And yet I feel as though it's stupid for me to be paying 30 bucks a month for this 3G
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   service and also 60 bucks a month for the MyFi.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.640]   Why don't I just get tethering when I need it on the months that I need it?
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.200]   And I have to admit that I use the MyFi as much for a Wi-Fi wireless...
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.880]   - Base station, yeah. - Base station.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.800]   So if I want to have a whole bunch of things connected and have a network that we're building
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.680]   like on set somewhere and I just need three or four computers to be connected, to me,
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.560]   I don't even care if it connects to the internet.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.800]   I just need it to be able to connect everybody together without having to plug anything
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   in, without...
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.480]   You know, I turned that thing on and I got five computers on a bus, on a plane.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.160]   I shouldn't say that on a plane.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.480]   Not that I would ever do that.
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.600]   So anyway, but I get everybody connected.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.960]   Without having to tie up one of the computers doing it.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.160]   I just got a real education.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.160]   Can you hear me?
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.160]   Am I coming through?
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.160]   I just got a real education.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.840]   I just went to England for the first time a couple of weeks ago.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.480]   And Gruber and I spent like two days trying to figure out how to use our phones over there.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.600]   And finally, what I ended up doing, I guess what I'm saying is I became acutely aware
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.280]   of how much the cloud can rain if you're not careful.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   I had...
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.440]   I bought basically what they consider a month worth of high activity use and I went through
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   it in two days.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   Oh yeah.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.440]   Oh, that's the international plan.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   So it's 50 megabytes and...
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.840]   Yeah, I bought 250 when I went to China.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.880]   The other thing I learned which was very disappointing is that the usage that's built
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.880]   into the iPhone where you check, you know, under usage is not honored by AT&T.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.960]   They say you have to check our app because apparently the digital roaming doesn't match.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.880]   So I was very careful to watch the usage in the phone, you know, in the settings in the
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   phone.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   And when I got to...
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880]   I think I bought 100 megs.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.160]   I stopped and turned off roaming, turned off data.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.960]   I had a couple of days left in China.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.320]   When I got the bill, it was for considerably more.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.120]   When I went without it, out at the first time thinking that, "Oh, I'm just going to use
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.600]   it every once in a while when I really need it."
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   It's really nice to have.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.600]   It's a hundred dollars.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.560]   It's great to have.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.360]   I have to say.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360]   It was one of those real...
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.480]   I can't believe I live in the 21st century moments where I was...
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.160]   The time that I was able to actually like, you know, send a picture to my sister and
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.240]   saying, "He does this look like I'm emailing you from Beijing because I'm totally emailing
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240]   you from Beijing."
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.360]   I mean, I stay underneath the 100 meg cab.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.040]   I bought the same plan that you did.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.280]   And I was smart.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.720]   I was lucky enough to read up about it enough to know that, "Oh, and by the way, don't cancel
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.080]   after the first month because sometimes it takes a month for the foreign carriers to
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.200]   submit their bills, so keep it for at least two months."
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.400]   It's still a good deal.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.960]   Well, and this is also the case where I really missed Alex and Andy.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.040]   I've got, like I said, the Verizon with little...
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.400]   The Wi-Fi will have up to five devices it allows.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.400]   I didn't realize exactly how much of a nerd I am until I went to this...
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.160]   You know, it is you go and you get the code for the Wi-Fi because it's so precious.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.760]   This quote unquote, "broadband internet that drops all the time."
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   You go to a hotel.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.360]   So I didn't want to use up all my AT&T time, so I had to go to the desk and ask for free
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.920]   code for the stupid Wi-Fi.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.440]   It's like Wi-Fi a few years ago was so exotic and now it's crazy to me.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   Yeah, it's...
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.360]   I can't believe how much I rely on it and I can't believe how much hotels...
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.720]   Well, I guess I can believe that they charge for it, but even at the free places.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.600]   You know, I have to admit that I...
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.520]   Well, number one is I know where every Starbucks is in London because we would go from Starbucks
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   to Starbucks.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.160]   You know, because anytime you needed to get a connection, it was like a breath of air.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   You'd be like underwater, unconnected.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.840]   And then it was because it's a free Wi-Fi connection.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.440]   So you get up to Starbucks and go, "We wouldn't buy anything.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.600]   We would literally just walk by the front of the Starbucks and check all of our email
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.880]   and do all our stuff."
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.160]   But the funny thing is that I didn't realize how many apps are on the App Store that are
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.320]   just maps of London, Paris, Amsterdam.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.960]   And all they do is they just give you your GPS and they tell you where you're at.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.600]   Why don't you use Google Maps, though?
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.400]   Because Google Maps requires bandwidth.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.840]   So the thing is is by you download the home...
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:46.960]   But I downloaded a 183 meg download of Paris from a coffee shop or whatever.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:54.040]   And then now had this detailed map with all the little wherever I want to go kind of things.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.280]   But anyway, it was just...
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.680]   But I was amazed at that.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.760]   But when I was sitting at LA, I actually...
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.440]   I was staying at this hotel, pretty nice hotel.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.560]   And they charge $14 a day.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.160]   And I basically got a 512 connection.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.640]   Performing $14 a day.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.200]   And I told them, "Here's the deal.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.640]   That I got better bandwidth in Zimbabwe."
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.960]   I literally sent them the email.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.280]   I got better bandwidth in Zimbabwe for a lot less money.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:25.880]   I'm happy to pay $22, $25 a day if you're going to give me a solid, like a solid 2 meg
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.360]   or 3 meg or 4 meg connection.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.520]   I'm that kind of user.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.480]   At least you should give me that option.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.840]   And then I got to Paris and there was 25 bucks a day, but it was really fast.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.320]   And so at first I was complaining and then I was like, "Okay, well, it's a 3 meg connection."
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.120]   And I was able to download all of our files and upload things we needed to.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:46.000]   But I didn't realize that I am just completely addicted to it.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.520]   I find it's not a luxury.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]   You just got to do that.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:51.560]   Well, kind of one thing that's at the heart of this, it's not a matter of going, "Oh,
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.040]   I got to check my email."
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.720]   It's a question of a lot of my devices have to share a Wi-Fi network.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:02.040]   So if I want to use iRelive very heavily on GoodReader, I rely...
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.880]   It's like four or five apps that really...
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.240]   It's not just fun, jokey stuff.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.280]   It's like how I run my business.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.960]   And they have to be able to sync with each other to do stuff.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   So...
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.960]   At least it's available.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   At least it's a possibility.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.760]   Well, and I think this is exactly why it does not make sense to have the laws that some
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.920]   of our states have picked up where municipalities cannot invest in their own internet.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.600]   Because I think this is becoming a...
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.760]   Especially if you're a tourist region, this is something that a mesh network that connects
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.240]   everyone in an entire city where I don't have to keep on logging in.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.240]   I don't have to find Starbucks.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.240]   I don't have to find a copy shop.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.240]   See what Chattanooga's doing?
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.240]   You might want to move to Chattanooga.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.040]   Well, I mean, Kigali Rwanda is YMAX.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.000]   The entire capital is YMAX.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.640]   They're running fiber into it for 10 bucks a month.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:47.320]   You have a 256-cay connection in the next 30 days.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.320]   And the thing is that that's what our city should be doing.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.400]   They should be considering that Chattanooga is a great example.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400]   What is that?
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   Is it going to be a gigabit?
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.640]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.760]   It's going to compete with Hong Kong and offering the fastest internet service on the
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   planet.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.360]   The time says, "By year-end, Chattanooga's high-speed internet service will be a gigabit
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.240]   a second."
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.080]   This is what that Google thing was going to be, right?
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.080]   So Chattanooga's...
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.320]   I guess Chattanooga's doing it.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   Well, and I think that municipalities have to consider this a competitive advantage in
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.920]   an area where unemployment may stay at 9 or 10 percent.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.200]   Well, you've got to think to companies who are now saying, "Hmm, I mean, if I'm a medium...
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.640]   I mean, I should move to Chattanooga.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.480]   If I can get gigabit, it's the Chattanooga Power Utility.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.080]   EPB will be doing it."
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.320]   Well, I mean, San Francisco doesn't...
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.640]   To me, I think San Francisco is actually a bad town to do tech.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.800]   Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.160]   My friend lives outside Portland.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.600]   I'm at Howie, like, lives in the sticks and gets Fios.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.680]   I have exactly one provider that I can get for internet, period.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.520]   It starts with a calm, ends with a cast, and has a giant suck in the middle.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.760]   That's literally the sole provider of internet connectivity in my area.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.760]   Which is...
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.320]   I guess there's that one you see a lot, there's that one wireless service you can get.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.360]   But as far as, like, wired internet, it's just mind-boggling.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360]   I think it's just spotty.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.520]   I don't think it's San Francisco, per se, or what...
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520]   It's just...
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.040]   It's inconsistent throughout the country, and it's one of those things that we haven't
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.200]   invested in as far as infrastructure goes.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.200]   And I think we should.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.200]   I think you're right.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.200]   It's a competitive advantage.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   Well, on the folks who did invest in infrastructure are still trying to amortize place in the
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.480]   wrong best way of the way that Chattanooga broadband will be through.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.920]   It's $50 a month for the gigabit.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.360]   But see, I pay 700 for 10 megabits.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360]   So...
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.360]   That's a lot of man.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360]   And I thought that was a deal.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.000]   I pay $1,000 for 10 meg's symmetrical.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   Right.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.960]   We got 9 meg's symmetric, and that's 700 here.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   So it is a deal.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   All right.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.480]   We've really got to wrap this puppy up.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.760]   I know you guys are beautiful and wonderful, but we're just running out of time here.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.800]   So maybe Alex, you can give us your pick of the week.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   Okay.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.280]   I have to say that I have a totally self-serving pick.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.280]   Okay.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   But I've worked very hard on it.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280]   Okay.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280]   Cool.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.280]   So cool.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   All right.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280]   Cool lanes.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:04.280]   We are releasing Conduit 2, which is our nodalcompositor, dbgarage.com.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.680]   And Conduit 2 is basically a...
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.040]   It is free for 90 days, and we're not sure what the price will be after that.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.440]   For the standalone version is free.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   So download it, check it out.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.640]   It is what this is, a nodal compositor based on the GPU.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.920]   It is screaming fast.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.920]   You can do green screen.
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:24.360]   You can feed a camera in live and key it live.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:31.320]   And when I say key it live, it uncompressed, 444 data into this thing or your little camera,
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.040]   whatever, and play with it.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.080]   There's a bunch of little tutorials there.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.760]   You can see how to use it.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.360]   It is a little Swiss Army knife for compositing and playing with videos.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.240]   And as I said, we're putting it up for free.
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:43.880]   We want people to get a chance to use it.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.480]   So instead of 30 days, which I don't think is enough to learn how to use this application,
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   it's 90 days.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   We've got some tutorials.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.160]   We've got kind of new tutorials in the not too distant future.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.120]   And look at the great graphic.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.440]   McKay did that in our office.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440]   Love it.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.280]   He is a god.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.520]   So anyway, so great.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.920]   Anyway, so we're very proud of it.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.920]   GRAJGOT.com.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.920]   Yep.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   Anyway, that's it.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   Muylin, Muylin man.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.720]   That is your pick?
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:13.760]   I am unmuting because my tactile pro 2.0 keyboard is the loudest thing.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.840]   I'm trying to quickly write this up so I can post this on my little site and you guys can
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.600]   see I'm going to go with two picks because I haven't been here for a while.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.480]   And I apologize if you've already done this one.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.480]   It's funny.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.920]   On my desktop, I don't open ICal anymore.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.160]   I go straight into busy Cal.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.320]   And now on my iPhone, I'm all about calvetica.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320]   Calvetica.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320]   Calvetica.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.320]   What?
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320]   What?
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320]   What is calvetica?
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.960]   It's like calvetica with a cow.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.360]   Well, you know, yeah, I guess it's part of the country.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   Cow like mookow or cal like California.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.240]   C-A-L as in gorgeous as in helvetica.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.240]   And it's what it is.
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.000]   It's basically a beautifully designed beautifully.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.640]   It's very simple looking but it's very functional.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   Oh, it's a calendar.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   It's not a font.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.640]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.640]   It's a replacement.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.360]   It's a helvetica-esque Swiss looking replacement, international design, excuse me, replacement
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.360]   for the calendar app.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.440]   And it's going to be difficult for me to explain without actually you can probably just see
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.760]   in this demo video.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.480]   It's very easy to quickly add things.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.760]   It's more intuitive to me in terms of how you use it.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.200]   It's got a nice little notifications pop up and nice little stuff like if you want to
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.120]   change the time of something, all you have to do is hit edit and then kind of scoot the
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.120]   event around.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   Oh, thank you.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.120]   Finally.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.920]   The first version of this was really beautiful and useful.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.480]   This 2.0 is on another level.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   I think it's a fan.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.480]   Oh, this is nice.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.880]   Are you catching in that video there?
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.120]   Are you catching all the different?
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.120]   So, I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.120]   I think it's a really nice thing to do.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   I really like, even if you're not like a helvetica, a calvetica, even if you're not a nerd for typefaces,
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   I think it's a pretty good app.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120]   I really like it a lot.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120]   The other one is this is embarrassing.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.120]   My friend Scott Simpson uses this phrase.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.120]   He calls it what's calling it.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:25.120]   We have actually a Flickr group called Magic Shopping Wonder Space, which is for when he and I have way over light-roomed our photos.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.120]   Everything's way too sharp and way too easy.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.120]   I've done that.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.120]   Anyway, go check out Magic Shopping Wonder Space.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.120]   Well, I have the Ultimate Magic Shopping Wonder Space.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.120]   I personally am not a huge fan of all the like, "Oh, make this look like a Lono" kind of apps.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   There's one app that if you look at my Flickr, you can see I've been doing this way too much lately.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   It's called Pro HDR.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   As you all know, in photos, there's this thing called Bracketing, where you can basically say,
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.120]   "Take three photos at these different stops, and then later on I'm going to push these together."
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:06.120]   I'm going to capture all of the highlights in this one photo and all of the shadows, I guess, in the other.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.120]   It intelligently combines them to make.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   If you've seen those awful looking things you see on Flickr Explorer, it's a cathedral and it's way too bright.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.120]   You can make that with this, but it's really cool and it's really easy.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   Pro HDR pops open and it's got modes.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   It's got an auto mode.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120]   That was done with the top.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   No, I love it.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   You get the weird thing, though, with the smoke in there.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120]   Exactly.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.120]   Those were all taken off, my daughter.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120]   Those were all taken with...
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.120]   That's in Brighton.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   Is it a single exposure in the iPhone?
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.120]   Here's what's neat.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:52.120]   They had this manual mode before where you would pick a highlight and then pick a low light.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:57.120]   Now it's got a manual mode as well. I still like the manual mode better.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120]   And you like this better than the 4.1?
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   No comparison.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120]   No comparison.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   I have to say looking at...
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   I'll go back to that one.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.120]   Okay, here we go.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.120]   If you go back to that one, I'm sorry, people who are listening to the audio.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120]   It's Leo's fault.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.120]   Notice how I brought up all the coolness in the inside and all the warmth on the outside.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:20.120]   You can even go and mess with your photos in another app and then with a couple clicks, pull them together into a photo.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120]   Oh, I see.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.120]   So you did different white balances for the outside and the inside?
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:30.120]   I don't want to do this look for the rest of my life, but it's really fast and easy and you get a much larger dynamic range,
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.120]   especially in high-contrast situations where it would be all highlights.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.120]   Anyway, it's a really neat app.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.120]   HDR Pro HDR.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.120]   Pro HDR by IAPs.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.120]   And I don't even know how much it costs.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   Buck 99.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:54.120]   You know, we were talking with Trey Radcliffe, the king of HDR about the iPhone's HDR on the radio show.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120]   He also recommended this app.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.120]   He said it's much better than the built-in for one.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120]   You put them next to each other.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:03.120]   So anyway, just very quickly what this does, it takes two photos.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.120]   It takes a photo of the very highlight stuff and the low-light stuff.
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.120]   You can do this all manually with other apps if you want.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:14.120]   But what's nice is once you've picked your highlight, you picked your low-light and you hit go, it's like Chukka, Chukka.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.120]   So you don't get the blur like you do in most, you know.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:24.120]   Anyway, I'm working on doing more subtle stuff with it, but if you just want a really interesting look,
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:28.120]   really utilizing the better sensor stuff of the iPhone, it's a really neat app.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.120]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.120]   Very good.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.120]   Andy Inato, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.120]   I'm standing carefully out of the way because I think some of you are going to guess what my pick of the week is.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.120]   Let's see how well this works.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.120]   Hang on.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.120]   Oh my God, what's going on?
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.120]   Oh no.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:51.120]   Oh my God, this special super deep head helicopter, hover and roll.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.120]   They got up, up, up, up.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.120]   Shoot at us.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.120]   Whoa, whoa.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.120]   He's dead.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.120]   All the humanity.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.120]   Oh my God.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.120]   It's, oh my God, are you okay, Andy?
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.120]   Okay, the good news is it's very durable.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   [laughter]
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.120]   That one is not supposed to happen.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:20.120]   Well, you see what you're supposed to do is, and he doesn't, by the way, he doesn't have the special protective bumper ring on it either.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   Oh, I play with this at CES.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.120]   It is so awesome.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.120]   Yeah, it's so cool.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   We lost you.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.120]   We're not hearing you, but we're seeing it.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   No, no, no, because I'm stepping.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120]   You hear me now?
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120]   Oh, you weren't on my game.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.120]   Okay.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.120]   Well, because I was trying to hold the...
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   I know.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.120]   It's too many things.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:43.120]   It's really difficult to pilot it while watching yourself on the remote screen over here.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:47.120]   What you're supposed to be doing is actually looking at your iPhone screen.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.120]   And I'm going to open it.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   You did it a little bit.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:56.120]   Folks, if you didn't watch today's show on video, you really must go to twit.tv/mbw and get the video version.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:59.120]   So, actually, I'm inadvertently showing off something kind of cool.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.120]   We're a lot of this now, so, okay, let's see.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   Backing up one second.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   It is a...
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.120]   Okay, we now know he's not wearing shoes.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   So, there's a camera on this, however.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Yeah, there's a camera on it.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   Here we go.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.120]   This is going to be just like Avatar.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.120]   It's a multi-camera setup.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.120]   Ooh.
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.120]   There we go.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.120]   Ooh.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120]   Ooh.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.120]   Okay.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.120]   So, there's a video camera on...
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.120]   There we go.
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:33.120]   There's a video camera on the helicopter.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   God, I have to hold the camera...
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.120]   I have to hold the copter steady and the phone steady.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.120]   Okay.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.120]   I have to look at either of these things.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.120]   So, you have a full control deck in front of you.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.120]   And so, you actually can steer and navigate by looking at the camera.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.120]   Not necessarily by trying to look around outside the camera, which is what I was trying to do.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:58.120]   But the cool thing is that if you do nothing, if you don't touch the controls at all,
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.120]   it uses its own logic to simply say, "What do I have to do in order to hover in position where I am right now?"
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:10.120]   So, essentially, if I simply let it hover right now and let it chew up my arm because I've got the all the...
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:13.120]   I've got the blades and now exposed.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:19.120]   It would simply sort of like bob a little bit, but it will pretty much stay where it is right now.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.120]   But there are also two controls to the left and the right of the iPhone screen.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.120]   One that's...
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   It's using one control just for elevation and rotation.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:34.120]   And the other one is for control where it's moving, where it's leaning one way or another to move around.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.120]   And it is pretty hard to damage.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   The fact that it's not impossible to damage is demonstrated by the fact that if you go to the website,
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.120]   there are lots of replacement parts available for this.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   But I've been playing with it for the past three or four days and I haven't broken it yet.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.120]   It is a hell of a lot of fun.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:56.120]   Obviously, I'm not quite good enough with it yet that I can do that really cool thing where this thing hovers
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:04.120]   and doesn't even stray one inch as it parks itself in front of the video camera.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.120]   But you see how sophisticated some of the controls are.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.120]   What it's showing me right now is that it detects...
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:15.120]   It's told the helicopter told the iPhone that I've crashed into something.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.120]   So I've turned myself off because clearly you don't know what you're doing at this point in time.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.120]   So now I have to actually hit a reset switch in order to get it going again.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.120]   I'm now going to turn it on again to see how well I can do.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.120]   I'm going to leave the room with it.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.120]   They really perfected this a lot since we saw it at CES, haven't they?
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.120]   It's become a real consumer product.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.120]   Okay, so I'm going to step away from the mic.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.120]   Let me see if I can get it to go in front of the camera.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.120]   And now Andy is stepping away from the mic to see if he can...
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.120]   Also, shop his camera in half.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.120]   Also, realize that there's a camera, there are three sets of lights, there's a microphone.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.120]   You're going to see some crashing.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.120]   This is the parrot, right?
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.120]   This is the parrot AR if you want to go for the thing.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.120]   I just want to make sure that this is the same one we saw.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.120]   It's got primes.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.120]   I'm now stepping into the safety cage.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:02.120]   So the safety shrouds are not off, by the way.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:07.120]   You're supposed to put that special bumper on it so it doesn't chop your head off.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.120]   Here he goes, he's now using the iPhone.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.120]   It's alive!
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.120]   Yeah, I was going to recommend...
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.120]   Oh, look at that!
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.120]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.120]   I was going to recommend Chopper 2 for the iPhone, which is just a virtual one of these.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.120]   So now he's really kind of...
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120]   John Boy!
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:27.120]   Now he's taking the asbestos off the ceiling and now he's in that.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.120]   Oh!
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.120]   [laughter]
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.120]   Okay, I haven't been really instrumented in this thing yet.
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.120]   That was the mic.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.120]   It's fun for you and the whole family.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120]   Yeah, how much is it?
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:45.120]   It's like $250, so it's definitely something that in most households you're going to get your four kids together and saying,
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.120]   "How many of you would like to pull together your birthday presents to make this happen?"
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.120]   It's interesting, they call it the flying video game.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.120]   I guess it is, isn't it?
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.120]   Yeah, there are a bunch of...
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   It's kind of like what you saw in the demo when you saw the YouTube video where we were at CES,
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120]   where there are a bunch of...
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   Their pads are stickers so you can get it to sort of sense its environment.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.120]   It works via a one-to-one Wi-Fi connection between...
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.120]   First, let's make sure that...
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.120]   Okay, good.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.120]   I was about to turn the camera face to you,
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.120]   but you're going to get a really good shot at my butt, maybe.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   And that probably was not going to be too good for the viewers back home.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.120]   But yeah, so you can get it to...
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:32.120]   It's a one-to-one Wi-Fi connection between any iPod or iPod touch and the helicopter.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.120]   It's a little bit...
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:39.120]   I think it inherits a lot from RC helicopter community as opposed to the iPhone community,
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:44.120]   because setting up the software is not 100% there.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   I had to debug a couple of things to get to work, but it's easy to go through the instructions.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:55.120]   Also, the only other thing I don't like about it is that the battery will last about 15 minutes,
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.120]   maybe 10 minutes.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.120]   Right now, there's a battery indicator on the phone itself,
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.120]   and it's telling me that the battery is now at 44%.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.120]   I've been running it for maybe six or seven minutes.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.120]   So it's definitely not something where you're going to be walking the dog and, you know,
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.120]   having this thing bobbing behind you as you go.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.120]   But it recharges pretty quickly.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:18.120]   It also gives you enough time to wrestle your brothers and sisters and live room sofa to figure out who gets to play with it next.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.120]   It's a hell of a lot of fun.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.120]   Boy, it's your noise.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.120]   Exactly.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.120]   It's like this was the productivity killer.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.120]   Like the day...
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.120]   I came back from Chicago, and this was waiting for me on the doorstep,
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.120]   and I'm like, "I have better cancel at lunch meeting I have for tomorrow because I have a feeling I'm going to be..."
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:38.120]   I'm either going to be playing with this or repairing a lot of broken lamps.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   The AR drone, a couple of hundred bucks, it's ARdrone.perit.com.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:51.120]   And it's all foam, so again, I've crashed this thing many times, and it's all ticked and just fine.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.120]   It takes the lick in, and it keeps on chopping.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   Exactly.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   The AR drone.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   Boy, you know, I really should have let you go last because anything I'm going to do now is a complete anti-climax to that.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120]   This is kind of an interesting iPad app.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   I was going to show it on iPad today, and then Grand Theft Auto came out on Thursday.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.120]   I should say this for this Thursday, but I'm sure something else great will come along.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:24.120]   This is a free program called ZoomoCast that lets you play audio, video, or access files over the Wi-Fi network on your iPad, your iPhone,
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.120]   or any other computer.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:29.120]   It sets up an ad hoc network that actually really, really works well.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:33.120]   So you have to run ZoomoCast on the computer, by the way, PC or Mac.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120]   Choose the folders that are available.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:41.120]   And then if I go to my iPad where I'm also running the free ZoomoCast application, I'll just tap it.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.120]   We're on the same network.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.120]   In fact, it can use the internet as well.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   You can see my MacBook Pro at home is also visible.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.120]   So here's the shared folders on here.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:58.120]   I can look at documents and access the documents, which is very handy, but I can also play back movies and music.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.120]   In fact, I'll look in my Amazon MP3.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.120]   It works with the iTunes as well.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:09.120]   It won't work with encrypted music, but you can actually play back music over your network on your iPad.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120]   What's it doing on your computer when you do that?
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   Gee, I don't know.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.120]   It's just kind of sitting there.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.120]   Wow.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   Just got a little thing running on the computer.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.120]   It's just a little stub that runs all the time.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.120]   It actually sits up here in the...
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.120]   There's a pro version, but I haven't paid anything.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.120]   This is all the free stuff.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.120]   It works pretty well.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.120]   ZoomoCast?
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.120]   Z-U-M-O-C-A-S-T.com.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.120]   Let me stop the music.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.120]   That's playing over the WiFi, but it also will play over the internet.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.120]   You'll see the videos aren't maybe quite so fast, but it does.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:49.120]   Here's one of the reasons you really would want it.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.120]   It transcodes a whole bunch of video files that will not play on the iPad.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.120]   This is an MPEG-4, by the way, and plays them.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.120]   If you have stuff in Divx or all sorts of weird things, you don't have to do the transcoding.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.120]   It does it for you kind of on the fly.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.120]   Have you used AirVideo before, Leo?
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.120]   No, it's probably similar to this, huh?
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:11.120]   Because AirVideo, though, you can transcode it remotely, but it still has to transcote it.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.120]   This is doing a lot of live.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.120]   It does it on the fly.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.120]   I was able to play back almost.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.120]   I couldn't find any video that I couldn't play back.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.120]   Now, of course, it's buffering because it's streaming a massive file over the internet.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.120]   It plays.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.120]   Actually, I think this is a format that the iPad will handle, but I tried it with a lot
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.120]   of formats that it wouldn't, including WMV files, and they play back just fine.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.120]   Meanwhile, Andy's out in the deck trying to chop.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120]   Oh, I did.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.120]   Trying to mow the lawn with his AR donuts.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.120]   Well, I just thought that, you know, I heard Dad saying that's not an indoor toy.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.120]   You might have been glad.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.120]   It looks like I can see, oh, there he goes.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.120]   Well, we're going to let-- I'm going to play my little videos on ZumoCast.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.120]   Alex is going to go do some Condo-witting.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.120]   Merlin, Merlin's going to go off.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.120]   Okay, well, do an HDR photo of my screen.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.120]   Let's see a little HDR photo of his screen.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.120]   And Andy, Andy's going to give himself a haircut.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.120]   We thank you all for joining us on this--
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   I just need some trimming for the door, but it's--
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   Unless you put them hiring a guy for 200, 50.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.120]   I actually can't wait to try that, Calvetica.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.120]   That looks pretty cool, too, yeah.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.120]   We really appreciate it.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is with the Pixelcorpixelcorpixel.com for that great guild of multimedia artists
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.120]   who are learning and working together.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.120]   It's a great place to go if you want to get those skills and get the work.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.120]   Also-- oh, see, now my video is playing.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.120]   I should stop that on the iPad.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.120]   Also, of course, Pixelcorp.tv for their podcasts.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.120]   Lots of good ones, including Mac Break, the video version.
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.120]   And I'm having lots of fun on Ping.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.120]   So I said, just Alex Lindsey.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.120]   He likes Ping.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.120]   Well, here's the thing is I used to be a music director, and there was all these songs that I know exist
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.120]   that no one else ever got to hear.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.120]   So follow Alex, so you'll hear some of them.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:52.120]   And I write little stories.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.120]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   So this is me arguing politics with Billy Bragg.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.120]   And then I give you this is the song that I would listen to if I wanted to know more about Billy Bragg.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.120]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.120]   And I have a whole bunch of them written tonight.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.120]   I just got to post them.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.120]   So are you Alex Lindsey?
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.120]   Just Alex Lindsey.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.120]   All right, well, I'm going to follow you next.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.120]   The people who are following me my deepest apologies.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.120]   I'm not doing anything like that.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.120]   Merlin Mann is at 43folders.com.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.120]   Because of course, Merlin Mann.com is another great place to go with links to every single one.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.120]   Yeah, you know, and I think I'm going to start posting again on the 43folders.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.120]   So nothing matters when we're in other, but just for what it's worth.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.120]   It's been pretty quiet as I--
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.120]   Well, you've been writing a book.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.120]   You've been busy.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.120]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.120]   I guess so.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.120]   Follow him as a hot dog-- hot dogs ladies on Twitter.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.120]   At your at your peril.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   But thanks for having me back on, Leo.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.120]   It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.120]   Oh, we love having you.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120]   Merlin, we miss you so much.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.120]   And don't forget, Merlin does the-- simply the funniest show on the internet.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.120]   It's called You Look Nice Today, and you could find it online.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120]   Those old episodes stand up fine.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.120]   While we're still making new ones.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120]   I recommend Vachina.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   I listened to--
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.120]   You know, one of my favorites.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120]   The Back to Vachina.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:06.120]   You know, I think that in fact, probably each and every fan of You Look Nice Today has a favorite that they would say, you know, if you ask them, oh, that's the one you have to be, you know, you have to listen to first.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.120]   It says a lot about the flaws in your personality, which one really appeals to you, I think.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.120]   And you definitely know where you're broken.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.120]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.120]   It's great to have you.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.120]   It's great to have you.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120]   Great to have you on.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.120]   Merlin, man, ladies and gentlemen, and of course, Alex.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:26.120]   Merlin are joined by the great Andy Inatko, who is the king of the celestial waste of bandwidth at cwob.com.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.120]   He also writes for the Chicago Sun-Times and gets to fly his little plane around all of them.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.120]   Now I have mastery of land, sea, and air.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.120]   Watch out, because he's got the high ground.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.120]   So we're all--
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:41.120]   Folks at CBS had better watch their box spectals.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.120]   We're all in trouble today.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:45.120]   I've already envisioned a multiple pinch of movement.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.120]   That's all.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.120]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
