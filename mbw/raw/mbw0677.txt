[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.760]   What is this sleep tracking feature they're talking about? School time mode and AR glasses.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.360]   There is lots to talk about. Rumors abound next.

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The last show before the iPhone 11 era has begun.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.280]   Laurie Gill is here from iMore. She's managing editor there.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.680]   Laurie, you called it. You said you were going to get the invitation Thursday and you did.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.360]   I know. I was even saying, man, if I would have only made a bet on that, I would have paid
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.040]   a little bit of money. Well, I've been giving you credit on every show saying, "Laurie Gill said
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.720]   it'd be Thursday." So you got your invite? That's enough. I didn't. I didn't. Oh, God.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.360]   I have not been invited to the iPhone 11 era. But Renee Rich, she got his invite right from
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.080]   Renee. Did you get yours, Renee? I did. I did. I missed Laurie already, though.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   I know. Lawrence just up the road. She could just go get a Renee Rich.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   I'm going to go back to what I used to do, which is I just sit around outside and wait for
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.120]   cool people to come talk to me. So I'm still going to be at this. You're going to go down there?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.560]   Oh, wow. Are the cool people. Do they let you in the door? I mean, like,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.440]   do they let you in the fence? No, you have to sit outside. That's depressing.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.200]   I said that with that puppy dog face. That's so depressing. Andy and I coz also here from
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.440]   Boston Public Radio. Hello, Andrew. Also at the library again. Yes. And Laurie, what you try to do
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   is that because this is like a San Francisco area company, there's the tradition that they upheld
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.640]   that they got from the Grateful Dead, where if you look disheveled and looks like you hitchhiked
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.760]   all the way to Cupertino, hold up a cardboard sign that says need a miracle. And somebody
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840]   who has an extra ticket will give it to you. It helps if you're wearing patchouli oil.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.280]   Yes. I don't think any of that works anymore. No, it doesn't. My house in the 70s, but not today.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.000]   Here's the invite you didn't get. I didn't get Andy didn't get Renee got by innovation only.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.240]   Okay. Now I didn't notice this, but Christina Warren did. What's wrong with this picture?
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.520]   It's an apple. It's glass, which is kind of interesting. There's only a yellow shot. There's
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.640]   only five colors. There's only five colors. And the blue is a lion. Is there purpose? And there's no
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.280]   orange? There is purple, but no orange. Green is the new blue and purple is the orange. And what's
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.440]   missing blue? The blue's there. Orange is missing orange. And then blue should be what?
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.400]   Well, the rumor is that the iPhone 10 are orange and blue will be superseded by the iPhone 11 green
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   and purple. So do you think these are going to be the colors of the phones? But there's blue
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.760]   there so they can't. This has got to be the shimmery new glowing apple logo on the iPhone 11
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.400]   Pro, which I just made up. Or could just be an invitation.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.520]   I'm going to keep going with yellow shots. Those are different flavors of yellow shots are going
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.040]   to be available in the lobby in the spaceship when you come in.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   Carsten has a theory. Tell us your theory, Carsten. All right. They haven't had a new iMac in like
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:39.520]   forever. And Joni Ive is on the way out. So they are going to their one more thing at the end
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.880]   is going to be a tribute to Johnny's first iconic design. They're going to go back to candy colored
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.680]   iMacs. The fond day blue iMac. I just want a bondy blue iMac. This kind of well because your
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:00.400]   name is Carsten Bondy. Interesting theory. That would be pretty fantastic.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.080]   It is the is the post Johnny Ive era. So I guess there might be some. Is that sort of a risky
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.920]   tagline for Apple to use? I mean like we're only a few years away from Phil Schiller saying
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.000]   not innovating anymore my ass would have been funny if it's said by courage only.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.160]   I mean they have converted the whole world to no headphone jack yet. So they could do that.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.960]   That's true. It just seems like people they're setting people up to say oh innovation only.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.880]   Honestly an iPhone launch these days is not usually particularly innovative.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.520]   Maybe it is in their eyes but fully outside world.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.480]   Internally but like who cares if it gets late like a couple of years ago you got this whole new
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.320]   custom disc controller that made sure the iPhone never dropped a frame never failed to record.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.840]   And that's like they built that from scratch but nobody cares nobody sees that.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.920]   There's innovation inside but yeah it doesn't look any different to us still looks like a slab of
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.480]   glass. Even the stuff that they innovate on the outside people still say that's not innovative.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   So they really just kind of lose all around when they use that terminology just because there's so
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.560]   many naysayers at that sort of concept of innovation. I think AirPods would be a good example of
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.440]   that. A lot of people saying that's sorry I can't do that.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.880]   Yeah we know that Siri you don't have to rub it in.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   You don't have to read my yes.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.360]   Oh you know to learn. I was just on Twitter talking about the rumors of the tile thing which
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.760]   I'm sure we'll get to and someone said oh but AirPods were so revolutionary the time and the
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.800]   tile won't be. And like I remember most people going AirPods that's garbage we don't need AirPods
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.320]   but in five years you know they'll be saying oh those tiles those were great but that next
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.560]   thing is going to be stupid. So if you go to.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.440]   Yeah I think so the idea would be that innovation would be like literally a new product that's
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.880]   never existed before and really frankly Apple has never done that. They've never
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.840]   had a new product that's never existed before. What they do is they sort of like take
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   the research of what's out there now what technology they can do and what people actually
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.960]   need in their day to day life and that's how they innovate and from the outside looking in we're
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.320]   just seeing like well this this looks like the same you know wireless earbuds for example you
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.880]   know wireless headphones had existed for a long time so it didn't seem like it was that big a deal
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.720]   but when you go deeper into what the true wireless technology really means you realize like oh that
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   actually is innovative it's just doesn't doesn't look like it for from the outside perspective you know.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.400]   Well it depends it could be it could be an Apple TV where it's like we decided we needed to have
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.960]   one of those and we're going to take this four or five years to figure out what we can do with
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.280]   one of those is interesting. We just decided that we have a hole that's in our product line the
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.520]   shape of an Apple TV and what do you know here's an Apple TV it happens to have to fill that hole
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.880]   nicely. So I don't I think that it's time to let go of the expectation that everything they're
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.160]   going to everything that they do is going to be mind blowing everything they're going to do is
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.840]   going to teach the industry how they should have been doing things. I think that it's it's hard to
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.520]   come up with it's hard to hit that kind of batting average every single season and I think it's unfair
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.200]   to demand that. But they're the ones who do ordinary fly innovation only. I mean well you know that's
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.600]   and and there they are the miserly old man wearing the high silk top hat after he knows that there's
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.000]   that there's been a it's school is up because of a snowstorm so yes we're going to make fun of
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.840]   them we're going to make mighty fun of them but it'll be okay. They're they got they got money to
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.720]   wipe off their tears. Andy that is the weirdest analogy I've ever heard you make. I had to really
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.680]   think about the guy in a top hat schools out in a snowstorm to understand that what you're talking
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.560]   about is somebody's going to throw a snowball at the top hat but I'm saying I'm saying holy cow.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.480]   When you when you find yourself picking up your crushed beaver skin top hat from the off the ground
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   walk the mark you have to say you know what I really should have seen that coming. I had to
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.040]   Kenzie and metaphor I'm impressed. Thank you very much. Like exactly what I was thinking.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.520]   Ladies and gentlemen Andy and I go you know that show. I'm here to class to join up. Yeah. Don't
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:12.000]   I look classy. You're class to join the gym up. So I guess I mean we've talked about this ad
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   nauseam this is always the worst week the week before an apple event because there's
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.120]   probably not much to say at this point that we haven't already speculated.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:26.000]   But maybe as we get closer we have more confidence in our prognostications. Will there be something
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.160]   besides iPhones watches yes probably watches right. That tile tracker or I we can't call it a
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.920]   title trailer the the finder tile like tracker. Yeah so this is another Rambo discovery.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:49.840]   Guillermo Rambo discovers these nine to five Mac in code. He found an image of a round tracker
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.960]   like object and code that sounded like you would you would have you know find my iPhone
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.600]   including augmented reality which is kind of neat that you would aim your phone around and find the
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   keys or whatever the tile was attached to. Sounds fun. That sounds great. Or what I think
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.080]   is that this sounds so much like the iPhone 7 event to me like the entire setup to this we've
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.320]   got a phone that's going to pretty much look like the other one. Yeah get an extra camera have
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.880]   some new finishes and have a killer accessory but instead of being AirPods this year it's going
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.080]   to be these tile things and they could be just rerun those that whole event with all of these
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.520]   things being added to the iPhone 10 platform now and that would make like I think an ideal iPhone
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.320]   keynote for them. This is this is a logical thing for apple to add right. This is probably another
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.720]   you know it's like services. It's not enhancing the phone per se but it's adding a new service.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.760]   It's with the Find My app and people can go buy it like they bought AirPods. It feels like very
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:57.040]   apple play. Yeah yeah it's kind of an incremental. It's also an example of that idea of not innovating
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.600]   in that on the surface it seems like this isn't an innovative feature. There's dozens of fobs that
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.120]   exist in the world right now that do the same thing but apple's probably doing something different
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.880]   adding some kind of feature that's within the apple ecosystem that makes it more you know works
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.280]   better works longer. The augmented reality idea you know the all of this like that's the innovative
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.440]   part but on the surface it's like well that's not innovative. There's already a bunch of tile
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.480]   like trackers that already exist. So there's also some evidence that those companies aren't
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.960]   doing that well. Tracker Pivoted Tile is having I think financial difficulty is not a good business.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.800]   Of course for apple it might be a perfectly fine business because it's an adjunct to something.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   And especially if they're including that in some version of services. So if it were something like
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.000]   you know for everyone who spends the ten dollars a month for their iCloud service.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.920]   This finding tracking file is included in that.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.680]   This track here. Particularly if it works just like the actual tile does be any time that your book
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.520]   bag or your bicycle is near any iPhone then that will actually log it and track it into you. That's
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.920]   in the United States and the UK at least that will be pretty pretty hot. But this is one of the
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.360]   reasons why it's fun it's recreational for me to talk and for us to talk about apple rumors.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.320]   But every single time it's like you even when you've got the whole thing the hardware the specs
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.080]   absolutely locked you don't really understand what the point is until apple tells you the story
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.800]   of here's why here's the yes it's a tile tracker but we're using it for something else or yes we
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.400]   have 3D cameras but we're not using it for taking 3D pictures here's why we put this hardware in
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.040]   and how we're going to make the most of it. They don't they don't do stuff do this sort of stuff
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.240]   without a really long ranging plan and without almost like introducing a new character into a
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.320]   story that they're telling. Yeah the other thing that's really cool though is they spent an
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.640]   enormous amount of time at WWDC and later at Black Hat describing the technology they were using to
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:09.280]   track objects while keeping the objects anonymous and the trackers anonymous and just building out
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.160]   that technology and they use the Mac as the way to sort of talk about this which is not unusual
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.640]   for apple they often talk about existing technology in place of new technology is going to come
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.200]   but it was just fascinating and if they can build out that network and suddenly all your stuff is
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.840]   tied into that network then that becomes to Andy's point like it's like the tile thing but
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.080]   they have a whole security message a whole privacy message and it ties into Asif's
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:38.400]   map apples massive deployed base of devices at the same time. It does sound like it's a reasonable
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.800]   product for apple even if other companies have had some struggles getting able to buy it it just
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   feels like it's a natural for apple. No your dogs can wear them.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.000]   And no no no that's the target market is somebody's going to be the first person to have like a
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.960]   little like red like rubber thing case you snap it into that makes it look just like when a
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.520]   spider-man spidey tracers so you can throw it like at your kid's book bag and now you're tracking
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:12.560]   your kid. Yep fine I'll make that portion myself. Here's an interesting tweet John Gruber's pointing
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:19.120]   to from Max Selaman Mac Guru 17 on Twitter it seems that apple has done a full rollback
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:28.800]   of all iCloud changes from Catalina iOS 13. Gruber retweeted and said interesting but
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.760]   unsurprising news iCloud Drive is simply far too important for it to be buggy so the improvements
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:43.520]   like pin files that were in SWWDC will not be in iOS 13. Some developers were talking about that
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.880]   last week when apple pushed out 13.1 early that a lot of the iCloud stuff become a barrier
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.960]   to them deploying they just it just wasn't working for them so it's easy to see apple. We've seen
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:59.040]   that happen before right with iCloud drive someone made a really good suggestion that apple shouldn't
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.920]   announce the new version of iOS as coming this September but just show you a bunch of features
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.320]   that will start coming in September and follow with subsequent versions over the years and that
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.920]   we give that sorry over the rest of the year and that we give them more breathing room to get
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.960]   some more complicated stuff out without having to reposition it live all the time. Absolutely
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.160]   when the coincidentally the new version of Android Android 10 is rolling up today Leo and I both
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.600]   download against we speak and one of the things I like about the way Android does updates is that
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.560]   yes this is going to be the huge infrastructure and architecture update but over the course of
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   the next year if they want to update the camera app they're going to update the camera app and if
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.160]   they want to add new features to even like the way that they draw web views they're going to be
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.440]   they're going to be able to deploy something like that in the middle so they don't have to
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.920]   work drive everybody towards making sure that you hit the September 3rd release date for everything
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.240]   they can simply say here's the stuff that we need to have ready for developers on September 3rd
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.440]   and now here is our timetable not not spreading our resources too thin but making sure that when we
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.560]   update maps it's going to be the right update and when we do this new protocol for installing apps
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.640]   without having to resubend the entire device that also is going to work correctly without us having
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.280]   to totally reset everything so I would love to see apple suddenly give us this wonderful like
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.960]   suddenly Easter present of saying oh we didn't we didn't announce this in September when we
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.280]   showed off the new version of iOS but we are pushing out an update that will now enhance the camera
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.640]   app in the following 11 guinci ways and here it and it's just going to simply be pushed out today
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.920]   that would be wonderful so they're having to wait until September we should point out Max
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.800]   Seliman is one of the leads co-founder and lead developer at Ulysses and so they're very interested
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.000]   in what the features are in fact he's actually he sounds like better for us that this time the
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.200]   rollback came during the beta I applaud that they'd rather don't ship features than ship them in a
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.520]   broken state of course because as an app developer he's the one who's going to have to deal with a
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:05.440]   broken iCloud drive Ulysses is highly reliant on the iCloud drive I think so there's that that's
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:14.320]   hard news and then there's more speculation sleep tracking maybe a part of either the new apple
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.360]   watch or an apple wash update that what do you what do you think will it will it be for the new
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:25.280]   watch only does it need tech I mean they bought bed it and bedded is a little device that you
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   that you use with the apple wash but I don't know if it needs anything extra and I forget we wrote
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.160]   it out was it Guillermo as well might have been Guillermo as well yep but you know he was saying
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.040]   you could have a day and night watch keep your old that's the problem that's the problem is the
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.200]   apple watch needs to charge and if you're wearing it at night well it would remind you to charge
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.720]   like just so you have enough juice to get through the night I think is the it's part of the so now
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.320]   you'll be charging before you go to bed and after you wake up I don't know that's all you're in
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.880]   the shower you just throw it on the charger then you get it on well it's so if it comes out if
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.160]   it's if it's a software update that's going to be available for all apple watch which of course we
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.480]   all wish that to be the case because we want that feature then then yeah you do have to kind of
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.880]   consider how often are you going to charge your watch but if it comes out with a new apple
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.000]   watch only if it's only going to be available on series 5 that leads me to believe that maybe
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.640]   they've made some battery improvements that's going to allow you to do something like this yeah
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   yeah battery battery there you go you're right we i mean if they're going to do new apple watch
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.400]   that's almost certainly one of the things they did improve is battery line but i want it always
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:44.480]   on yeah i do want it always on screen or even just fast while it's charging if you charge that
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.720]   thing but what about that what if the charging is faster on the way i mean it's fast enough that
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.320]   they couldn't use q for it i mean they built they built out their own charger because q
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.400]   wasn't going fast enough already for them right you know and also as rene keeps saying that there's
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.480]   always a cost of fast charging you have to nothing comes for free right and when you have a battery
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.600]   that's as small as that you really want to bash its brains in every single day but yeah i really i
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.640]   really think that the the next big signature feature of apple of the apple watch that apple's really
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.720]   driving towards is battery life the the ability to not have to make sure you put it on the charger
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.480]   every single night or when you wake up and you're in the shower that is still like the one the one
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:30.000]   consistent complaint of the apple watch which is the best wearable on the market today is that if
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.400]   you forget you will maybe get a second day out of it but you're certainly not going to get a second
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.840]   night out of it and it's just so inconvenient to make sure that you add that to your nightly rhythm
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.960]   to making sure that to make sure that you put this watch where it's supposed to go to charge
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.680]   every single night and every every time i test out another another fitness band or another smart
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.560]   watch i really wish that it was nicely made as the apple watch i wish it were as pretty as apple
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.200]   watch i wish it were as functional as the apple watch but the fact that some of these fit bits will
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   run for three or four days without charging that's damn compelling isn't it yeah other rumors according
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.760]   to mac rumors there's a feature in the next uh... ios ios 13 called school time this is for
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.840]   uh... ios and watch oesa do not disturb mode
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.360]   for school kids with users or parents able to customize app restrictions in the apple watch app
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.440]   for ios prior to automatic or manual activation it can be set to a trigger based on a preset time of
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:38.640]   day maybe location two i don't know um and then there's already features not entirely unlike that
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:47.040]   in in the the the parental controls anyway so i'm wondering how how does this differentiate itself
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.760]   from what already exists or is it just a renaming it's a branding the feature that's there because
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.360]   they get up on stage because what what does apple watch is now let's sell watches to your school
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.440]   kids because of this great new school time feature it's made for school right so it may be done to
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.840]   wear it i mean yeah you're listening to watch it with apple watches well but but also do you want
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.720]   your kids to uh if you if they really are getting into uh again as when he said talking about uh
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.680]   at the developer at the hackers conferences about ways of doing tracking anonymously and securely
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   by respecting privacy wouldn't be wouldn't you want to buy your kid even a two hundred dollar watch
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.640]   if they're kind of responsible if you knew that everything every they don't you're not going to
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.240]   give them a four hundred five hundred dollar a hundred dollar phone but knowing that every time
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:40.320]   that that they walk past anybody with an iPhone any anywhere in the world this thing is going to
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.760]   say oh by the way your kid was here at this time and moving towards this other phone uh about 20
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.520]   feet away that would be that would not be another really really compelling thing um the apple watch
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.000]   has been around for long enough now that they don't have to really market it as a single use product
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.560]   they don't have to tell one focus story which which we used to be fitness now they can say that
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   here is the smartwatch that you would want your kids to have because it will allow them it will
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.160]   keep them healthier it'll keep them active it'll keep them moving it'll keep them safe that's the
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.040]   way you sell two hundred fifty dollar watches uh as christmas gifts to kids here's an interesting
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:22.000]   rumor from uh meckrummers.com they got apparently got an internal build of iOS 13 which includes a
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   start tester app that can switch in and out of a head mounted mode uh lending people to think maybe
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.280]   this is uh something for an augmented reality headset there would come out windows classes be
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.320]   round i mean we don't know how to round no well rounded corners anyway there are two head mounted
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:47.840]   states for testing including worn and held an internal read me in iOS 13 describes a starboard
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:57.280]   system shell for stereo AR enabled apps they also file also suggest apples developing an augmented
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.440]   reality device code named garter that possibly is one of several prototypes under the t 288
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.880]   umbrella this is from macrummers.com i'm not sure where they got the uh this is not the public iOS
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.040]   code this is an internal iOS release yeah well that could mean anything right it's almost that's
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:23.200]   almost useful from an intel sort of status and i i keeps i keep asking myself i don't i don't know
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.560]   of any technology that is going to be really functional for augmented reality mounted in a pair
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.440]   of glasses um does me that doesn't exist i'm saying that but i'm saying that even when you look at
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:39.040]   like research papers when you look at pine sky uh patent filings i don't know of any technology
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.960]   right now that could let you have something that is it leave even passable like hey i've got
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:53.600]   i've got my uh uh i've got my my old man thick framed 1963 styled glasses on and you sort of pass
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.840]   unnoticed amongst humanity i don't know of anything that's going to make that work so either apple's
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.800]   going to pull a wonderful rabbit out of the hat or we're still talking about stuff that's way way
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:09.120]   off in the future and for now apple's happy creating AR experiences for the phone that they can then
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.320]   use to add to the knowledge base that they're creating for building a really good wearable uh
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.000]   AR device this could be like the wallaby like the wallaby was a device tethered from a pro that
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.960]   was testing iphone stuff and this could just be the code that lets you use an iphone to test future
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:32.240]   AR glasses there you go right yeah yep yep all right let's take a break uh i guess the answers
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.000]   to all of our questions will be one week from today 10 a.m we're going to change our schedule around
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.240]   a little bit no ios today next tuesday will defer that well it will be but it'll be just not in the
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:50.160]   morning we're going to start our day at 10 a.m with coverage of the apple streaming event mica
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.720]   sergeant and i will be anchoring here and commenting as we hear about what apple's announcing uh next
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:04.960]   to you doctor and oh doctor oh that'll be fun he'll be ranting and raving and that'll add some
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.080]   color to the mix literally and figuratively i think it'll be a lot of fun good uh and then
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.720]   after that right after that uh we'll do mac break weekly that'll probably be a little later than our
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.080]   usual time but not much later uh right after the apple event and i gather that rene and lory will
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:26.720]   not be on the show next week because they're gonna be i'm sorry tied up with something else we'll find
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.440]   we'll find some people to come in and all the sitting out on the sidewalk with my cup and you're
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:38.160]   patchoulio please invite me rene rene will rene will be in a pop-up optometrist studio on the apple
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.000]   campus being fitted with his new prescription for his new person but that would be awesome but
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.800]   he's not allowed to tell anybody that he's not supposed to tell anybody that they're actually apple
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:54.480]   ar lenses you want the harry potter version uh and so i'm just i'm just doing i'm just doing michael
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.920]   kane cosplay that's the only reason why i have these big glasses now and then uh right after
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.160]   mac break weekly we'll do ios today so we'll just push it to a later in the day and then security
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.560]   now is the one that's gonna have to move and that'll move to a monday of the next week we'll do
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.760]   security now a day early so just some programming notes i'm excited i think it'll be fun yeah lisa
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.600]   lisa broke her iPhone yesterday so it's perfect timing perfect time oh yeah she broke her iPhone
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:27.360]   leo yeah there's an event coming and it's pull of toilets never gets stronger than the week before
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:34.160]   now well i thought she's using mine right now uh but so because she needs a phone so and i have a
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.280]   few extras so i i gave her my iphone and uh she put her sim in it and she said oh this is so much
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.960]   faster than mine was so well they're both ten s maxes but i think she had a dud honestly yeah
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.760]   it was suffering uh for a year with it but i said well good news you're getting a new iphone on uh
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.400]   what is it'll probably be about the 20th right because the event is the 10th pre-orders probably
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.720]   that friday the 13th and that means usually shipping and arriving on the 20th would be my guess is that
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.040]   as apple superstitious are they not going to do a friday the 13th pre-order you did an ios 13 i
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   would hope yeah ios 13 on friday the 13th perfect yes yes yes yes yes i expect some word play around
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.680]   that on tuesday if they if they were really good sports they'd have tom hanks do the introduction
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.200]   and it is in his fred level like jumpsuit follow through on the following
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.440]   follow 13 on the 13th minute of the 13th hour houston we have an iphone yeah i think that that's a good
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:40.560]   actually that'd be a good bit wouldn't it yeah yeah it is mr roidress costume all right we got
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.480]   other stories there is news we'll have more news with our team in just a bit but first a word about
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   express vpn larry when you're sitting out front snarfing the free wi-fi from apples campus you might
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.040]   want to consider using a vpn to protect your privacy to protect your security don't know who
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.560]   else is sitting out there express vpn's our choice for a lot of reasons first of all it's very easy
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.320]   to use they have apps for every device one button click and you're secured you're encrypted your
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.280]   privacy is protected that's nice but it runs beautifully it's about as fast as any
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.360]   prick practically is fasted without a vpn uh... which i really love
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.040]   the other thing i like about it is express vpn's privacy policy you should read it but they just
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:32.160]   got audited third-party audit said yes they live up to their privacy policy furthermore they looked
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.480]   at this new cutting edge server technology express vpn's using to protect your privacy they call
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   it trusted server that's what express vpn's running on their servers it prevents the operating system
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.360]   and apps from writing to the hard drive so it kind of guarantees absolutely no information about your
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.720]   use of express vpn will be saved to their hard drives their servers are clean it's a whole new
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.360]   standard of privacy and security this third-party audit did look at trusted server and said yep

[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.280]   people have been complaining for some time about swelling batteries in the apple watch
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.560]   and cracked screens i remember reading a story from somebody who said the screen just popped off
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.960]   i didn't knock it or anything and apple wouldn't replace it well now they will
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.720]   apple said those screens on some watch models make crack and they are offering free fixes now
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.360]   they say under very rare circumstances a crack may form along the round edge of the screen
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.640]   in the aluminum models of an apple watch series two or three and they have a screen replacement
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.440]   program for this so that's great yeah that's why mom's and they popped off it didn't crack it
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.480]   popped off because of battery and they just replaced it right away they didn't give her
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   any static at all yeah good so the faith that it's a full policy yeah i had the same thing happen
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.640]   with my air pods when this case kind of split open and wasn't until like after they were rushing
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.440]   you give him a free free replacement pair through all i said oh mustn't spend that battery swelling
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.920]   so it's it's you would rather these devices not have these problems but when they take them seriously
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.800]   and realize that okay this was not the experience we promised our customers we're gonna have to
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.040]   just simply eat it and make sure that we make it right for these people that's the reason why
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:34.880]   you put your faith in your money apple right right good news um so if you have any problems bring it in
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:43.280]   new f a q and you pointed this out on i'm more dot com on um apples page about syri privacy
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:51.280]   and a response to the guardian article about humans grading uh syri um it's really it's
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.240]   an apology from apple which is kind of amazing almost everything that it that i was asking for
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.600]   i think all of us were asking for especially like no contractors now it's going to be apple
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.880]   employees it's opt in instead of opt out it's uh it's really like they went through and checked
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.960]   all the boxes almost like they read john grooper's piece and they said okay we'll do everything you
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   say i do feel bad for the contractors like i hope those people will be onboarded somehow i mean
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.640]   contracting in tech is horrible like i said before but that's a lot of people who had work
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.240]   yesterday that don't have work today and i hope they're taking care of some now those what 300
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:28.400]   400 people in arland yeah so the deal now is it'll be opt in um in other words it's not on by default
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:35.840]   right yes so uh i wonder how i think benn thompson a little upset because he thinks that apple's
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.680]   already behind on the data collection yeah well that i you know that's an interesting question
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:46.400]   isn't it are they greg ferro on twit this sunday was said no that's just marketing uh google marketing
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.120]   apple's not that far behind but i think anybody has used serie feels like serie is probably not
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:57.360]   quite as smart as google's assistant is that the case i i i would say that i would i would make
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   that's not as is definitely not as consistent he's his point is once you get the data uh you know you
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.040]   don't need an infinite amount of data to make your artificial intelligence products better
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.960]   you need a set of data once you've got that set you've done the training people on twitter saying
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.560]   they got an answer then i can't get it or i get an answer and they can't get it and we should all
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.320]   be getting the answer that's like my biggest long it seems like that's a server issue right
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.560]   there's different server it feels like eddy has one old server in his closet that he just never
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   turned off and one out of a hundred times we all hit it every day it's just that's what it feels
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.200]   like because yeah they said we're not going to give you that uh here's what i found on the web for
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.440]   you as much anymore yeah uh that will make me feel better but i was getting on one phone and
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.680]   not the other it's the same thing like i understand a b testing i understand server farm cdns all
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.560]   that stuff but it just if i ask humans need consistency or we fall down on the floor and start
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.720]   crying just give us a little bit of consistency yeah it is important that services like this uh
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.840]   listen to false activations that's the thing the people privacy-wise are most concerned about
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:06.320]   that syri thinks you said hey schlomo but in fact you didn't and maybe it's going to catch
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:11.600]   a recording of you uh in an unguarded moment and that's what worries people and that's really what
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:18.400]   the contractors were doing they were reviewing the false requests that was important uh apple says
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:25.120]   uh before we suspended grading our process involved reviewing a small sample of audio from
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:30.880]   syri requests less than 0.2 percent and their computer generated transcripts to measure how well
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:37.360]   syri is responding and improve its reliability for example did the user intend to wake syri
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   did syri hear the request accurately did syri respond appropriately by grading across a small
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.960]   sample of syri requests over time apple can make big improvements i'm gonna guess apple's gonna make
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:55.840]   a case when you first set up your phone or your or your home pod it's gonna make a case it would
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.280]   be really good for us if you would allow us to occasionally see this stuff and i wonder how many
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:08.960]   people will opt in yeah apple there to be as a button just a simple button i think um there's a
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.520]   mute button on google's devices and amazon's devices is that what you want exactly so that
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.320]   what yes so that would allow it would have obviously just because all none of our devices have that
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.440]   physical button but a digital version of that button right that's on control center or something
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:29.920]   like that where um if you just i i don't want to have syri listening right now so i'm just gonna
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.880]   tap this and then you can even maybe set it to automatically turn back on after an hour so that
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.760]   you can go into your meetings or something like that and feel secure that it's not going to
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.280]   accidentally activate while you're in some very important very you know private moment or a
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.920]   situation that you just absolutely don't want anyone listening in and then you can tap that
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.680]   button or maybe even just automatically have it turned back on for you so that
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.760]   under certain circumstances you can ensure that it's not being listened that your conversations
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.040]   aren't being listened to but then most of the other time you don't mind if it accidentally
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.560]   hears you you know trying to figure out how to get down the street or you know if you're if a
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.680]   show that you're watching on tv triggers it on your on your home pod or something like that yeah
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.080]   wouldn't be interesting if when you first set it up so first step a new device it just presents
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:26.560]   you with three choices choose one of these three uh syri shlomo can either uh not remember
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:34.320]   anything about you and give you only pretty much basic generic help or be syri can learn stuff about
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.160]   you and we will and we'll treat this uh whatever data collects treat it very securely and treat
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.680]   it on device i never share with apple and will give you much better uh much better answers or three
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:53.440]   if syri if syri gets confused we can actually syri can actually send that that that recording
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.800]   to apple servers where a secure trusted group of people will look at it and try to fix the problem
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.280]   which will make syri smarter in the long run and everybody smarter and just choose between those
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.560]   three and i think that most people would choose to be the mama bear though this choice in the middle
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.720]   some people would probably say no no my privacy is everything and then they'll definitely switch
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.760]   it back up to yes please learn stuff about me because this is terrible all i can do is basic
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.120]   bath with with syri right now and i think that if apple just simply says here's house here's how
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:28.800]   a voice assistant works and the only way that we can really make this work better and make it evolve
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.960]   so that's 12 twice as good uh next year as it was now is to occasionally let other people
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:40.640]   find out where syri is doing right and where syri is doing wrong you don't have you can opt out of
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.760]   this but if you would like to do that it would be uh it would really be doing us a solid thank you
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:52.560]   very much it's kind of weird that we're kind of put in this position of do you want to be a good
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:58.720]   samaritan and let us and apple already does this with send information to developers can we can we
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.880]   can we can and it's you know the funny thing is that microsoft already does do this if you set up
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.440]   windows is a fairly elaborate set of privacy controls many many choices that you have to make
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.560]   and then there's at the bottom express they got in trouble with telemetry i think and they got in
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.800]   trouble with that in trouble in the past have set up beautiful systems for not getting in trouble
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.840]   in the future yeah and but i think it's my guess it's going to put apple at a disadvantage that
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   most people will say no i think most people now are at the point where they say no i don't want
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.760]   these things listening to me well i think i think if um if they could combine
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:41.520]   andy and laurie's ideas and have something that says this is always going to be listening to you
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.360]   um but you can you hear whenever you're in do not disturb mode you can turn it off
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.440]   i i would totally do that i don't want it i bet you would leave it always in you not disturb mode
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.520]   well no no i would turn it off uh when i go to bed i think it's what would happen is you turn it
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.720]   off and you want to make a request what would end up happening is you do you have it where right now
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.920]   when you press the the sleep wake button it and hold it it's serie wakes up you just put it in that
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:17.440]   mode all the time and that i think is not going to be a satisfactory solution but some people enough
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:24.480]   i think enough people would leave it leave it on all the time that they would get better data
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.040]   i i would be one of those people that i think that would
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:33.360]   the good summaries would actually use it more often if they had an easy option to mute
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.400]   the well that's the risk right that people don't buy any of this stuff because they don't want it
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:44.000]   listening i think there's lots of people who don't have amazon echoes in the house a lot of it is
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.880]   information in control i think are the two ways you solve almost any problem you have with
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.360]   the your the customers of your technology product and so if you give them the information and tell
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:00.400]   them that no as a matter of fact not only is this microphone not on excuse me not only is this device
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.120]   not recording everything you say all the time here is why we couldn't even manufacture that if
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.680]   we could if we had to we can't we can't have this device constantly connected to the internet
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.400]   constantly sending streams of data up to up to apple we were we sell to way too many of these
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.320]   to even be able to process all that stuff we actually have just this little one little chip
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.360]   that's all it does it's a low power chip that can only recognize one phrase and when it hears that
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.800]   phrase it will nudge the CPU to wake up and start listening to what comes next p tell people how
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.080]   that works and then like larry says give them the control to say that if i want to just automatically
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:40.720]   say make sure that the microphone is off from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. every single day you can have
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:48.400]   that level of control or even if we if we still have those imagine if that if that tracker device
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.760]   the tracker apple chip is actually has a little touchpad on it so you can actually wear it like
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.280]   a communicator where it doesn't actually have a microphone in it but the fact that you've tapped
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.320]   it means i okay the device the device within range is now going now going to turn its microphone
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:09.600]   on in a way to command i i thought that would be such an easy thing cot yes i also want a button
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.000]   on that tile thing that turns uh location turns the tile off turns yes
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:23.360]   so what's going to happen because all this is so damn complicated is a death spiral for syri
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:31.280]   if you ask me well the the that's i think it's that it's it doesn't dazzle people not not like
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:37.520]   the google assistant does it but the google assistant is forget that they had on ever stop
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.440]   using it and it's over you you no longer collecting information people stop you people are already
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.920]   stop using syri how often you use syri all the time not very often and there is the two people
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.800]   but it's it's it's a system zero so every
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.640]   smart lights and stuff like that yeah yeah in fact we saw rene uh he muted his microphone and he used
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.040]   syri to turn off the light behind him right before the show began so my thing with syri is that um
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.600]   they have john june and rea there and he's rebuilt the entire team and that was just you know a few
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   months ago so it's going to take a while for to pay off but it's almost like being input zero on a
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.200]   television it is assistant zero and anytime you update an iphone like you update ios or you buy
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.720]   a new iphone apple has the chance to re-while you like to show off some amazing feature to get you
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.520]   back in so people might be turning it off they might be ignoring it it might have a huge downward
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.760]   trend but they have those moments those those moments every year where they can try and hook
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:42.080]   you back in they just really really have to see is one of those moments well there's bad news and
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:48.240]   there's good news we talked bad news last week we said many airlines are now uh preventing you from
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:55.280]   bringing your mac books in luggage because of a small number of 2015 2012 to 2015 mac books
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.640]   having problems with the batteries but the good news is you can bring your thermal detonator coke
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:07.760]   bottles on board again thank goodness thank good good job if you uh if you go to disney's attraction
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:14.800]   the galaxy's edge star wars attraction apparently coca cola is selling soda in bottles that look
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:21.840]   just like thermal detonators and the tsa was banning those and somebody said no no soda
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.640]   carbono wonka leo no banandu jedi the grenade shaped collectibles were on the no-fly list last
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:36.320]   month but the tsa it says uh the issue concerning star wars galaxy edge themed soda bottles has
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.160]   recently been brought to our attention by the general public with complete a review instructed
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:46.240]   officers to treat these as an oversized liquid they should be put in checked baggage oh great
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:53.200]   or empty to be brought as a carry-on item i don't know i can understand why the tsa did not want to
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:00.080]   see that on the x-ray of your checked luggage yeah that's yeah i want to say honey huncho
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.600]   else we all we all have weird shaped things that we put in our in our luggage and they just pull
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.480]   it out and check it so yeah but checked luggage they have to go and get it and open it's microphones
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.960]   every time for me microphone every microphone huh yeah so has the price gone up on uh apple
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:23.920]   watches airpods home pods the tariff went in effect on sunday um i guess apples probably not
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:30.320]   going to immediately jump and raise the prices but i think i i think most analysts are saying that
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.040]   for the time being apple will will basically eat the eat the cost of the tariffs the tariffs
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.560]   don't apply to phones don't apply to laptops yet that won't be be until december but for the
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:46.880]   time being they're willing to eat it partly i think because uh there's there's oh there's uh
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.960]   tim has yet to get the knife in the back from trump yet and while his suit jacket remains on
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:59.120]   trump knife uh he has the ear of the president and the ability to actually affect policy to whatever
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:03.200]   degree that can be affected so this is it just it just goes to show you the real problem with these
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.040]   uh charison yeah exactly but the real problem the real problem of all this is just the uncertainty
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.520]   of it not the tariffs exist but they don't know exactly how long is this kind of last is
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.280]   is he going to change his mind at any point uh it's just terrible it's affecting the entire
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:22.320]   electronics industry now yeah 15 percent yeah but it's not super deep yet it's just how wow is
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:29.360]   just death by a thousand pokes yeah uh airpods apple watch headphones some i max home pod and
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.800]   other products will have a 15 percent tariff apples margin is more than 15 percent on these but
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:40.960]   still i mean it's probably cutting the margin by half it varies by product and and services
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   distorted because services are almost all profit mmm there there are their margins on hardware
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.200]   are nowhere nearly what they were in 2012 right what what would you say they are i mean is it
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:57.040]   50 percent 30 percent 20 percent no in the 20 probably in the 20s uh it was as high as 35 45
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:03.520]   i think in the in the 2012 euro but it's it's gone well then a 15 percent tariff is significant
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.480]   that's a significant cut if you have a 20 percent margin or i think it's probably in the 30s now but
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.640]   still that's a lot and there's some talk that maybe they'll try and get the um the manufacturers
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.280]   like fox con to eat some of it or to share it with them but i mean there's just you it's the same
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.360]   thing as having multiple middlemen in an app store purchase there's just no money to go around
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.440]   it because not like they're inventing you money to to put it and you don't have the money either
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.400]   and apples are in particularly precarious situation because what what for years was their
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.800]   biggest advantage over other manufacturers the fact that they've got they essentially have got
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:40.240]   apple manufacturing facilities in china yes they subcontract out but they've got these facilities
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.320]   locked in and they thought that under previous presidents both republic and in democratic they
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:48.400]   thought that well there's nothing could possibly ruin the economic relationship between china and
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.120]   america uh to the extent that this is going to come back to bite us but now this has come back
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.960]   to bite them and they don't have because they're not manufacturing key components
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.800]   any place else they really have to solve this problem uh or find a way to to whether the storm
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:08.320]   for two or three years uh until uh until they can get manufacturing outside or until they're very
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.800]   very sure that whatever government that's still in place if the united states of america is still
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:18.640]   around in a couple years is going to solve this problem and realize that people are it's it's really
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:24.880]   really drawing blood across several sectors that they can't let this last and unlike pixel it's not
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.360]   in small enough quantities where you can just move it to that no key factory they are apple is rumored
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.120]   to be building factories in vietnam and other uh non-chinese locales but this is a hard i think
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.400]   just for u.s. this is yeah that's a hard thing to do and meanwhile say their biggest competitor
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.920]   for phones is sam song and well you know well again they are the company that manufactures
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.520]   everything they're based in south korea they are okay they have so many factoring and shining as well
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:53.200]   but basically to off as far as i understand just to ought to and here and there to take on some
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.080]   overhead that they don't they can't do in south korea so this could be a huge huge problem for apple
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.360]   if this situation does not mend itself well of course and this is what tim cook flew to bedminton
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.640]   new jersey to explain to the president uh you know last week the president said oh that's a good
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:15.440]   point i didn't think of that and but the uh tariffs still went into effect so um the next the next
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:21.200]   shoe drops as you said andy december 15th then it will affect in all of the apple stuff they
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:28.320]   they deferred it for the holiday shopping season yeah so this was such an important
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.000]   because we're essentially an acknowledgement that is being attacked so severely that oh well
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.920]   let's wait a couple of months to well it is yeah and it's an acknowledgement that there
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:43.840]   this is maybe more than just a bonus we're under attack by zimbonis they're coming at us
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:50.720]   hey kennady you canate it you watch you're next i've got the magic bottle cap that scares you
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.200]   with the zimbonis and keeps us safe pretty soon there'll be a 15% uh tariff on having
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.480]   rene richie on the show mo no but most of canada's foreign policy over the last few years has been
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:06.720]   to be stable as part of an allied um stance uh you know in dealing with you and that that has all
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.880]   got with we've been hit left and right because we have no idea what's going on anymore yeah yeah
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.400]   poutine tariffs are coming here come the poutine tariffs don't you touch our poutine
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.880]   you know they could announce poutine tariffs i don't think anybody'd say anything it just
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.800]   it'd just be a home so delicious oh we'll miss we'll miss that poutine i guess
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:34.720]   sorry sorry about the poutine poutine makes tourists easier to spot i think that's the reason why
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.120]   kennady is like poutine uh yeah i yeah i'd be interested it'll be interesting to watch what
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:47.280]   happens over the next uh few months yeah yeah it's interesting it's gonna be interesting
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:53.120]   development this isn't uh i just can't let this go without saying that every time i talk to people
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:59.360]   who are in charge of operations at big companies uh they all tell me that they want the biggest
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.400]   problem is that they don't know what the state of the world now is going to be in one year's time
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.800]   let alone five years time and things that they thought were going to be gospel truth that they
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.920]   made all these these plans on and invested so much time and people and money and
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.360]   is now could just simply be wiped off the books this could be a huge disaster that
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.680]   sorry but i'm preparing i'm preparing for friday's for friday's npr thing which means i've been
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.000]   spending the last five days reading about the economic impact of the tariffs so i'm sorry i'm
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.120]   sorry i'm spouting up to put the mouth it's but yes it's this is great wonderful so i'm tired of
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:40.640]   all things fine everything's fine according to a variety apple has scrapped another show they
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:48.160]   scrapped uh dr dray's show vital signs uh some time ago now they've apparently scrapped the
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:55.520]   richard gear drama bastards not moving forward at apple i'm thinking the name was part of the problem
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:02.720]   uh gear was set to star uh with howard gordon and walter lee uh to set to serve as showrunners
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.360]   and write the show it was about two elderly vietnam vets best friends who find their lives
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:13.200]   upended when a woman they both love 50 years ago is killed by a car i don't think i'm gonna miss
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:21.280]   that show but uh yeah i don't know you know part of making new content is saying no uh or
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.760]   sorry not to make was saying no what to you know Steve jobs always said that saying no is more
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.400]   important than saying yes and uh that works for shows too if you see the pilot you go
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:37.280]   the set that nobody is going to see on television yes we have to do yeah but the dark side of the tv
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:45.760]   yes uh apple pay at nine percent adoption which is pretty slow compared to venmo and the other
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:53.120]   competitors this comes from bane capital um 80 percent of chinese consumers use some form of
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:52:01.200]   smartphone payment the u.s. adoption rate is only 10 percent apple pay not in china apple pay is
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.240]   the most used for the last time so actually apple pay is apparently using china 17 percent
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:15.520]   option sorry i need cash for cash for us yeah um so but uh but this is uh in the u.s. it's also
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.440]   a kind of a laggard pay pals used by 44 percent of american consumers i should point out pay pal
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   owns venmo which is probably what is consuming the bulk of that credit card and cash 80 percent
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.080]   79 percent i wonder if the apple card is going to change that i find myself using apple pay a
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.840]   lot more because i want to see what color it'll turn the card i think one of the the biggest
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:45.680]   problems with mobile payments in the united states has been the cost prohibitive nature of
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:52.720]   changing over to a new terminal system that supports it and it it hasn't been a federal
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:53:00.800]   requirement to have the chippin pin card in the u.s. up until very recently and so just they're
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:07.280]   just now starting to switch over to terminals that support that sort of thing and i think that has
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:14.240]   a lot to do with why the u.s. hasn't switched over to this sort of complete acceptance of mobile
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:21.280]   payments like other countries have there's another reason uh according to bane people like rewards
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:29.520]   so something like the starbucks card is is you is heavily used 23.4 million people because of the
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:35.920]   free coffee you get and other credit cards so having an i think this kind of explains why apple
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:43.040]   card was very important uh to apple because it's those reward people it says consumers are unlikely
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.880]   to stray from the rewards that have become part and parcel of the credit card experience but you
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:55.600]   could connect any credit card to apple pay and use that sure people will kind of still use their
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.880]   you'd have to really want to use apple pay to do that i could just use the credit card
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:07.280]   right but but my argument is that my argument is that if if people weren't using mobile payment
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   systems just because they wanted the rewards from their credit card well that's not really true
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.000]   because you can just attach your credit card to your mobile payment system like apple pay but
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.160]   that's an extra step that nobody's going to do you gotta remember people don't do stuff or when
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:26.800]   if you first step once you've done it but i mean i just you know i honestly think people just go
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.200]   now i'll use the credit card i don't think they think though well i could be off the apple pay with a
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.440]   credit card and i could get the rewards i don't think they think that i don't think that's how i
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:42.240]   i think it's just a a matter of not being ready for it yet not not being familiarized with this the
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:48.320]   the way mobile payment works with these terminals at at stores and things like that i think you know
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.880]   i i hear what you're saying definitely that um the it's easy well i'll just whip out my credit
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.960]   card that i always use my physical credit card and i'll stick i still do that all the time
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:02.080]   right and i was at the gas station the other day and it had apple pay i thought oh that's cool
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.560]   and i was going like this with my watch nothing happens so i what i do i pull out my credit card
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:11.440]   which is another problem that apple pay for a long time hasn't it still doesn't work that well
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:18.000]   and watch but it hadn't worked as smoothly it does now oh it's so it's much much better um because i
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.720]   would argue leo that i pull my phone out and touch two buttons and i'm done and that's with any credit
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.000]   card or my bank card apple apple pay works that well when i use terminals that support it to me
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.320]   that's easier than whipping out the credit card but not everybody knows that and i think that's
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.600]   part of the process that we just haven't familiarized ourself within the united states as much as some
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:45.200]   other countries especially china has familiarized their system with the mobile pay way of kind of
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:50.400]   using your your device to make the payment instead of your card to use the payment right yeah and
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.600]   let's not let's ignore the fact that the banks that the banks aren't doing or aren't doing their job
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:02.080]   because they can't they apparently haven't figured out how contactless payments will save the banks
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:09.600]   and those institutions money remember when when my bank network started being able to accept
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:18.640]   check check deposits through the atm they hired people to stand near the atms and explain to people
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.800]   how to about works that's how much money that they are safe yeah they're incentivized because
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.720]   the fewer people they have to hire to work inside those branches and the fewer branches they have
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:32.160]   to keep open the better for them so they're incentivized to get everybody to learn how to use this new
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.160]   to this wonderful new technique and then next to well now i'll just take a picture of the check
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.400]   with your phone which i love but again it's something that you have to explore your phone app to know
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.480]   that you have to be able to do but they are interested in putting up that alert to tell you to do that
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.920]   because it saves the money once they figure out that apple pay or google pay or any other sort of
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.320]   electronic payment service is going to save the money that's when you're going to see you're going
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.920]   to get this new pop-up video in your banking app that says hey have you why pay with cash why not
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:08.000]   just why not just bay bank get to blanket to somebody if you really have to put a lot of this liability
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.880]   at the feet of the banks that don't do all these cool things that are eminently possible but they
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.120]   don't find themselves in a position where it's going to benefit them personally so they don't really
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:24.240]   care about it we're in we're engaged users and i think yeah we overestimate how much the you know
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:30.080]   how much normal people care about this stuff and are willing to take one step off their beaten path
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.400]   it's funny though because when i started when the stuff first came out a tap to pay has been
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.120]   ubiquitous in Canada for over a decade and when i first started using my watch to pay i got really
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.840]   funny looks what is that well how did you do that and then like within about six months i would go
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.520]   to these places and the cashiers were all wearing apple watches and they'd hold them up to me go
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.960]   ha ha you know and so it does change it's just i think the u.s. is in a unique position where you
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:57.280]   know sort of like mobile first you guys had copper wires and then other continents went straight
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:03.200]   to mobile or we had mainframes and other markets went straight to mobile or to laptops america
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.360]   has had such an intranspirational banking system that it's not natural for people to do that and
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:12.880]   their whole hurdle to um to advanced modern payment mechanics i think is is slowing down the
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:20.720]   like the digitization of it as well yeah because ours was like instant there is a change coming to
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:28.480]   Catalina more important than dark mode apple is going to stop for a long time i one of the things
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:35.760]   i used to say was so great about macos is it came with python ruby and pearl built in uh three big
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:40.960]   scripting languages that any programmer knows the problem of course was that apple never had
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:46.160]   up to date versions of any of those languages so if you cared about it and used them you'd always
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.960]   install new versions of them anyway apple has announced that they are going to deprecate
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:59:00.640]   the runtimes for python ruby and pearl and future macos is uh this is very similar to what they've
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.680]   been doing with the macos server stuff um in the development environments where they originally
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.360]   you know they were they were not really keeping up they provide everything but it was a version
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.840]   behind and it was fine for people who didn't want to go to the repos and do the work themselves but
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.600]   super annoying for the people who did because it was extra stuff and i think they've just
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.480]   decided that if you are that keen on these things you are going to go to the repos and get it directly
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.440]   yeah yeah kurtis wilcox running for tidbits points out that first of all it will be post
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:33.120]   katalina not katalina but points out that apple has at times deprecated long standing components
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:41.200]   without removing them entirely apple uh put launch d in uh in tiger yeah deprecating cron but cron
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:47.360]   ten macos versions later is still humming along so doesn't necessarily mean these these are going
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:52.880]   to disappear it's not so much that people who use them yeah it's you know every but i if you're
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:58.960]   a programmer you're using home brew or apple ports or something mac ports or something and you're
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.720]   you're in i mean the first thing i do is update all three because i don't want ancient versions
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:11.520]   of any of those uh on there but uh maybe users who rely on script i don't know maybe users who
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:17.120]   rely on scripts who aren't programmers might be affected i think this is just a warning a warning
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.640]   shot i don't think it's going to make too big of a deal but i'll mention it um you can actually and
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:28.400]   and and willcox has a really nice one liner that you could paste in to terminal to see if you have
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:35.280]   any applications that use scripts in pearl python or ruby uh to know if this is going to impact you
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.560]   and if it is some of the things you can do he also points out swift can be used as a scripting
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:49.920]   language there is no swift runtime with macos but perhaps that's where we're headed um is replace
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.760]   those three with a swift runtime and i think that'd be a very interesting thing
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:59.920]   lot of a lot of absolutely written markdown and swift yet oh that's what we need come on john get
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:06.400]   to work there's uh i think john is no longer the steward of markdown he invented it but Gruber
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.640]   doesn't their libraries of and there's all sorts of different he has the canonical initial
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.920]   implementation exactly that's all that matters but there are there are some pretty hefty interesting
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.640]   markdown uh variants out there i use the for i have a note taking app i use called joplin that uses
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.320]   githubs flavor of markdown which i like a lot and then there are additional plugins you can use
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.520]   it really give it all sorts of wild i'm more editor is multi-more down but i forget the exact
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.560]   flavor i really like markdown more the more i use it the more i like it you know i didn't see the
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:45.440]   value when it was just uh you know easy way to do bold and and and big text and italic but now that
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.600]   because of github i can put code in my um markdown and it's blocked out as a code block and it even
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.440]   does syntax coloring and that's really awesome so there's some nice reasons to use it so all so
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.000]   all of your articles are submitted in markdown yeah i mean it's so much cleaner than when people
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.040]   were pasting it in from like words HTML generator and uh and some of the rich text editors and
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.000]   stuff and you'd never know what was causing the error in the 300 span blocks they inserted in
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.280]   every sentence yeah worth learning markdown it's easy to learn it is yeah yeah all right let's take
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.640]   a little break and have some more uh news and just a bit our picks are still coming up as well
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.680]   our show today brought to you by zip recruiter we just hired somebody using zip recruiter i think
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:36.000]   our new production assistant zip recruiter solves all the challenges of hiring hiring is hard hiring
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.720]   is important your company is made of the people you hire but it's challenging to find that right
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.240]   person let's assume you've got an opening and you know somewhere out there in the world the perfect
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:52.000]   person's waiting looking for a job looking for your job but how do you reach them well zip
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.280]   recruiter starts by posting to more than a hundred job sites that's fantastic because you know you're
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:03.120]   casting the widest net and that includes twitter and facebook but then it does something really
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.600]   amazing it has this great interface see one of the problems is you you may not want to post
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.520]   100 job sites because then you got to check a hundred job sites or you're going to get phone
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.560]   calls and your email box is going to jam get jammed not with zip recruiter they post the sites
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.520]   all of the resumes all of the applications rolled into the zip recruiter interface not your inbox
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:27.440]   not your phone they pre uh format the resume so it's easy to scan them you can also have screening
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.880]   questions to eliminate candidates that just aren't right for the job multiple choice yes no even
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:39.760]   essay questions and and then with zip recruiter's powerful matching technology once they know about
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.560]   your opening they scan thousands of resumes they have on file to find people with the right experience
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.320]   and they invite them to apply to your job as the as the applicants come in zip recruiter analyzes
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.880]   each one spotlights the top candidate so you know exactly where to start in fact it's so good
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.840]   and this has been our experience four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter get a
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.960]   quality candidate through the site within the first day it's why we use it because often within an
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:13.360]   hour or two we'll have three or four great applicants right away mac break weekly listeners can try
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:21.440]   zip recruiter for free right now but you've got to go to zip recruiter.com/macbreak zip recruiter.com/macbreak
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:26.000]   we're big fans we use it all the time just hire a production assistant through zip recruiter
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:35.520]   zip recruiter.com/macbreak zip rec r u i t e r zip recruiter the smartest way to hire
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:44.400]   apple let's see apple apple apple well maybe we can mention some google apple google project
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:52.000]   zero on thursday okay i want to okay i want to hear what you say about this okay so the project
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.160]   zero is a very important security research facility at google they've their their goal
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:06.080]   is to eliminate zero days they enbir on project zero writing um at the google blog
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:14.560]   ios exploit chains found in the wild earlier this year and this was back in february they're
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.600]   writing about now because it's all been patched apple google's threat analysis group discovered a
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:27.120]   small collection of hacked websites doing something they called indiscriminate watering hole attacks
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:34.960]   against their visitors using a series of iphone zero days now normally with the iphone the zero
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:41.200]   days are used in a targeted fashion governments collect them use them to go after particular
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.880]   dissidents or spies or whatever in this case they said there was no target discrimination simply
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.080]   visiting the hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack your device if it was
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:58.720]   successful install a monitoring implant we estimate these sites receive thousands of visitors a
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:04.880]   week further analysis from tech crunch made it sound like these sites were actually
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:12.240]   were somewhat targeted towards uh... weger muslims in china and that would make sense because it
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.440]   would have been a state actor china uh... trying and and they've done this in other ways in the past
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:24.240]   trying to track muslim dissidents in china the weegers uh... and that would kind of confirm
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.280]   sort of what this is the thing is the it's the it's an interesting
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:33.920]   series of exploits fourteen vulnerabilities across five exploit chains
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:41.200]   seven for safari five for the colonel in two separate sand box escapes affecting all iphones
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.320]   from ios 10 to ios 12 now they did report this to apple
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.120]   on february first they gave them an unusually short deadline a seven-day deadline but you may
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.760]   remember an out of band update twelve point one point four which came out one week later that's
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.960]   that's what that was all about uh... they shared complete details with apple
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:09.840]   this this is a series of posts detailing the five privilege escalation in exploit chains
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.840]   a pretty serious attack
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.880]   yep
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.800]   now you said oh god why did you say oh god
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:22.480]   so there there's an issue with this and that is for uh... there now i don't buy into this personally
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.120]   but there is a school of thought that google uses project zero as a way to sort of diminish the
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:33.440]   reputations of competing operating systems primarily windows also ios and i just think that
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.920]   there are a bunch of nerds and they found they found this was incredibly exciting but when people
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.400]   started reporting on this they started reporting like a billion iphone units have a reason to ditch
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.800]   yeah um iphones or massive iphone and what google project zero did not do was provide any
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.960]   context with this initial report they didn't say which sites had this exploit these expo
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.480]   well two things they didn't say like they said it was indiscriminate watering hole but it
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:02.880]   but being in in shanjiang for a muslim community is not being on like youtube or being on amazon
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.880]   and people were panicked my mom called me and that's my barometer for mainstream panic when my
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.600]   mom sees it on bbc or something and calls me because she thinks her iphone has been hacked
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.640]   that to me is a is a big deal and the other thing they didn't do was say that the tack also
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.280]   affected windows and it also affected android we've had subsequent reports i forget which site did
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:26.640]   the report on sunday but there was a really good deep dive and way up on their list was a binary
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.320]   attack against android and a specific oauth attack against google apps and project zero didn't
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.040]   mention any of that and for me it's problematic because project zero is owned by google so they
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:43.120]   have to go out of their way to make sure that there's no sort of impropriety um about the way
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.840]   they do disclosures and i'm not saying they have to blog all this stuff because their time is limited
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.720]   but when they do blog it and when it has provocative headlines i feel like it's super simple in the
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   very big in the introduction to say a watering hole attack in a in a small market in you know
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.840]   and they don't have to say china in in some part of the world that affected windows and android
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.440]   and ios users and oh by the way we think the ios part was particularly interesting so we're
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.640]   gonna blog about that and then the million of people who reblog it can't just say oh iphone
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:19.280]   attack you know go burn all your devices we're all doomed now they would say like as part of a
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:25.120]   large attack against this population here's the ios part of it so i think i think it was a um
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.920]   i think it was bad for project zero and it was definitely bad i did i did a video
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.520]   once as far as to call it an attack on on iphone users but you know that
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.160]   they cannot continue to operate this way unless they become independent from google
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   that's a very good point it was somewhere in between a targeted attack on a dissident
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:51.120]   and a mass attack on all iphone users it was kind of a targeted mass attack you have to be like
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.400]   you'd have to be someone who would go to those websites well it could have been you and me if
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.120]   we would go to a website that was popular with weger muslims it's not that we wouldn't be attacked
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.520]   yeah absolutely but that's a very niche compared to the way it was reported initially
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.360]   by the companies that yeah shouldn't have scared your mom yeah shouldn't have scared your mom
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.320]   uh but it is and it is and and by the way the wire i think one of the headlines you probably
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.000]   didn't like was the wired headline from Andy Greenberg and lee hay Newman who are usually
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.320]   very good writers on security mysterious ios attack changes everything we know about iphone hacking
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:29.360]   for two years a handful bunch of info sec nerds and they were like immediately um this took 14
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:35.040]   14 vulnerabilities across four exploit chains that that is an incredible amount of work to get
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:40.160]   into this that's not oh it changes everything that's wow did these people really want to get in yeah
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.840]   and by the way these are expensive attacks often these vulnerabilities cost a lot of money to get
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:52.240]   from uh three million for a zero day yeah so yeah it has to be a nation state that is strongly
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.840]   incented and yes it could be a mass attack in a targeted fashion if it's targeted against a uh
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.920]   a subgroup you know like weger muslims weger muslims that uh that you know the state doesn't like
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.720]   there are plenty of amazing attack nothing against the attack part is just it scared
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.080]   when apple is not the most popular operating system but boy are they the most popular headline
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:21.600]   right yeah so i did not know and i i never saw this that your your contention that these attacks
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.480]   also affected windows users and andrai users yeah it was a follow up to tech crunch it was reported
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.280]   by forbs not i keep saying it's not the terrible forbs contributor network but actual forbs forbs
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.160]   which does good security work they reported it and then vex vexallion did a deep die of
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:41.040]   report that came out yesterday that had a whole list of them and there was several major attacks
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.000]   against google included in that that were nowhere to be found on project zen that is interesting yeah
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.280]   yeah i i agree 100 with what uh rene was just saying uh the the only the only
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.480]   subscript that i might add is that it is important to make sure that we point out when there's a
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:06.160]   vulnerability or a proven attack on apple hardware since apple still does still tries to make a little
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.320]   bit hey by saying that hey we are the most private we are the most secure excuse we are more private
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.520]   we're more secure than our competitors i just i just don't want people to think that hey i'm
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.200]   I'm absolutely protected because I've got an iPhone.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.880]   It means that you're less likely to be targeted.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.520]   It means that if you are targeted
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.280]   that attack is less likely to go through.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.000]   But that said, that is just a parenthetical to my agreement
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.720]   with what Brilliant is saying.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.560]   Google's work is really important.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.960]   It's, they're two-in-the-lords work in some way, shape or form,
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.960]   but does it mean that you can't find a political edge
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.680]   to finding and to the way that you announced
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.000]   that you found a really interesting vulnerability?
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.840]   - Yeah.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.600]   Yeah, Sophos Naked Security Blog says that,
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.400]   yeah, it looks like it's not merely Apple.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.640]   So interesting, all right.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.320]   - And again, just add that in the introduction sentence
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.480]   and that way it shapes the entire narrative
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.720]   for all the coverage that's falling off.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.680]   - Yeah, it's very different, yeah.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.680]   And it's also because it becomes like a crying wolf thing.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.920]   And we've seen a lot of these headlines.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.320]   iOS Security finally defeated and it turns out
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.880]   that yes, if you deal, break your phone,
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.960]   you're in China and you download cracked apps
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.680]   from this specific Chinese app store,
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.120]   they're totally getting into your phone,
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.960]   but that doesn't correlate to the headline.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.760]   And one, there may be a really dangerous vulnerability
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.680]   and we need to not have been dead into it
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.160]   by a bunch of really sensational headlines.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.400]   - Yeah, but that is endemic.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.960]   That is a sensational headline
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.360]   no matter what the platform is.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.840]   And it's not unique to Apple.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   Oftentimes you'll find another headline saying,
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.920]   study found that over 80% of all Android apps
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.640]   are infected with malware saying, okay,
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.240]   if you include everything that all the side loaded,
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.280]   available apps and all the alternative app stores
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.120]   that are not protected,
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.640]   but not overseen by Google,
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.120]   if you only include the places where people
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.760]   are likely to get Android apps from,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.160]   that is down to a camera with the last number it was,
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.520]   but it was a single digit or less,
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.760]   I'm sorry, less than a single digit.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.840]   - I do have to point out that this is from
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.360]   Thomas Brewster at Forbes.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.680]   He quotes sources who said,
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.200]   speaking on the condition of anonymity that Google
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.520]   and Windows were also targeted,
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.440]   but I haven't seen any other subsequent confirmation
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.000]   or analysis. - I just added in
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.280]   in the show notes.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.920]   - I mean, I've seen, so okay.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.320]   - Well, that's the wrong one, sorry, that's a YouTube video.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.000]   It's Alexian, did the deep dive.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.600]   - Alexian, okay, so let me look at that.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.360]   - Alexity, sorry, Alexity.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.200]   - All right.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.920]   - But again, I absolutely do not want to downplay
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920]   what Renee has said,
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.000]   'cause I agree 100% with what he's saying, yeah.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.720]   - I think part of one of the,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.280]   maybe problems are reasons why we might see
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.840]   a little bit more headline-y stuff
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.600]   when it comes to things like privacy and security,
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.280]   though, is in a way, apples fall
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.680]   for being so private and secure
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.040]   and making all these statements,
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.720]   they stand on their soapbox of how,
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.560]   look how private and secure we are.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.960]   So there are going to be people who are gonna,
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.360]   it's their goal to knock them down a peg,
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.120]   and that always happens whenever somebody
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.160]   sort of can stand and make a bold statement
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.920]   and stand behind their statement.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.400]   There's going to be people who are gonna put that down,
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.840]   like to use a weird analogy,
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.840]   but you'll get what I mean by that.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.240]   A vegan might just say,
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.360]   I'm healthier because I'm vegan, I donate meat,
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.800]   and I don't support eating animals,
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.560]   but then if they're wearing,
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.320]   or maybe there's a picture of them wearing a belt
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.920]   from 10 years ago or something like that,
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.920]   made of leather, then all these people will say,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.000]   "Oh, you're not really a vegan, look at you,"
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.760]   or even something so simple as,
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.320]   yeah, but you're so sickly
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.040]   because you don't eat any kind of protein.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   It's a similar idea of when somebody's kind of saying
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.640]   something or doing something that you feel
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.000]   somehow attacked by or something like that,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.800]   you want to knock them down a peg,
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.320]   and I think that's part of why we get so many
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.320]   major headlines that are just really off the mark
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   but are attacking Apple when it comes
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.320]   to privacy and security stuff.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.080]   - Yeah, if I can just add one thing,
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.920]   you're still kind of new as a member of the panel,
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.200]   so I'll let this go, but weird analogies
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.640]   are really kind of my stick.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.120]   (laughing)
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.400]   - Can you put a top hat in there somewhere, Laurie?
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.000]   Just take some of the air out of my balloon,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.120]   as I'm saying.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.280]   You do you, you do you do you do you do you do you do you do.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.600]   - No, I think all of that is true,
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.040]   I just think because Google owns Project Zero,
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   they need to go out of their way to make sure they're--
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.880]   - Okay, I'm gonna be, I want to make sure we're fair on this.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.040]   We had reported on an earlier attack
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.080]   against the same Uighur diaspora using an app
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.560]   that was put on people's phones
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.320]   when they came into the airport in that area of China.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.760]   That's one of the things that this
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.080]   Philexity Analysis is talking about.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.840]   Mobile device users running Android OS
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.520]   targeted via an exploit that will deliver
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.600]   a 64-bit ARM executable.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.280]   We have mentioned this previously,
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.280]   so these, I think these attacks are,
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.560]   what they're talking about is,
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.880]   and this is what Philexity does by the way.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.520]   They're not exactly a security firm,
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:31.520]   they focus on NGOs attacking activists and dissidents.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.200]   And so what they're talking about in this article
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.800]   is absolutely a wide spread,
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.800]   wide ranging series of attacks on Uighur Muslims,
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.120]   including this Apple Zero Day,
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.920]   but these aren't necessarily all the same time
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.520]   or the same methodology.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.520]   So Android mobile users were targeted in mid-August,
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.400]   also on websites of the Uighur Academy,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.720]   Turkestan Press, Turkestan TV,
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.400]   loading code in an iframe.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.520]   - Yeah, that's all I'm saying is provide that context
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.080]   because then it gets reblogged accordingly.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.560]   - Well, but I think the zero-day folks
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.600]   were talking about a specific zero-day.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.760]   They weren't talking about a campaign
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.240]   by any government against any minority.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.160]   The Volexity is talking about a widespread campaign,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.000]   but not a specific flaw is what I'm saying.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.080]   And so I think it's hard,
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.120]   I understand what you're saying,
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.760]   but I don't think it's at all clear
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.240]   that the Google folks were trying to focus
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.800]   the attention on Apple again, away from Microsoft.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.840]   - I don't think it was a really clever hack.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.400]   - They were talking about a specific zero-day
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.120]   and a specific chain of attacks.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.360]   Yeah, and so if you look at this Volexity post,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.120]   it's true that Gmail has been targeted via OAuth and so forth.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.920]   But that wouldn't have been in the scope
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.240]   of the zero-day post to be frank.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.120]   I mean, that's just a separate attack.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   - I can only say that my interpretation
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.000]   of what Renee was saying and why I agree with it so readily
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.240]   wasn't that it was Google's security
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.680]   is doing anything operational,
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.840]   but more like they are,
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.160]   they should be more aware of the responsibility they have
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.560]   to make sure that they,
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.000]   the trust that they have earned in the security community
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.240]   is partly because they are trying to help everybody
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.440]   who uses a computer everywhere on the internet.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.120]   And that cause is not helped when they create a report
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.040]   through and through carelessness.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.320]   I think this is just through carelessness
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.160]   seem to underscore something that they find interesting
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.560]   about it when an outsider would think well.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.680]   - No, but I don't think it was carelessness.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.120]   I don't think the scope of theirs report,
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.920]   they didn't even mention Uighurs or any group.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.880]   They were talking about an exploit chain
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.240]   and that's all they were talking about.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.600]   It's appropriate for a select city
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.760]   which has a political component to say,
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.560]   yes, this exploit chain is part of a larger attempt
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.040]   to discriminate against Uighurs,
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.320]   but honestly Google didn't even mention that.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.000]   That wasn't what that post was about.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.040]   I don't think in any respect they were lax
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.920]   or inadvertently left out stuff they should have left in
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.160]   'cause they didn't even bring up
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.880]   who this was a targeted attack against.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:09.720]   - That was part of the problem
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.200]   because you think it could be you at that point
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.240]   rather than sitting in contact.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.840]   Even as a reader, I would be like,
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.880]   oh my God, but if they said it was used
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.760]   against a small population in this area
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.720]   or in websites, then I would go, oh.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.480]   - But they were clear that they told Apple about it
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.200]   in February, they waited a long time,
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.960]   they waited eight months to reveal this.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.960]   They said it was patched in February,
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.080]   it's no longer a threat.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.040]   I don't think that was the intent of the blog post.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.600]   I don't think that's what they were talking about.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.680]   - Again, I don't agree.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.600]   - And I don't want to--
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.440]   - It would be.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.800]   - In any way, any more line intention
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.560]   on the part of Project Zero Day,
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.880]   I think that these guys have done great work.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.320]   They have exposed flaws in other operating systems,
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.680]   including their own many, many times.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.600]   - Yeah, I don't think Renee was implying the same thing either.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.120]   At least from my ears, I didn't hear that.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.600]   - I want their reputation maintained
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.560]   by having that extra layer.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.680]   - I would also say it would be useful
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.920]   in terms of people having this in context
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.440]   to know that the Muslim populations in China
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.440]   are amongst the most technocratically abused groups
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.400]   of any country in the entire world.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.320]   Some of them are, in some regions,
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.760]   they really are treated like,
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.080]   we know that the attitude of the government
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.920]   is that we know that you are terrorists.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.320]   We know that you are planning to bomb and kill people.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.640]   We just haven't caught you yet,
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.360]   but don't worry, we're gonna get you soon.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.160]   And there seem to be, with all the crackdowns they do
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.880]   and all the limitations they put on travel,
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.760]   on information on--
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.560]   - Well, they have concentration camps
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.680]   where a lot of Muslims are in prison--
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.080]   - Because they're Muslim.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.240]   - Re-education camps, which are masked
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.680]   as job training centers.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.720]   So that doesn't mean that this stream of events
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.400]   that would cause a security breach
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.960]   is not possible to do elsewhere,
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.000]   but it just goes to show you that when you have a government,
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.720]   a, one, a government which has incredible resources
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.720]   and B, are incredibly motivated
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.960]   to attack a certain surface that surfaces.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.600]   14 steps is not, is jump change to them.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.760]   - That's the takeaway really is,
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.240]   whether it's a targeted attack against a single dissident
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.800]   or a mass attack against a minority group,
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.320]   these kinds of attacks take huge resources.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.360]   They take a nation state to perpetrate.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.320]   It doesn't mean you couldn't have accidentally been pulled in
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.040]   if you're a high school kid doing research
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.280]   on the weekers, you might well have been attacked by it.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.040]   - And it also doesn't mean that our own government
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.680]   couldn't be using the same things to keep eyes on people
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.000]   that they can't get a warrant on yet,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.040]   but they have the brief to say that,
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.920]   well, because this is an security issue,
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.960]   we can actually do this, so we're gonna do this not,
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.600]   and try to make sure that people don't know
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.440]   that this capability exists.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.960]   - Consumer report says,
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.760]   the galaxy buds are better than the AirPods.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:55.600]   - Pump on it.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.440]   - Pump on it.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:07.040]   (imitates
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:07.880]   sound)
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:11.200]   - At the time I got them with my Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.920]   they're much more comfortable,
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.120]   and they also don't drip out of here.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.280]   So I don't completely disagree.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.960]   There is a certain convenience factor
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.680]   of the AirPods that just can't be beat,
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.080]   although if you're using a Samsung phone,
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.960]   it's interesting, the Galaxy buds do exactly the same thing.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.320]   You open up the case, it's a battery charger case,
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.600]   you open it up, the phone pops up a card saying,
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.160]   ah, you're pairing these, so it's very, they're clearly copy.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.120]   - The consensus I've heard is that they people like
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.960]   the design and the sound, but the rain drop,
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.280]   the droop down on the AirPods helps with the talking.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.960]   If you were someone who still talks on your phone,
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.800]   which is not everything.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.120]   (laughing)
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.200]   - And also, remember that we're comparing
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.680]   like the Samsung buds came up with
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.320]   a year and a half, two years after AirPods.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.200]   So I really can't wait to see what Apple
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.640]   is gonna follow up the original AirPods
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.080]   with beyond where I was charging,
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.800]   because they, with the, remember that the first set
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.720]   of AirPods, it wasn't that, hey, look,
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.080]   they've got Bluetooth headphones,
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.760]   it's that it was the first truly wireless set
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.320]   of Bluetooth headphones that actually really worked,
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.240]   where you didn't have to have, you know, a plastic head
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.840]   in order to make sure that both of these
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.480]   are working correctly.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.840]   So I can't wait to see what they will do
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.480]   with another couple of years with engineering
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.880]   and these things.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.960]   - I do have to say that any buds that seal your ear
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.080]   better than the AirPods, which don't seal your ear,
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.640]   and that includes not only the Galaxy buds,
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.080]   but the Jabra in ear monitors,
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.160]   they all sound much better than Apple's AirPods.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.640]   And you can wear them a lot,
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.680]   at least in my experience, I can wear them a lot longer.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.520]   Go ahead, I'm sorry, Lori.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.440]   - I was just commenting on PowerVee's Pro,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.320]   and I know that's not AirPods, but there you go.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.800]   - They're more comfortable too, aren't they?
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.480]   - Much, much better sound quality.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.080]   - Yeah, because they seal, right?
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:53.920]   - They have more comfortable.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.880]   - They have tips, they have different tips, yeah.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.560]   That to me is a much better design.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.280]   So many AirPods have been lost
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.640]   in the New York City subway tracks in recent months.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.280]   The MTA is considering initiating a public service announcement,
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.720]   urging computers to refrain from taking AirPods on or off
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:14.880]   while exiting or entering trains.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.680]   - I know you have a breakthrough product, Leo.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.040]   (laughing)
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.600]   - By the way, this is an image that Ashley Mayer put a broom
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.360]   and a duct tape together and was able to recover her AirPods,
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.880]   and a little bit of other schmutz.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.600]   - Would you really want them back at that point?
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.440]   - No!
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.400]   - Yeah.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.280]   - She needs to have them in an auto place.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.680]   (laughing)
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.720]   - What the MTA really should do is that,
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.280]   I think what's the 34th Street Station Complex?
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.240]   They've got these little tiny little bronze,
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.160]   like ball shaped gnomes here and there.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.240]   They should, every time they find one,
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.720]   they just glue them into the ears of these little gnomes.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.720]   - We'll find them.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.680]   The journal interviewed MTA maintenance supervisor,
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.120]   Stephen Duginski.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.080]   - Duginski says that a transit worker's use a pole
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.280]   that extends about eight feet
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.000]   and has two rubber cups on the end
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.400]   that can be squeezed together to grab small objects.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.040]   He called it the picker upper thing.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.760]   Around noon on a recent Thursday,
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.480]   Duginski's team had received 18 requests
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.840]   to fetch lost items, a third of them for AirPods.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.400]   - Pass them.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.000]   - Go ahead.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.680]   - Rats on the MTA, could they deserve fidelity?
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.000]   They deserve the wireless convenience
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.280]   as much as any community out of the commute
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.320]   or the reviews or the system.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.840]   I think that.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.120]   - By the way, if you lose an AirPod, I did not know this.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.840]   But thanks to Mac Rumor's article, I now know,
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:42.920]   Apple will replace a single AirPod for 69 bucks.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.560]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.400]   - So if you--
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.440]   - You get a single AirPod replacement.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:49.320]   - Yeah, if you're missing, if you don't have a match set,
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.280]   you can get them for 69 bucks.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.280]   How much titanium is actually in the titanium Apple card?
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.560]   Mark Gurman digging deep to get the answers.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.960]   He actually had an scanning electron microscope
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:10.840]   scan the card.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.600]   They sent it to a mini-herologist at UC Berkeley,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.040]   Hans Lüdahl Vink, who used what's known as
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.960]   a scanning electron microscope
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.640]   to determine the card's atomic makeup.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.280]   The answer?
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.720]   90%.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.560]   The rest of it's a little bit--
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.360]   - It might feel like a Joanna Stern video though.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.200]   - It's mostly titanium.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.960]   - It means Joanna Stern video.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.800]   - Yeah.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.160]   - Lori taking on Andy's metaphors,
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.880]   and now Mark is doing Joanna's videos.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.720]   It's just, it's a weird--
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.120]   - I think it's hysterical.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.160]   They sent it to Berkeley for analysis.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.440]   Thank you, Professor Vink.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.240]   - I'm just sorry that Ricky J passed away too early
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.080]   that we can't have him throwing Apple cards
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.200]   into watermelons.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   - Dan, you could too.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.040]   - I could tell you that Apple card, Dan--
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.280]   - What about Bullseye from Electra?
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.160]   Me, maybe I'm magic.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.840]   - Oh, he would see.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.320]   - He would be saying, you know, give me a challenge, man.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.200]   Give me a wadded up piece of clean X.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.920]   - I'm in Hell's Kitchen Exploded when Dan--
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.840]   Bullseye got his hands on Apple cards this week.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.680]   - Are you ready?
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.360]   - Full-sided versus dampened.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.680]   - Apple cards at 50 paces.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.680]   - Are you ready for USB 4?
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.320]   Here it comes, kids.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.400]   - Hard no.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.560]   - Hard no?
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:19.400]   It's based on--
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.600]   - No, I guess I'm ready.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.440]   - It's based on Thunderbolt,
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.440]   doubling the maximum bandwidth of USB,
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.760]   allowing for multiple simultaneous data
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.760]   and display protocols, 40 gigabit per second speed,
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:38.080]   backward compatible with USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3,
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.560]   dual lane operation.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.240]   I'm guessing it's still the client server setup
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.480]   of regular USB.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.640]   That's when different Thunderbolt is a direct memory access
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:51.000]   peer-to-peer connection.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.600]   - And PCI-E architecture.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.640]   - Yeah, I think.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.920]   But hey, 40 gigabits is 40 gigabits.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.760]   However--
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.480]   - As much as we love to rag on lightning,
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.920]   like can we just take a minute to under it?
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.840]   Like how does a normal consumer even begin
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.560]   to approach this because you have a letter
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.400]   which are the endpoints,
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.160]   but the endpoint also looks like Thunderbolt,
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.520]   which doesn't have to be there,
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.760]   and then the numbers indicate the capability.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.360]   - And maybe it has video.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.840]   Maybe you can charge.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.200]   Maybe it has video.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.240]   - So the USB 4 spec is complete,
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.680]   but it usually takes at least a year for new products
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.280]   to come out so later in 2020 for your--
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.400]   - We color code them?
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.640]   Can we write on the way?
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.600]   - It's gonna have a same exact opening.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.200]   It's gonna be the type C connector.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.120]   - Yeah.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:35.960]   - So.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.040]   - Is it gonna be super expensive?
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.400]   'Cause that's where I think a lot of people
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.200]   are gonna get confused as to whether or not,
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.880]   you know, is this just USB-C?
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.160]   Can I just use it to charge?
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.600]   And then they see this really expensive USB cable,
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.360]   and they think, well, isn't this just a charger?
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.040]   Why do I have to spend so much on it?
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.200]   - And as thick enough, is it shielded enough?
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:56.800]   Like, remember when HDR came out,
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.280]   everyone was super confused 'cause they were like,
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.440]   no, an HDMI cable, just an HDMI cable.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.640]   Why can't I get HDR?
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.600]   And then you're like, well, because it's not shielded,
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.840]   and because it's not HDMI 1.4,
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.480]   and because it's all over again.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.560]   - And I can't play copyrighted content
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.680]   because it's not a secure cable.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.600]   Without the pinouts, yup.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.800]   So it's-- - Yeah, gosh.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.080]   - I just wanna give a plug to Renee Ritchie,
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.880]   who will not stop playing Pokemon Go for nothing.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.320]   - Uh-oh, what did I do now?
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.560]   - He's got a new article, "How to Catch Unknown."
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.160]   In Pokemon Go, there's apparently 26,
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.800]   I'm sorry, 28 of them,
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.560]   and he's written an article on how to catch them.
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.080]   This is what Renee did for Labor Day.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.520]   - They're in K-A-X, right now, Leo.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.440]   - For Labor Day, he had a grilled cheese sandwich,
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.840]   an iced tea, and captured unknown all day long.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.800]   - Can't stop, won't stop. - It's the other thing.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.440]   - We have to get you back in the fold somehow.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.920]   - I've stopped playing Harry Potter,
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.680]   I'm bored, I don't care anymore about Harry Potter.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.840]   - I've got half of them now.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.920]   But in Pokemon With Unknowns,
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.120]   is the more you get, the harder it is to get when you don't have.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.600]   - Aye. (laughs)
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:06.120]   Well, isn't that the way it is in the world?
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.360]   201 on the road. - Yeah, but right now,
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.160]   you can get Ultra, 'cause the event are out,
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.120]   so Ultra is in 10K eggs.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:16.040]   - I have to tell, you see, Lisa's still playing,
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.280]   but I was the one who used to tell her about all this stuff,
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.800]   so she could do it. - Yeah.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.920]   - So now she's cast a drift in the Pokemon universe.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.680]   I've gotta get her connected with you, Renee,
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.420]   so she can know about unknown.
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.600]   - Well, we'll get it done, Leo.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.040]   (laughs)
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.200]   - Let's take a break, your picks next.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.600]   But first a word from my pick for the best
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.560]   Wi-Fi device out there, the Eero.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:44.880]   This is an Eero beacon, Eero blankets
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.040]   your whole home with fast, reliable Wi-Fi,
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:53.040]   eliminating poor coverage and dead spots and buffering.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:58.240]   Wi-Fi was not, when we first got Wi-Fi,
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.080]   we'd never contemplated this modern Wi-Fi world,
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.360]   where we have dozens of devices, IoT devices and ovens
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.680]   and everything connected to the Wi-Fi streaming video
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.400]   on four different screens, not to mention the fact
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.080]   that the neighbor's Wi-Fi is coming, boomin' in.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:18.620]   It's a really, it's a Wi-Fi hostel world.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:21.560]   So you need Eero.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.480]   I love our Eros.
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.800]   It sets up in just minutes, plugs right into your modem
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.280]   or modem router box.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.920]   You can manage it from the Eero app,
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.520]   you can place them with the Eero app,
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.120]   it helps you put them in the right spot
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.000]   and check that the signal's good.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.480]   You can also see what's going at any time.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.520]   Check usage, pause the Wi-Fi for dinner
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.080]   or in the case of our son for homework time.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.840]   Get alerts if any device attempts to join your network.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.680]   I really like that because when people come over
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.800]   or whatever, it say, "Oh, hey, here's a new device
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.880]   on your Eero."
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:00.040]   I have 32 connected devices on my Eero.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.880]   I can see what my internet bandwidth is.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.160]   And the thing is I not only use Eero at home,
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.600]   but when we got the new Eros,
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.200]   I gave the old Eros to my mom.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.400]   So I can switch over to my mom's network
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.120]   and see how her devices are working.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.720]   She's only got six connected devices.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.400]   But that's always a great thing.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.240]   They're all greens and they're lit up.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.680]   Let me show you another thing I love about Eero,
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.640]   which is Eero Plus.
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.360]   The VISTA added a new feature, Eero Secure Plus.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.000]   Look at this.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.200]   I get, not only do I get some great features
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.320]   like a free copy of malware bytes
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.560]   and a password vault and encrypt me,
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.520]   but I also can see the network threats
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.360]   that have been blocked.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.280]   There have been two threat blocks this week,
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:47.280]   307 ad blocks, 14,000 scans.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:51.000]   I love this, the safe filters for my family.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.360]   I could say, "Oh, Michael gets no adult,
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.640]   illegal or criminal content, no violent content."
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.760]   This is Eero Plus and I'm a huge fan.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.080]   Eero's getting better and better all the time.
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.680]   Your network will never again suffer from the
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.840]   "The Wi-Fi's down."
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:09.960]   I hate that.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.720]   Well, I get that yellow 10 p.m. every night,
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:12.560]   but that's from Michael.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.840]   I'm supposed to be down for him.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.520]   It expands to fit your needs.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.720]   It senses how you're using your Wi-Fi
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.520]   and it adjusts automatically so you can stream,
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   work and play from every corner of your house.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.240]   Why should you spend any effort thinking about Wi-Fi?
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.560]   Get yours fixed now.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.720]   In fact, you can get it tomorrow
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.640]   when you go to Eero.com/Macbreak.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.600]   If you use the offer code Macbreak at checkout,
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.760]   free overnight shipping.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.920]   Your Eero will be here tomorrow.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.280]   Your family will be thanking you at dinner.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.320]   E-E-R-O.com/Macbreak.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.440]   And then enter the offer code Macbreak at checkout
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.400]   to get your Eero delivered with free overnight shipping.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.120]   I love these Eero beacons because,
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:51.960]   what did I put it?
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.720]   Oh, here.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.840]   Because when, so you put the Eero base station
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.200]   by your cable modem or your DSL modem,
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.680]   but these beacons you can put around the house,
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.640]   all they do is they plug into the wall.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.240]   And they're, if you wish, a convenient nightlight too.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.040]   So I put them in the halls.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.440]   And that way the halls are got a nightlight.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.960]   And we've got Wi-Fi everywhere.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.160]   God, I love these Eero's.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.440]   And because I have outdoor cameras,
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.960]   I love having the Eero.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.080]   I could place it close to the wall
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.320]   so that the doorbell, the ring doorbell,
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.840]   and the nest cams and everything that's outside,
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.560]   they get good strong Wi-Fi, which is really great.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.040]   E-E-R-O.com/Macbreak.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.120]   And don't forget the offer code Macbreak for,
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.640]   not only do you get free overnight shipping,

[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.880]   You've helped the show by letting the Eero folks know
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.100]   you heard it here first.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.680]   Eero.com/Macbreak.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.560]   Thank you, Eero, for your support.
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.440]   Thank you for using that special URL
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.120]   in the offer code Macbreak at checkout.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.400]   Andy and Ico, pick something.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.240]   I bought that flash you recommended,
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.160]   pick something else like that.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160]   That was good.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.080]   That was good stuff.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.840]   Yeah, we have too much money Andy, please.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.200]   Help us spend it.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:03.360]   Yeah, well, unfortunately, I picked a free thing this week.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.920]   Oh, well, or you can just put so many in a box.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.080]   Andy, I'm gonna be spending so much money next week.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.520]   I'm just thrilled.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.360]   Thank you.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.800]   I've got thousands of dollars in iPhones
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.280]   and watches to buy next week.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.560]   Cut it all on your Apple.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.880]   I will.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.880]   You put it all on your Apple.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:20.720]   I will.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.800]   Well, my pick is, believe it or not,
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.200]   the Wikipedia app for iOS.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.920]   Because now I'm used to,
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.840]   every time I need to search for something on Wikipedia,
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.400]   just opening up a browser tab.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.720]   And I don't know how I happened accidentally
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.120]   wind up downloading the app to get it instead.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.280]   But oh my God, it is one of the most wonderful apps.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.160]   It's now an app that I use every single day.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.520]   Because yes, it's there for you.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.880]   If you just want to search for something,
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.560]   what's the, how much, how much Tungsten did this country?
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.440]   Mine and ship in 1968.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.600]   Okay, finally, I'll give you that.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.120]   But it's the most beautiful information book
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.320]   you can ever get.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.640]   When you start it up, it just will give you,
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.080]   here's a featured article for today.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.720]   Here are some articles related to what day in history this is.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.120]   On this day, here are, here's a random articles,
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.360]   articles related to topics that are in the news.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.920]   So we've got a hurricane coming.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.800]   So here's not only information about Hurricane Dorian,
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.920]   but in articles that are related to the areas
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.120]   that are going to be hit and to the concept of hurricanes.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.240]   And not only that, but the ability to simply explore,
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.840]   like to remember, if you're old enough to have
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.440]   the People's Almanac or the Book of Lists,
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.000]   it's just this thick book full of really interesting articles
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.800]   that you would find yourself just sitting, in my case,
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.760]   you know, just sitting in my parents living room
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.760]   like Frostlegged at age 10, 11,
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.960]   just reading, reading, reading,
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.840]   'cause I just kept finding interesting things to read.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.560]   And this is what the app enables and what it does.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.760]   You can also very quickly just simply just
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   preload up your phone with articles
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.520]   if you wanna read, interesting stuff you wanna read later.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.680]   This morning, I loaded up an article
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.640]   on the biggest man-made explosions that have ever happened,
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.680]   that have nothing to do,
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.800]   non-nuclear man-made explosions.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.240]   And it's a really long, well-researched article
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.200]   and it simply tapped the Save button.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.520]   And it was simply again, downloaded with all the media,
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.280]   all the formatting onto the device.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.840]   And now, just like I will often,
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.920]   if I have time on a bus or on a train,
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:26.160]   open up the Pocket app or open up the Kindle app,
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.520]   I will open up the Wikipedia app
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.600]   to read all these really interesting,
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.560]   informative articles that I've just sort of collated
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.520]   as interesting things I'm gonna be checking out.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.520]   But once again, it really is, now every morning,
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:40.400]   it is on that list of apps that I check out,
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.080]   just to get my brain back online
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.400]   after eight hours of downtime.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.080]   And sometimes I'll find, I have to tell myself,
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.280]   "Okay, let's bookmark this, let's save this for later
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.400]   "because we really have to pee.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.160]   "And also, we have a train that's gonna be leaving
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.800]   "in 25 minutes and we haven't showered or shaved yet
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.200]   "because it's just such a good app."
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.440]   And it really is just one of the most wonderfully designed
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:07.800]   apps ever and a perfect compliment to the mission
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.200]   of Wikimedia Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.560]   - Nice and free.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:14.240]   I remember 25 years ago, spending hundreds of dollars
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.160]   for the World Book, which took up a whole shelf
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.880]   for my kids when they were little.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.800]   - And you had to get annuals every year.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.240]   - And it was always at a date.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.600]   - Yeah, a good friend of mine was the film editor
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.840]   at Microsoft Incarta CD-ROM.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.640]   And some just building CD.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.400]   - It's too bad because Britannica and World Book
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.280]   are actually out of business now.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:38.320]   But in your phone, you have the world's knowledge
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.920]   updated all the time.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.960]   - And we're asked to course Wikipedia,
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:44.040]   the word was a punchline to a joke
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.600]   for the first few years when it got started.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.360]   Oh great, I know it's a fact 'cause I put it on Wikipedia.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.600]   Now it is so well, any article that is of any importance
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.680]   or popularity, there are editors and experts
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.960]   that are really on top of it.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.600]   You can't change it without being changed back really quickly
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.520]   with an edit trail to tell you exactly what happened.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.520]   So it's still a crowdsourced piece of resource
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.400]   just like any other, so don't trust it 100%.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.680]   But now, my assumption is that if I read it on Wikipedia,
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.040]   I'm still gonna double check it, but I believe,
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.240]   I'm inclined to believe that it's going to be true
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.680]   when I find out when I check out the actual sources.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.520]   - I completely agree with you.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.560]   - It's not only my page, it's so old and outdated.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.400]   - It's wrong.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.680]   - It's, well, somebody fix Renee's page, Renee can't,
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.680]   but somebody else can't.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.520]   - Exactly.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.360]   - Yes, thank you.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.440]   - And I just think we forget what a great boon
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.480]   that that has been, it is such a great resource.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.520]   I use it every day.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.160]   - And again, it's not just for trivia, for state capitals,
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.680]   it is, there's just interesting articles about,
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.320]   again, and then you find yourself, oh, well,
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.440]   what was like the biggest accidental explosion
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:50.360]   and then you find out reading about Halifax, where,
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.760]   and not only that, but here is exactly how
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.720]   the Halifax explosion happened, where you have two ships,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.480]   one of which not yielding the right away,
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.600]   but the other ship is loaded with munition supplies,
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.480]   due for World War I, and you'd think that you would let
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.840]   that ship have the right away, but I guess not.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.000]   - I make a monthly donation to the Wikimedia Foundation.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.640]   It's one of the charities I support because I should do that.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.320]   - It is the best thing ever, and I'm very grateful.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.440]   - I read it rather than use every night now.
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.280]   - Yeah.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.120]   - Oh, that's smart.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.160]   - Yeah, the new, actually the new sections are very good
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.000]   on Wikimedia media.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   - Yeah.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]   - Lori Gill, I have a problem.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.320]   - I would say--
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.800]   - I am storing my apple card in a leather wall,
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.200]   and I'm worried it's gonna get stained.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.360]   Surely there's gotta be a better way.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.160]   - There has got to be a better way.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.640]   So, curve, K-E-R-F, I think I've mentioned before,
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.720]   they make these absolutely gorgeous iPhone cases
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.520]   made out of reclaimed wood.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:46.000]   They're phenomenal, they feel good, they look good.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.920]   Now they have an apple card holder.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.560]   - Oh, guaranteed not to stain.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.240]   - Yeah, guaranteed not to stain.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.840]   So, some people are gonna find this to be kind of silly,
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.120]   why would you need something like this for your apple card?
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.960]   I would argue that there are also going to be,
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.960]   and currently are a lot of people
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.400]   who aren't gonna carry apple card in their wallet,
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.440]   they just got it because they want to have it.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.800]   I've talked to people on Twitter that are this way.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.320]   Here's a display box for you.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:15.360]   Here's a nice protective box for you to put it in.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.120]   Yes, it's thick, you're not gonna fit this in your wallet.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.520]   It's gonna be uncomfortable in your back pocket,
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.560]   but it's fancy. - It's so work of art.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.680]   - It's made out of really nice wood,
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.400]   and you know, it just makes you that much more pretentious
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.320]   with your apple card than you ever were before.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.240]   - It's the pretentious box apple left out.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.720]   - All that people.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.000]   - I completely think this is the case
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.040]   that apple would sell for the apple card in their store.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.960]   It's gorgeous, so.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.600]   - If they wouldn't be mocked mercilessly,
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.200]   you're probably right. - Exactly, yeah.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.600]   - Which, did you pick one, which wood did you get?
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.600]   - A walnut.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.600]   - Walnuts, beautiful.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.440]   - Yeah, that's my--
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.000]   - I like the darker. - I like that one, yeah.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:57.920]   - I like the darker.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.440]   A lot of people like spalted maple,
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.080]   but I'm a walnut kind of guy, yeah.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.360]   I'm a waltzian. - I prefer that.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.960]   - You can't get it from too, yeah.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.440]   - Yeah, an ultra suede on the inside, which is a leather,
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.520]   but okay, maybe it's a plastic leather.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.560]   That is, right, ultra suede.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:12.560]   Is that a leather leather?
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.120]   - It's a, it's a-- - Oh, it's all,
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.800]   it's all cantara, it's a faux leather.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.680]   - Okay, so that's guaranteed not to bleed.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.880]   Renee Ritchie, pick of the week, sir.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.000]   - So firstly, I'm gonna have this desperate attempt
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.840]   to lure you back by showing you shiny,
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.360]   looking at the laser. - Oh, right,
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.640]   Kaza's beautiful.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:36.800]   - There you go. - You can go get them.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.520]   So my pick of the week, and forgive me
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.600]   if we've mentioned this before,
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:45.120]   but Nintendo announced a switch light recently.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.640]   They did introduce a new version,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.920]   slightly better battery, slightly better CPU
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.960]   for the existing Nintendo switch,
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.520]   but they also introduced a switch light,
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.640]   which is a different take on it.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.640]   And I didn't think I'd like it because
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:56.960]   I have the original switch,
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.480]   and what I like about it is with my God kids,
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.600]   we plug it into the TV, and then they show me
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.240]   that I am way too old to play games
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.520]   like Super Smash Brothers.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:05.360]   Where'd my character go?
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.840]   Why am I falling again?
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:10.240]   But they loved it, and they loved playing on the TV,
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.880]   but then I saw a lot of the coverage
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.520]   that this was getting in a lot of the reviews,
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:15.360]   and it really looks like just a great,
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.880]   less expensive way to take all of the really, really fun
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.720]   Nintendo games.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.200]   I mean, they're gonna have Pokemon Sword and Shield
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.400]   coming out this fall,
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.440]   which I'm sure is gonna shatter game records all over again.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:29.440]   And the controllers don't come out.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.960]   It doesn't really switch,
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:33.760]   so it's kind of honorifically a switch device.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.160]   It's a switch without the switch part,
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.840]   but if you just want something that's smaller and portable
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.840]   and has the Joy-Cons attached so you can't lose them,
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.280]   you don't have to connect them.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.240]   It's just super simple.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.600]   Then this looks like a really, really good device,
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.960]   and because my God kids have totally stolen,
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.360]   they take after their mother, George, it out,
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.200]   just totally stolen my technology
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.880]   and left me bereft of Nintendo's switchiness.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.400]   I was thinking about getting this instead,
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.360]   'cause I don't need to attach it to anything.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.080]   I'll just play with the device by itself
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.760]   and see myself 100 bucks while I'm doing it.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.720]   - Very nice.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.040]   So I don't know if you guys know,
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.840]   but September 3rd is a national holiday in Japan.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.360]   It's the day the new Hobonichi Techos come out.
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:18.600]   And they're here and it's probably already too late
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   to order them because they sell out fast.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.400]   This is my favorite day planner.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.520]   I know you're thinking, Leo, paper day planner?
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.920]   What are you, crazy in this digital age?
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.360]   But these are such works of art.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:30.800]   They're so beautiful.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.840]   And they have such fun colors.
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:39.520]   I feel bad because I wanted to get this bear cover
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.680]   for Micah, he said he liked it
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.880]   and it's out of stock already.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.640]   Won't be back in stock for another month.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.200]   Sorry Micah, but there are plenty of them still in stock.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:50.800]   Remember, it's a Japanese company.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.920]   So you wanna get the English version
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.320]   of the Hobonichi Techo Art and Science
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.200]   makes some very nice ones.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.800]   This is the one I ordered.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.360]   Just went on sale 11 a.m. Japan time this morning.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.560]   I have a Hobonichi from last year.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.080]   I don't really need a new cover.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.080]   So the cover is a separate thing.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:15.240]   The Hobonichi itself is made out of beautiful paper.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.040]   It's called Tomogawa paper,
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.600]   which is one of, it's very light, very thin paper,
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.800]   but it's impermeable enough for a fountain pen,
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.640]   which is what I use.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   In fact, that's one of the reasons I love
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.080]   the Hobonichi covers is because you could thread
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.520]   a fountain pen through the loops and it keeps it closed.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.720]   It's got lots of pouches and places to store stuff.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.880]   Two bookmark tabs so you can have one for the month
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.640]   and one for the day.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.120]   If you get the Japanese version,
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.480]   you'll have very pithy Japanese quotes at the bottom,
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.000]   but I like to read the English.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.600]   So I got the English version with the English quotes.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:57.880]   It is just beautifully, beautifully done day planner.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:00.280]   So I don't know if you use a paper planner or not,
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.960]   but these sell out very fast.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.440]   There are American stores.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.480]   Sometimes you can get them on Amazon,
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.640]   but if you really want the full choice of 2020 Ticos,
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.080]   they've just come out as of today
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.560]   and there are a lot of fun covers and great looks.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.400]   - Wow.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.240]   - Yeah.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.400]   - This is gonna cost me some money.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.040]   - This is the one you want Andy.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.920]   - You got me back for that flight because
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.680]   I haven't tried to find like a writing book,
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.440]   writing notebook that was small enough
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.000]   that I could put it in like any bag.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.360]   - That's why I like it.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.040]   - And lovely enough that I won't just like
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.400]   leave it someplace and.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.960]   - I think you should get this Steve cover
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.320]   'cause it's a little teddy bear cover.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.560]   I think it'd be very nice.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.400]   - Aww.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:41.720]   - I think that would be very lovely.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.320]   - That would be the school where the
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.920]   hit your guy to the galaxy having
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.520]   don't panic on the cover.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:49.480]   - When I do like the size, they make a variety of them.
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.040]   This is the original kind of day planner
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.320]   with all the days of the year each day.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:57.600]   It has a separate page plus a full month calendar
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.680]   every month and a year calendar as well.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.040]   But they make them without lining.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.400]   They make a five year version.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.600]   They make a variety of different ones.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.080]   So do look at all the different covers
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.760]   and the different kinds of books.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.920]   There's the planner, the original,
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:13.120]   which is what I have in English.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.400]   There's the planner, there's the VEC
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.160]   and then there's day free, which is just unmarked.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.920]   That won't be out for a while.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.120]   - You're a procrastinator.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:23.680]   Stay away from the five year version.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.520]   - Yeah.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.920]   You know, I often forget to write in it.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.880]   But I think these are wonderful.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.920]   Of course, you're gonna have to sit and look at it
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:34.400]   for a few months because it doesn't start till January.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.320]   They have--
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.520]   - You can organize in advance, Leo.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.360]   - Yeah.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.880]   Well, the other thing I really like that makes it fun
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.040]   is they have in the back, they have informational,
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.160]   as all good planners do international country codes,
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.440]   dialing clothes, national holidays for every country.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.920]   But then this is my favorite,
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.720]   a world of traditional sweets,
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.660]   sweets from all around the world.
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.000]   - Why didn't Google use that?
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:58.840]   - Yes.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.480]   And then the Japanese zodiac,
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:04.320]   traditional Japanese household items
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.120]   and international sized charts
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.160]   and conversion charts contacts.
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.000]   But I just, the paper is,
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.400]   you're gonna love the paper, Andy.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.760]   It's very thin and light, but it's beautiful.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:15.600]   It's Tomodowo papers.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.080]   - Or it's right in every Apple invite day
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:18.440]   for next year's conference already.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.680]   - And I bought the non-included,
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.360]   but nice to have little card
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.640]   that you could put behind the page
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.240]   for a little harder writing surface.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.240]   So, yeah.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.240]   - Play, look at all the accessories, you'll love it.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:33.400]   - Can I also say another vote in its favor that
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   I used to buy sketch,
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.560]   before even the Newton message pad,
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.160]   before PDAs, before phones.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.600]   Like I used to buy like a pocket sketchbook
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.320]   that would have notes from everything
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.600]   and where my appointments are
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.600]   and everything I'd need to take a note someplace
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.600]   would be in there.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.280]   And that was for like three or four years.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:54.080]   And there is nothing more pleasant
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.000]   than like 10, 15 years later, 20 years later,
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.480]   going through this book that has all these stickers on it
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.680]   and was beat to hell 'cause it was carried everywhere
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.200]   and has all these kinds of notes
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.000]   from 18 different pens.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.520]   It's like looking through Henry Jones' grail diary.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:11.080]   - That's the reason I started doing it exactly, Andy.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.760]   'Cause I have all these digital records.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.160]   I don't really need an analog record,
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:18.000]   but there's something fun about seeing this coffee stain
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.280]   and the blood stain and the tear stains
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.120]   from years gone past.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.160]   So just thought I'd pass this along.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.000]   It's not for everybody.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.400]   They're a little pricey there, but they're worth it.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:30.040]   - Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.360]   Actually, I think there's--
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.840]   - Do you wanna make your iPhone?
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.000]   - Is that a real iPhone?
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.680]   - I think there's a Japanese stationery store
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.920]   in your Bryant Park that sells them.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.240]   - They might have, yeah.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.800]   I think now that I've seen them again
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.840]   that I almost bought one like last year,
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.520]   but I'm gonna be in New York in a couple of weeks
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.560]   and yeah, I think I'm gonna have to leave somebody
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.400]   behind at this.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.320]   - That's where the future office is.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.800]   We're doomed, we're doomed, Laurie.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.760]   (laughing)
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:53.440]   - I do like the fuzzy teddy bear one.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.040]   I should get one for you, Andy.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:56.840]   Maybe get you the teddy bear cover.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:57.680]   (laughing)
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:00.040]   It just seems like it's Andy, doesn't it?
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.680]   - You need to, if you're gonna be like consulting something
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.160]   for information, sometimes startling information,
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160]   you're gonna have to.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.600]   You're gonna wanna see it's okay.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.480]   Look, fuzzy teddy bear.
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.760]   - Good plan on your-- - Not judging you.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:14.280]   - Not judging you. - Not for 2020 right now.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.800]   - I just love it.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.480]   - Hey, thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.680]   Always a pleasure to talk about Apple.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:24.040]   Next week, of course, we're gonna have a lot to talk about.
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.440]   We don't know what, maybe new iPhones.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.320]   I don't know.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.720]   Join us at the usual time right after the Apple event.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:33.680]   - Our coverage begins at 10 a.m. Pacific,
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.560]   1 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:38.280]   You can watch live at live.tv/live.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.600]   No, yeah, well live.tv or twitter.tv/live.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.160]   Actually, that's the better one, twitter.tv/live.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.600]   Renee Ritchie, he is gonna be in the Bay Area, I think.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.400]   Next week, I have a feeling,
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.800]   but you can catch his coverage at imore.com.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:54.840]   And of course, the Vector podcast is a daily effort
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.800]   that's always world worth watching.
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.480]   imore.com/vector.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.160]   Thank you, Renee, for being here.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.160]   Safe travels.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160]   We'll talk, I guess, in two weeks.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.800]   - It's in two weeks. - Yeah.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.680]   Andy Inaco, catch him this week and every week
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:09.200]   on WGBH in Boston.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:11.000]   What day today, this week?
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.720]   - Friday again, 1 p.m.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.160]   and we are gonna be doing it from the WGBH radio studios
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:17.360]   at the Boston Public Library.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.600]   So open to the public, by all means,
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.640]   they usually have really cool guests.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.640]   That's last time the guest before me was Ellen Rooney,
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.640]   was a legendary and beloved journalist in the Boston area.
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:35.840]   Michael Dukakis, former governor of Presidential Candidate,
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.840]   a current Democratic Presidential candidate,
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:40.880]   and coming up next, Andy Inaco, like, okay, I'm fine.
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:41.880]   - Oh boy.
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:44.480]   - And I am not running for anything, Andy says.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:45.320]   - Exactly.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:48.320]   - But he looks good in the tank, that's the difference.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.560]   And Laurie Gill, you'll find her at imore
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.360]   as well managing editor, imore.com,
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:56.040]   we're out on the street in front of Apple Park on Tuesday,
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.280]   begging for-- - Tid bits with her
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:52:59.120]   chili oil.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:00.440]   (laughing)
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.720]   And her tie-dye d'hyrndle.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.160]   Great to have you, Laurie.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.640]   Appleholic on the Twitter.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:08.160]   We thank you all for joining us every Tuesday, 11 a.m.

[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.040]   It's an old fashioned way of modern communication,
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:27.240]   irc.twit.tv.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.880]   If you can't be here in person or in live land,
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:33.040]   you should always download every episode

[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:37.480]   You could find them at the website twit.tv/mbw.
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.120]   But the easiest thing to do is subscribe
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.800]   in your favorite podcast application
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.280]   or on YouTube, and that way you'll get it
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.520]   automatically at the minute, it's available.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:46.680]   Thanks for being here, everybody.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:49.520]   Now time to get back to work because
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.880]   break time is over.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:51.880]   See you next time.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:57.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:02.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:04.620]   (upbeat music)
