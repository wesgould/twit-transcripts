[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.140]   latest Apple news and this is the last show before WWDC and all the big
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.600]   announcements Renee Richie's here from imore.com. He's pouring cold water on my
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.000]   parade. I'll tell you why in just a second also Andy and I go from the Chicago
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.440]   Sun Times not Trunk. Not Trunk. Is that the other guys? Is that gonna be the
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.840]   new hashtag for the Sun Times? Not Trunk. Exactly. We'll just put an exclamation
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.560]   point in front of it. We'll steal all their all the yard signs and all their
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.080]   busts and things. We'll have people put big exclamation mark stickers.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.800]   Sometimes Andy will be fine.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.560]   WWDC is Monday and the reason I say you're raining on my parade Renee is because
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.320]   you published an article on imore saying don't expect any hardware
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.240]   announcements. I said think software I think was a weasel words that I chose.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.480]   For just in case. Pouring rain. Well I mean the thing is like it's really
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.880]   late in the cycle so I would think that if hardware was gonna was ready on time
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.360]   we would know about it. So that's the rationales we just haven't heard any leaks
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.480]   in other words. I kind of asked about some of the stuff and they were like yeah we
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.840]   wish. So you know some of the stuff is really interesting rumors but it just
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.480]   doesn't sound like it's ready for easy. There's not in the pipeline
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.640]   immediately or it's just not ready for the wdc. How about the Mac? It's not
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.480]   atypical though. I mean there've been many years where it's been an almost
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   completely software focused show. So while we have gotten things like iPhones
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.760]   in the past or new Mac Pros or new MacBooks those are sort of bonuses and
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.560]   there've been plenty of years where Apple specifically you know sort of let
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.480]   people know it's software only. Yeah. Remember the role of this event. When we
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.200]   see hardware announcements it's usually because well they have the venue
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.560]   already booked. They have the attention of the press. This is not
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.600]   something that necessarily they would book 5,000 people to come in to go see
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.320]   but so long as we've got we need a place to show off the new Mac book. We
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.520]   need a new place to show off the new Mac Pro so we're gonna do it here. But if
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.000]   you don't have anything to say there's no there's no real reason. Yeah. In other
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.840]   words WDC will be what it is supposed to be and nothing else. Nothing more.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.880]   Yeah. And there's a lot of really frustrated with a lack of new Mac Pros
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.960]   because for them it's as simple as shoving a Skylake chip and throwing it
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.520]   out the door. Oh no. But not going for something more ambitious with this MacBook
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.720]   Pro and that means that it's not necessarily Skylake constrained but it
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.680]   could be OLED or touch ID or any of several other new features that are
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.520]   rolling into it constrained. So I think that can be that can be super
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.960]   frustrating for Mac Pro customers because for them time literally is money.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.520]   That's getting getting an hour job down to 52 minutes will actually save
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.040]   them make them a lot more money. So they don't they're not they're not they're
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.000]   not breaking down Cupertino's door saying please please if you have to take
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.520]   another year we want that OLED strip around the side of it said no whatever
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   you just put take to go to the go to Best Buy. I'll even I'll even point to the
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.680]   row where they have these Intel chips. I want you to buy that put it in there
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.440]   and give it to me because I want that you know you're you're sometimes people
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.360]   think that Apple's focusing on the wrong things but in in the end they get to do
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.920]   what they want to do.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.200]   Well, wait isn't there a little bit of a risk though of a back I guess it's
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   probably good and probably one of the reasons you're hearing leaks that there
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.520]   isn't going to be anything is it's probably good to calm people down a little
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   bit because it would be a backlash if we all go there on Monday and and it's
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.160]   just you know okay new iOS we knew that new it's better to ruin W Musk right
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.360]   now than to run out. Yeah, yeah. There is a there is a lot of back channel stuff
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.520]   that happens in the weeks leading up. Sometimes there's there's no way to to
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.760]   prove this one way or another. I do believe that Apple tries to prime the
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.960]   pump one way or another before the event just to make sure that if people are
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.200]   expecting amazing Titanic news after Google I owe a lot of people were saying
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.720]   well you know I've heard that Google that Apple's going to be announcing their
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.920]   own like their their own AI system that's four times as good as Google's and
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.120]   it's going there their own home system that's even eight times better than this
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.440]   and if then if they don't do that then people who are not good writers have
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.800]   Wow Apple failed to ship the ever the device that everybody thought that they
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.520]   were going to do so it's not as though it's not as though there tends to be an
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.200]   attempt to control but if we're all talking to everybody at the same time
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   and if there's an opportunity to quietly say you were thinking about
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.720]   sitting this one out you may want to actually pay the thousand or fifteen
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.800]   hundred bucks to come out to see this one or to indicate that things are
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.920]   happening but they're just going to be typical WWDC stuff without actually
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.360]   coming up and saying it I do think that Apple sometimes tries to manage that I've
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.200]   got I've had conversations in the past that were kind of in that kind of tone
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.480]   where I thought this is that's an interesting conversation that I just had
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   kind of out of the blue but okay and I mean tell you what I'm not having a
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.840]   new Mac Pro you keep saying Mac Pro and I know you mean back book Pro but but the
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.360]   Mac Pro is also neglected isn't there risk people are going to start saying
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.520]   Apple isn't like somebody in our chat room Apple doesn't care about OS 10 and
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   Macintosh anymore they've been saying that for years though I mean with the new
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.440]   MacBook with a new Mac Pro redesign with the final car Pro redesign with a lot of
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.040]   the things they've been doing with the positioning of OS 10 server they've been
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.560]   a long-hitting theme that Apple doesn't care about pros that they care more about
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.720]   empowering mainstream users and they do about power users I think the balance of
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   WWDC though is expectation all debt because if we if everyone shows up
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.680]   expecting new MacBook Pros new Mac pros new 5k displays and literally
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.400]   everybody is expecting that and then none of it happens regardless of what they
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.440]   show for iOS 10 or OS 10 10.12 or watch OS or TVOS the whole story afterwards
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.240]   will be oh no new Mac Pros no new MacBook Pros no new Apple displays so the
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.920]   expectation of debt is tremendous and managing that is tough and I tried
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.520]   before every show to sort of help set expectations because the last thing I
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.960]   want is to be there covering a keynote and every second comment is oh no this
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.920]   Apple's doomed oh no that this is terrible and a lot of it even beyond you
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.880]   know what Apple may or may not do with with the BizPubs there's just a lot
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.480]   that's logical that you can sort of look at and and see you know what is a
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.600]   technology what would it require to achieve this rumor and doesn't seem like
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.000]   something they could do this year or is that something like oh let's just have an
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.920]   OLED display well touch ID sorry 3D touch works based on LED so in order to
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.280]   have an OLED display they'd have to re-engineer the way that works is that a
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.920]   short-term project long-term project you know how does that sort of logically fit
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.360]   in then I think we sort of help people set their expectations and maybe get a
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.720]   little bit of disappointment out of the way early on yeah yeah but I do think
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.120]   that that is that can be a point of concern there are people like us who are
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.480]   real died in the wool Apple people that I can't I can hardly imagine a scenario
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.920]   that would get me to if I've got $2,000 to spend on an notebook to not spend it
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.880]   on a new MacBook but there are people that look my MacBook is to my my
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   MacBook is from 2012 I keep waiting for this it's it's starting to die right
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.320]   now I need a new one but it hasn't really received a significant update in
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.600]   the last year and I'm hoping that if if WWC comes out and they show up something
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.280]   really really awesome then that's great I will earmark 2000 bucks for the new
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.680]   MacBook when it gets released in August but if they keep saying if they keep
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.120]   delaying excuse me not delaying it but if they if another year goes by without a
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   MacBook it causes it might cause some of these people to look around and say
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.400]   well what else is out there because I can't deal with having a notebook that
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.120]   has no no L key functioning and I don't want to spend a thousand bucks to to have
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.760]   that keyboard replaced it might cause them to look around and suddenly see that
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.640]   again someone who is not necessarily a Mac fan to see that well actually Windows
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   10 is actually pretty good or hey look these Chromebooks are now a lot better
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.440]   than I thought they were and maybe I don't actually need this anymore or or an
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.040]   iPad Pro I think will actually do me just fine instead of spending 2000 bucks
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.240]   on a MacBook on a MacBook and you'll spend just a thousand bucks plus 200
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.080]   bucks worth of accessories so I wonder how if it's I wonder if it's possible
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.160]   that Apple loses a lot of opportunities by not having metronome like updates to
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.000]   their hardware the expectation that if there is a you will we will not be
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.400]   selling MacBooks or Mac minis that had last year last year's generation
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.360]   processor in it because we're going to make sure that if you buy you're going
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.200]   to get fresh produce no matter what time of year you you come into the market
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   I think that's true I think also that they there are sometimes expectations and
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.160]   they make all these decisions they have these same conversations on they'll say do
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.000]   we want to try the more conservative or the more aggressive prototype can we
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.200]   get it to market and they might feel that they can and then something happens and
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.240]   it's delayed internally like it doesn't meet whatever internal
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.440]   checkpoint they have for it and therefore it's to reevaluate those plans or they
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.120]   could say it's just not going to be ready on time put the Skylake chip in the
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.480]   existing model and we'll just ship it and then we'll try again for next year next
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.600]   time wouldn't want them to do that of course but I would hope that they're
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.120]   spending some energy on new hardware do you think we'll see it maybe I mean so the
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.520]   prime time to do it is before back to school right yeah so although I think for
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.080]   this we're looking at you know like they said in the room or Q4 which is they've
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.400]   already missed it they missed it if they they would want to announce by April or
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.840]   May so that people can get their so that institutions can get the purchase
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.200]   orders and and also they want to make sure the things are kind of on the shelf
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.320]   for people who are actually going back to school in September and October
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.200]   and that's probably a MacBook Air mix anyway for them back to school
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.000]   I mean the Mac Pro is long in the two I don't know I think there are people
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.680]   we're going to just get tired of waiting I really I did that bottle Linux machine
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.840]   yeah it was full and this has a you know this has a Skylake in it
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:38.560]   the small company can do it this has a NVIDIA GeForce 980M in it a small company could do it
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.240]   the other see the other problem is that a lot of it used to be that if you wanted to do high-end
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.160]   Photoshop if you want to do high-end photo editing high-end video high-end pre-pest
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.560]   pre-press you really were stuck with the Mac but now pretty much every standard app
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.280]   and every standard platform is multi-platform so there could you don't want to
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.240]   give a consumer the ability to sort of break out of that habit to suddenly start to look around and
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.520]   think well what if for the first time in 12 years I bought a Windows machine instead of a Mac to
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.680]   run this on and then they realize that well actually that's actually part of my existing
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.880]   Adobe license that I can get Windows versus these apps right I've talked to I've got I've got a
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   friend who a couple of friends who already trans moved their shops over to Windows hardware and
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.920]   they said it was it took them about two days to get everything done and everything was perfectly
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.640]   why am I waiting an extra year for hardware that may or may not ship and this going to cost me an
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.720]   extra eight or eight hundred or nine hundred dollars so it's you always want to make sure that
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.440]   it's the oldest maximum of marketing when someone has money in their hand and they're
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.080]   thrusting it at you you take money out of that hand and put one of your products back into that
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.200]   hand and say goodbye to them you don't simply say nope we don't want your money right now come
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.120]   back in a year because that money may be already be spent somewhere else yeah I do think that
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.800]   Apple in an ideal world Apple would have had you know all that stuff ready for WWDC but I also
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.920]   think they've been saying this before that for them power like the ability to process more isn't
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.360]   the constraining factor anymore that people pretty much think their computers are big and are good
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.960]   enough and dandy's point before absolutely there are people at the bleeding edge that need the
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.200]   more power the fastest possible but for a lot of people that shift to power efficiency and maybe
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.760]   looking at that they've decided that skylake is a commodity now everyone's going to be shipping
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.360]   chips with skylake in order for them to have a reason and and they're very clear with us like
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.440]   the MacBook has to have a reason to exist it has to be more than just a more powerful processor at
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.200]   this point and it has to be a feature and maybe that feature is like the OLED screen maybe that
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.600]   feature is the touch ID sensor I think that feature is something else but in order for them to make
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.920]   what they believe is a worthwhile next generation computer it's not just a chipset anymore and you
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.280]   know they thought that maybe that would be ready earlier and it's not but it's still higher up on
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.920]   their list than than just making a faster well I have to do have to acknowledge that I just want
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.320]   to say that mostly I was talking about not the Macbook Pro but the Mac Pro Mac Pro those really
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.000]   super and that's a really good point on Macbooks also remember that when I when I toasted my
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.320]   my two-year-old Macbook in a hotel room in November I just simply went
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.680]   walked across the parking lot and to an Apple store bought a new Macbook and brought it back in
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.760]   that I didn't necessarily care about what was in it or what it did because I need to have a
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.880]   working Macbook so it's possible we're it's it's we're part of the fun of what we do for a living
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:23.760]   is that we get to talk about this in a way more detailed way that maybe consumers actually react
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.680]   but if there's something that I that I if there's a behavior that I wish that Apple would change it's
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:36.960]   that fixating on doing a revolution when really all we want is good all some people want is good
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:43.120]   value or just an incremental change it's a lot more complicated than just putting a new CPU in but
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.240]   I would hate to think that I'm I would be waiting six months because Apple wants to put an OLED
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.200]   touchpad in there and I really don't care about an OLED touchpad or they want they want to make
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.560]   sure they're trying to get this new keyboard to work and I don't really I like the old keyboard
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.440]   you're basically making me wait eight months for something that I don't value it's possible though
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.240]   I mean first of all the the couple of year old Mac Pro or the couple of year old Macbook Pro is not
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.800]   out of date that's very clear right processors have been fast enough for a long time you get a
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.360]   refresh every year from Apple so you're probably right that real people would just see this as
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.840]   hey that's normal that's economical but it's not how Apple's done this Apple has never
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:30.640]   eschewed an opportunity to sell new hardware whether you need it or not let's face it and so I'm wondering
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.880]   if it and this is the only reason I bring it up if it shows I mean we're look this what we do we
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   read tea leaves because we have so little information we have to read tea leaves but does it show a
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:47.040]   lack of interest in the market now they're looking at the PC marketplace which is dying they're doing
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.560]   better than the PC marketplace but maybe they think look we make so much money and mobile what we
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.120]   don't really have to worry so much about desktop I don't think it's quite like that I think that
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.320]   they're they appreciate the fact that they're unique that if they don't that if people don't like the
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.600]   hardware that they're making or they don't like the schedule that they're producing it at or they
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.320]   don't like the price that they're growing at your alternative is to go switch to an entirely
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.760]   different platform and buy entirely new apps and I don't it would take a lot for someone to be so
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.920]   frustrated with any of those kind of intangible things to go through all that expense and all
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:26.000]   that trouble so I think they realize that there's a they have a larger cushion for pushing out these
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.040]   updates then then they would if they were a Windows hardware developer if they were a Windows
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.360]   hardware hardware maker they would really they'd be competing against eight different companies
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   again there's so many people lined up to get that two thousand dollars out of their customers hands
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.320]   that they would have no choice but to do things on other people's schedule but
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.440]   and save people still out sells that industry I mean yeah but and but any individual company
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.200]   anyway I think all I think all that means is that they are outselling I don't think I don't know
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.360]   if that if that has any other significance yeah and also also keeping keep in mind that like
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.440]   Chromebooks are now outselling all Macs which is right okay because of the fact that cost at least
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.080]   a quarter as much right there's no that could be tweaked they also love the Mac I mean when the
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.120]   MacBook was introduced there was people and they tried to give it to customers first there were
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.560]   people at the campus just desperate to get their hands on the MacBook because it's the Mac they
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.920]   wanted and there's people desperate to get their hands on the new MacBook Pro because that's the
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.800]   MacBook Pro that they want and I think we've seen this with with iOS devices in the past where they've
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.120]   come in late coming just at the line we've had to wait till November or October November instead of
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.640]   getting them when they were first announced and I think there is part of it where they are just
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.880]   racing at that finish line as fast as they can and sometimes they run at a time and they just can't
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.480]   make it by that launch window and then it goes it just gets shifted into the next one but it feels
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.640]   very much to me as a culture that is like we're gonna get this as soon as we can if we if
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.240]   WWDC is one of those few things that we can't change if it was a normal event maybe they would
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.520]   have it in October instead of September but they don't control that schedule really do yeah that's
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.840]   set way in advance and if they just can't make it they're not going to show off a terrible version of
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.080]   it or a bad version or anything utterly anything different than a delightful version so if it has
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   to wait until they can do an event specifically for it I think that's just a hard choice they have to
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:10.000]   make. WWDC is Monday keynote is at 10 a.m. Pacific that's 1 p.m. Eastern 1700 UTC we will go live
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.920]   with our coverage here and Andy I think you'll be joining us on the coverage right? I will indeed
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.800]   that's good. Renee you'll be in the room. Yes Renee and I will be there and Daniel Bader as well so
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:29.760]   we'll have a good team there. And I guess it's important to say this is gonna be really about
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.120]   developers and not about products. Yeah and the OS is our products and they have a lot of features
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.320]   that make the products more valuable but I think that's absolutely right it's the thing about the
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.480]   software this year. Yeah I do think that they have a lot of empty tiles on the board that they need
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:51.280]   to fill in for Apple Watch so I'm hoping to see not just hey look we're now allowing custom watch
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:58.160]   faces or now we've got the now the digital stem you can roll it forwards at twice speed instead
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.880]   of half speed. I think that they need to really fill in here is what we here is what you're meant
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.080]   to do with the watch here is new capability that has we've been watching how people have been using
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.440]   the the watch for the past year that has informed how we want the next version of watch OS to exist
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.600]   and it has informed how why we have added these new APIs and added these new UI elements to it.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.760]   But other than that they I think they really it's just mostly going to be housekeeping it's a very
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.200]   very even keeled sort of thing for them to do. The hard if there's a fantastic hardware and
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.840]   fantastic new services to be had I'm not I haven't seen reliable information that it will be debuted
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.360]   at WWDC as opposed to a fall event. Although if you go to the website and you look at the
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:48.880]   seminar schedule there are some cryptic entries. Most all of them in Swift words alone parentheses
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.920]   cannot describe colon this one and parenthesis or top secrecy equals sworn to or keeping parenthesis
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.800]   quiet or kidding equals you got to be and then coronavation that's fine you can talk about courts
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.000]   all yeah. Swift API design guidelines that's public but splash zone seating come early.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.200]   What is that going to be so the most interesting thing to me is that it's being held at the Bill Graham
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.720]   Center and it could be that they booked that early enough that they thought there might be new
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.160]   max stuff that they wanted to show off because the last time they were at the Bill Graham Center
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.360]   it's when they showed off the iPhone and Apple TV and the new iPad Pro and they really they built
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.720]   living rooms for the Apple TV and it took up a lot of space and this year they're having the
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.520]   keynote and state of the union which is the internal the more even more developer focused keynote
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.600]   and the Apple Design Awards all at the Bill Graham Center and I don't know the the center
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.760]   well enough to know whether that's a larger capacity to host more developers or whether they really
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.840]   thought there would be a big hands-on room or whether there actually will be a big hands-on room and
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.640]   we'll see stuff like HealthKit or HomeKit or or something put on better display but I do think
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.520]   that the venue itself is interesting. It's it's really yeah some of these mystery ones are really
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.360]   kind of intriguing I must say. And there and there are a lot of things that could go in there
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.040]   that they they they're invested in force touch not just as a as a trade name but also as a way of
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.160]   expanding the whole experience and the way of putting more feedback through even a Mac even a
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.640]   MacBook trackpad is something that they've been looking very very closely at if the rumors of
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:21.600]   having an OLED touch strip as part of the standard hardware specification is true.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.880]   Obviously that's something that's going to require a lot of support and I bet they wouldn't do
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.800]   something as simple as here is here is step one key map it to the function key you wanted to work
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.400]   with step two upload a bit map that represents how you'd want it to to go. I'm sure that they would
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.680]   they will have they would have a design language and also a UI language that helps you to use that.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.960]   So the lot of little things that seem like little enhancements that would nonetheless require a
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.400]   lot of stuff to go. I'm when I say that I have heard nothing that only means that I have heard
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.080]   nothing and not like I hear about everything before before it comes out in advance. But I'm
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.240]   not I'm not prepared to hear that Siri is now going to be self aware and will now be going out
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.480]   and doing you know toasting your bread and making your English muffin for you every morning.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.840]   But nonetheless these small things can add lots of little niceties to the day-to-day experience.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.520]   But will require a lot of effort from developers in order to support. I should point out that if
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:24.960]   you double click the individual cryptic code that does tell you what category it's in. So gas
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:32.240]   equals do not even try is a graphics and games category. We bet you equals can't wait you know is
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.320]   is another app frameworks. This one's sealed under lock and key so you least know what category we're
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.360]   going to get interesting stuff announced in. So I guess that's so that you can go if if you're
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.000]   interested in app development you're going to go to the app frameworks. Yeah. Also think about
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.880]   the fact that in the past year Apple has released two brand new app platforms one of which being
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.760]   Apple watch the other one being the new Apple TV. So it's all of the and history has shown that
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.960]   Apple tends to make something functional with the first version particularly of the operating
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.600]   system and then they tend to fill in things that people have said they should have done
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.480]   from the start. And so we hopefully will see a lot more sophistication for instance with the Apple
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:25.440]   TV. I can't shake my hopes that Apple TV will be less of a home media streaming device and more
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.440]   of a here is a powerful iOS computer that is always connected to the internet and always running
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.640]   inside your house and all the different ways you can take advantage of the fact of having a powerful
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:44.400]   iOS device that is always aware and always on. It shouldn't just be streaming episodes of Archer
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:51.280]   on Netflix. As as as holy and sacred as holy and sacred a task as that would be.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.880]   All right. So Renee I should really be telling people in our promotional material for our coverage
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.640]   on Monday don't get excited it's going to be boring. Well I don't think it's going to be boring.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.160]   I think the iOS yeah I think I think the stuff we see for software is there's going to be some
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.160]   really really interesting stuff there. I just wouldn't go I wouldn't expect you big shiny boxes
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:16.640]   to come back on the show and no displays with GPS built in. No no or GPS. So if you go jogging
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:23.440]   with your 40 in cinematists play. If you leave your phone at home all you need is your 40 in
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   five case. I do kind of grin every time I set up a new Mac and it says do you want to turn on
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.440]   find my Mac and it's like well I don't think it's going to go anywhere but I always turn it on I
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.760]   guess if somebody stole it I it's right here in front of me what do I need to find it for.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:43.360]   It's right. Yeah. It's right. Yeah. What about the rumor that there was going to be a big refresh
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:51.440]   of iTunes announced at WWDC. You think that's the case or not? I don't think it's ready. I mean I
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.360]   just don't think that's just such a I think we'll see music updated and I think we'll see Apple
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:01.600]   music and new stuff there but iTunes itself when we start seeing Apple weaning people off
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.040]   traditional iPods and thinking them over cable on Windows I think we'll see a lot more advanced
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.160]   or when we see iTunes for iCloud when you can start streaming all your movies and TV shows and
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.640]   music right off the web I think that that'll be a big indicator that old iTunes is not long
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:23.920]   but we will see new Apple music stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I think that I think they have to talk about it.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   Um they have. I mean they they have to talk about it. It's I think that's the one thing that I think
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:36.160]   would be a lot of people saying what's that smell in the room that that they're not mentioning.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.640]   It's oh it's iTunes and they seem to be so ashamed they're not talking about it.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.960]   Drake has to come out in me a cult of the whole thing. Say sorry to the six and then put on a new
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:51.600]   version. I see Jimmy I have been and Drake. He's gonna come out in like coveralls and like a paintball
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.440]   mask and just stand by one end of the stage. Go ahead. Shoot me. As two random developers get to
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.000]   like shoot one and one only paintball at him and then DJ Khaled can show the new version. That'll be
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.600]   the DJ Khaled is showing people why the new version in commercials right? Yeah I heard that might
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.880]   happen but I didn't know if it would actually be real or not and it worked out not bad. Yeah I
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:23.520]   actually haven't watched it. Maybe we can cue it up and take a look. Um but it so does do we I
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.640]   haven't seen the ads do we see in a different looking Apple music or is it hidden is it? No it's
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.240]   basically a Siri ads. They're showing Apple music as one of the functions that Siri can do. Oh it's a
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.480]   Siri. They've been doing a lot of uh a lot of people just gave up on Siri. They tried it a few times
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.280]   and never went back and a lot of the ads now are trying to get you to give Siri a second chance.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:47.200]   Explain it to me again for for 999. Who always looks like he's wearing eyeshadow.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.840]   She could pick eyeliner. Any song and it's gonna come up on your phone as long as it's on Apple
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.720]   music. They just put the lens. There's thousands and thousands of songs. I promise you no way.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.120]   Challenge me. Do minute by minute by doobie brothers. Okay.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.400]   Minute by minute by the doobie brothers. Minute by minute by the doobie brothers.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:16.160]   Don't ever play yourself Ray. I'm telling you DJ Khaledid telling you.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:23.520]   No, I don't want you to play yourself right. Oh no mess with Ray.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:30.880]   Doesn't he look like he's wearing eyeliner? He's messing with you. He just mess with you.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:38.320]   Oh, you amusing me. It's like a little mini Sopranos episode there. Am I some sort of clown Ray?
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.080]   No, Ray. You said that I was funny. How did you meet that? Are you musicing to me?
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.520]   Because I must be musicing to you. I don't want to be musicing to you. Are you musicing to me?
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.640]   I wish Ray just whipped out a gun shot up. At least in the book.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.200]   Can't I run prime time? I guess you can't. That was a long ad. That can't be one to
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.760]   air down broadcast. I must have edited version from broadcast. Yeah, it's interesting how they're
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.560]   doing so for years they just totally eschewed celebrities with anything to do with Apple advertising.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.000]   And now it's almost all they do with Taylor Swift and with the as they did for Apple TV.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.720]   It's all celebrities all the time now. It's a very interesting change.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:23.520]   I have managed to avoid the viral video of Siri saving the life of a baby. I suppose we should
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.080]   play it. I just I don't I feel like it's link bait. There's no what does that mean?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.840]   Siri saves the life of a baby by calling an ambulance. How would it know? That's a better
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:40.560]   ad if it's true. Can we play that? I just want to see what that is. I know. I'm asking a lot.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.280]   Hold on. We're going to queue it up here. Were they getting a Manny Petty? I think they were.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:51.200]   Can you play the ad? Can you play the video? Getting a Manny Petty. That got my attention.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:58.880]   It's kind of an empty it. And how come you didn't save me Siri? There's a Lincoln chat. I made
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:10.640]   I made that drunken phone call. I'm gonna get my HDMI working so we don't have to do this.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.920]   I apologize, Carson. Where happened to Mark Gurman? Did he leave nine to five Mac?
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:22.640]   Yes. Here's channel seven news. I guess this is where we're going to see the baby and the ambulance.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.000]   A can's mom was able to use the Siri function to call. Can's mom is that's a straight? Stop
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.680]   breathing. Let's say Karen's strangely happy and healthy. One year old Gianna Gleason is lucky to
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   be alive and playing with her big sister Sophie. In March, mom Stacy noticed on the baby monitor
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:47.200]   Gianna had turned blue. She'd stopped breathing. I picked her up and sat down with her on the floor.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.520]   And called Siri. And I checked her airways. I looked over and remembered my phone. In a panic,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:59.200]   Stacy had dropped her iPhone. So she yelled at it. Hey, call the ambulance. I like how they
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.600]   believed it. I believe Siri because there's a chance iPhones will respond in homes across the
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.480]   country. Might have given the precious moments of Stacy. That's pretty cool. To revive. That's
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.080]   pretty cool. Instead of fumbling to make a call, Stacy could concentrate instead of this like ad copy
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.760]   instead of funding to make a call. And Gianna was breathing again. With husband Nick often
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.960]   away on duty with a navy, Stacy. All right. We get the idea. Yeah. I hate to. I guess I
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.400]   sometimes I feel like it's my job to be a little bit cynical in times like these and saying what
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.600]   is there is a story about how the time that Siri killed my killed my dog because I'd seen the
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   commercials about how you don't have to touch it. You can just simply yell out H Lomo. But I didn't
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.920]   have the right software update or I had heart where that doesn't support that unless it's tethered.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.320]   It's OK. That's nice. But it's neat though that it does. I didn't know this that you can make
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.560]   emergency calls. Yeah. It doesn't wait. It's it's implemented correctly. It doesn't like ask which
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:02.240]   which they're for ambulance services nearby. It's like, I don't care on ambulance. What's the syntax?
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.760]   Did you say call an ambulance or should you say call 911? Well, in the US you'd say maybe call 911.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.920]   Yes, it tries because it's very it depends on somebody thinking of that pattern. So, for example,
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.120]   I saw someone complaining that if they said, Hey, comma Siri, do I have a busy day tomorrow?
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.200]   It wouldn't say anything. But if you said, Hey, Siri is tomorrow busy, then it would say something.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.760]   So a lot of it is still it doesn't. Yeah, that's right. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.480]   how to depend on still? That's why I'm serious. These are all super subtle subtle things. Just this
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.120]   just about an hour ago, I wanted to be reminded. I was doing email. I didn't want to lose track
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.440]   of time and I had Alexa in 20 minutes. Please remind me to, you know, don't be fixated on what
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.840]   you're doing. Get ready for Mac break. And I started off by I use the syntax for setting an alarm,
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.960]   but I finished by using the syntax I would normally use for setting a timer, but it figured out
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.000]   correctly that okay, whatever he's just saying in 20 minutes, start making beeping noises. I can
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.440]   I can handle that. And that actually didn't press me because it would be the I think just a generation
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.040]   ago, maybe just a year ago, most devices would say, I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. It's I
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.320]   can't imagine how much work goes into particularly a function such as an emergency call, figuring out
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:20.640]   figuring out how many ways can someone say I need an ambulance right now or H H Lomo,
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.400]   I'm hurt really bad or H H Lomo, I need help or do I need a jacket today?
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.880]   Excellent. Yeah, so here's an article. Thanks to the chat room. How to use this is from my phone
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:38.880]   hacks. How to use Siri to call emergency services. If you're in the US, you could say dial 911 or
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:46.960]   call 911 or phone 911. You can say call emergency services, call the cops or call the police.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:55.040]   And if you're not in the US and you say dial 911, it will try to figure out what the emergency number
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:01.200]   is in your location. This is a touchy thing. And I'm actually glad Apple does this because there's
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:07.920]   also the risk of inadvertently calling 911, which would kind of not be too cool. Yeah,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.840]   there's a bear on the side of life. Yeah, but air on the side of life, exactly.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.320]   By the way, in this article, it says, please do not test out these commands needlessly. And I
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.480]   would like to reiterate, they'll work. You don't have to try it, although you will have five seconds
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.560]   to cancel. So but probably best not to practice all these companies take this super seriously.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:34.960]   I was talking to one of the vice presidents in charge of I think Nokia's mapping service
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.880]   at the time. And we were talking about how it's not when there's a hot when there's like an
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.400]   emergency room, it's not enough that to just verify that that is actually the address of
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.440]   emergency room. They in that case, they actually send people physically out to see on what street
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.440]   is the emergency room entrance. And is it a one way street? Because I want to make sure the people
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:59.200]   in that case, circling the block is no good. But what a real lifesaver. You could, you know,
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.560]   of course, in any phone, you know, use the GPS and the navigation commands to say,
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.880]   get me to the hospital. And that really is. Well, it's also it's also super important. I'd
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.640]   love to see Siri and other services when it makes the call to have Siri actually be able to specify
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.720]   to the 911, 911 operator, the actual location of the phone, because that's a problem. They can
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:26.480]   know if the person is not able to give them a specific address, all they can do is figure out
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:33.040]   via a nearby cell tower where something might be. And because the 911 services cannot locate
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.680]   your actual cell phone, it can only locate the car technology can only locate a landline. So,
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.400]   although there are and I have and 911 in the United States, 911 services are starting to
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:51.840]   upgrade. There are E 911 automatic GPS capabilities built into phones and but the not your local 911
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.920]   has to enable it, of course. And they have the right hardware. That's right. They have to have
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:01.360]   the capability. But in some jurisdictions, it is. And that is really cool. Because even if you can't
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.480]   say anything, they can see where the call came from. Let's take a break. Come back with more
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.080]   Andy and I goes here from the Chicago Sun Times, not trunk. I'll just say that from now on.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:18.240]   I'm sorry. That's me. And but it's not it's not funny. It's not about the Sun Times. Kind of funny.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:26.160]   From I'm or should we call it I'm Monk? No, no, but we can but it's funny from Monk Reol.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.000]   I'm or dot com Renee Richie. We're talking Macintosh more to come in just a second. I showed
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.120]   it. They brought you by it pro TV. We we kind of have a little bit of the same DNA. I think with it
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:47.360]   pro TV Tim and Don the founders were big fans of Twit and the the screensavers and of tech TV
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:55.840]   before it. And they decided we ought to really create something similar that makes it, you know,
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.960]   easy to get those it sirs, easy to get a job in it, easy to get better at your job if you're
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:10.320]   already in it. And that's why I T pro TV was born. High quality video tutorials to keep your it
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.760]   skills current, of course, and to get you a step closer to getting the it job you wanted.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:21.200]   More than a thousand hours of content now, and they're at new courses all the time because
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:27.040]   like us, they're streaming live about 50 hours a week. There's Tim. There's Don. They're streaming
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.000]   50 hours a week. And so you can watch live by the way, you can watch live with a free account.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   But if you want on demand and access to those thousands of courses, it's very affordable.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.880]   They even now and this is this is the I think the first IT video provider to do this
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.080]   have courses on sale at Amazon video direct. That's that new service Amazon just launched.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.960]   Of course, still, you know, you're probably going to want to subscribe to have the monthly full
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:57.840]   full access. But if you just want to get one or two or brush up skills in one area,
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:04.480]   I T pro TV's content is now available for purchase on Amazon. I love that courses include Mac

[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   hacker certs, which I just think that's so cool. I'd like to be a certified ethical hacker.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.760]   And man, what a great job, right? They just completed their SISA. That's a globally recognized

[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.480]   I think that's a great thing. Andy Leo and you continuing
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.080]   taking a look. I guess we've really covered now. WWDC. There's not much more to say
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.520]   about the Oh, I asked about Mark Herman. Where did he go? Do you go to Bloomberg? Yes, sir.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.480]   Interesting. Yep. Interesting. That's a big, I think that's a big get for Bloomberg.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.720]   Yeah, it looks like it's a really good relationship. Again, he's going to be get to do TV and cross
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.920]   technology, cover Amazon and Google and Apple and all the big players. Nice. And I'm sure he'll
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:08.480]   keep all his sources and get new ones in the other companies. Yeah. Yeah, no kidding. Good for
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:14.400]   Mark. He's only like 23 or something. He's a young guy. He's ridiculously young. And I still
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.880]   remember and I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this, but I still remember when he didn't come to
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.120]   WWDC because he was busy getting his driver's license. Wow. Oh, so he might even be younger.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.920]   Wow. Oh my god. Bait is our out though for El Capitan.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:36.320]   10, 11, 6, developer beta 2, TVOS 922, beta 2. Is there a watch OS and iOS update? No.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.360]   Just all of them are updated. All of them as usual. Okay. That's what they do now, right?
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.800]   They roll them all out at once. Yeah. It's just there. These are like, they're doing much
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.720]   more aggressive betas. They didn't usually do all the point point betas. They would do like
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:55.280]   0.2, 0.3. And now they're doing like 0.1, 0.9, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, which I guess good.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.880]   You know, but I mean, it hasn't stopped all the issues with them, but can you sure can't help?
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.080]   No, but I, and I like it that they are these public betas. Yeah, right?
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.200]   Oh, yeah. So the developer beta usually comes out a day before the public beta now, which is
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.920]   pretty quick. Watch OS 2.2.2. I like it when they do that because that means everybody can bang on
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.480]   it. And the more people to bang on it, the more likely it's going to ship without a showstopper
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   as iOS 932 did. That's been fixed. It didn't happen to me. It didn't happen to anybody I know.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:28.320]   It must have been a very small percentage of iPad Pro users who got bricked by that,
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.920]   but they've apparently fixed it. Now, what I don't understand is they didn't release a new
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:38.320]   an update. They did. I think was a few days ago, but it's not 932.1. No, no, it's a better version
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.760]   of the original update. Okay. So most of us don't won't get that because ours is fine.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.200]   You updated already. So what they did is they pulled the update and then they pushed that
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.400]   on you and you could still go into iTunes and hit restore and it'll pull out the new version for you.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.240]   So people who hadn't updated will get the new. Yeah. The rest of us won't. Oh,
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.440]   wait, unless you force the update, correct. And if you have a if you have an affected iPad,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.400]   that's what you want to do. Oh, if you got bricks, will it save it? I believe I saw a couple of
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.040]   people saying it came back in the brick, which is very impressive back from the brick. Wow.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.480]   That's like the Golden State Warriors. I didn't have I didn't it's one of the worst parts of this
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.920]   job is you want to get every bug so that you can help try to troubleshoot it. And I just couldn't get
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   this one. I tried it must have been a very weird combination of circumstances, something like that.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:27.280]   Yeah, but if it's if it's one person, if the one person is you, that's a big enough bummer,
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.600]   but it's sort of underscores why I don't have auto updates turned on for pretty much any device,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.520]   no matter what the operating system I liked. And I like to I like to make sure that if I've
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:41.200]   got a stable device and I've got a big business trip coming up or a big deadline coming that
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.720]   I've I've stable device, I can keep it stable by not changing anything about it.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.480]   It's a it's a bummer when you find out that oh, I this is a brand new phone. I forgot that
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.120]   auto update was turned on. And now this is not working though. I have to re I have to re certify
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.680]   for for Dropbox. And I don't have my phone with me. And now I'm kind of screwed. Okay.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.640]   Normally I try to go ahead. I was gonna say I try to do it immediately right away. So there
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.320]   are any problems I can tell other people and warn them. So instead of having an extra device to
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.480]   put betas on, I put betas on my primary device and then have an extra device to fall back on.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.560]   If anything goes to your backwards, you're doing it. That's the same reason like you do it. I think
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.800]   like you know what's it's in service of. Oh, we have to do it. That's right. No, I do that too.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.120]   But I actually have a totally separate table that has a totally separate I'm back on it and
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   totally separate device because just to remind myself that this is the device that that's
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.520]   automatically getting like brand new betas for the stuff that I count on every single day.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.680]   It's no, I could never find Miss Chira. It's an island in the middle of the office.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:43.440]   Does it have that scary warning? What was it? I thought, oh, this is so weird.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.720]   If the for the buried nuclear,
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.240]   fissionable material, did you see that? You know what I'm talking about?
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   I saw it on the hacker news. Let me see if I can find it because it was a while ago. I should have
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.800]   I should have bookmarked it. Warning Kodak has something in the basement. Oh no, it was scarier
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:07.600]   than that because of course this is a this is material that will be poison for 100,000 years.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:15.360]   So I don't know if I'll be able to find it. It was it was kind of it was kind of creepy.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.160]   Somebody put it. What's not happened? They found a nuke in the basement of the Kodak.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.640]   I think that was a lack of a lack of a story. Whoops, sorry. I guess we forgot about that one.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:34.080]   It was a film exposure we swear. Right. We're testing. Apple builds one of
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.840]   pretty much everything they could possibly build to see how it would work if you never know.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:44.400]   There might be like half pig like half olive loaf creatures somewhere in some cage in the new
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.400]   version of the art of the mask driver and the proton accelerator. It says this place is not a
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.160]   place of honor. I mean, I know that sounds strange. Do the voice do the voice. Is that
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.880]   the thing on iPhone? This place is not a place of honor.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:09.840]   Let's see if I can find the the image and the and the reason they do that is not for us.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:17.200]   But for an archaeologist that might not really understand here it is that might not understand
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.720]   what these symbols mean. This place is not a place of honor. No highly esteemed deed is commemorated
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:31.440]   here. Nothing valued is here. This place is a message and part of a system of messages. Pay
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.680]   attention to it. Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.840]   culture. And then it says 700 meters down nuclear material. And the idea, I guess, is to
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.720]   it's I don't know why they did this. Well, there's a lot of people who actually think about this
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:52.880]   stuff. There is there are this is for Sandy National Labs. And it was a report on expert judgment
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:58.000]   on markers to deter inadvertent human intrusion into the waste isolation pilot plan.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.920]   They are actually thinking about what happens a thousand years from now because we have material
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.000]   that will be still dangerous. 5000 years from now. You have to think about that stuff. Yeah.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.400]   And also, I do think that there are a lot of people who fancy themselves urban explorers.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:18.640]   Right. They need to if they they're used to walking past signs that are that they've seen before.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.240]   If they say someone actually took the time to write out a full paragraph,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.480]   this must be important. It raved it metal. Yeah, I get I get terrified when I see these viral videos
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.880]   of someone saw this. I saw this. There's this hatchet that would drive by every day and
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.960]   wait work and seem to have an old rusted lock. And I'm there. I had there was a staircase and I could
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:42.800]   go down and actually took me a whole like 15 15 to a minute or half an hour just to get I think
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.440]   I'm 80 feet underground. And now they're walking through tunnels not understanding that there are
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:53.360]   gases that are accumulating and grow. And it's yeah, they're the reasons why they put a lock on it.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.720]   One is because there are people that will very much die. You're you have to think 10,000 years
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:04.160]   from now. If it's an archaeologist, a speedlunker or you know, just somebody wandering around that
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.920]   they might say, Oh, this must be important because of these signs. It was
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.720]   it was experimental dematerializer finally starts working. Is there is there any chance that if you
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:20.000]   saw a pyramid, basically a structure that was built 5,000 years ago, just nothing but huge massive
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.960]   blocks that took immense effort in order to build right that it can be seen from miles and miles
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.320]   away. And that really you you seal dangerous things inside levels and levels and levels of
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.560]   concrete. And a lot of these structures as boring as they are, they kind of look interesting in
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.440]   their boringness. So yes, you could imagine 5,000 years from now, somebody thinking that this must
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.600]   have been some sort of a temple, this must have been some sort of an important government building.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.720]   And they would not put this much of a lock on the it would not they would not make it so difficult
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.680]   to get inside this thing if they were not something really, really important and valuable.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:55.520]   Just have going skeletons out front just going skeletons out front. Everybody.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.800]   I don't know how I got how did I get how did I get distracted by that? I can't remember it was
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   something you're talking about. You had a bunch of you max or something. We were talking about
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:15.280]   something having to do with Apple. Apple has a new patent. I don't normally cover patents, but
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.480]   I think this is a reasonable one for walk that might be something they do since they own beats,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.800]   water resistant speaker port and bone conduction earbuds.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:33.760]   I think it'd be you would want. I mean, how the iPhone 6s is surprisingly water resistant,
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.280]   even though they don't build as such. Yeah, it's gasketed and it's got sealed
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:43.520]   components on the board. So I don't think it hits P6, IP6, but I think that's why they just
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:49.520]   yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot of phones are like that where they the certification process for these
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.720]   for these levels is really, really difficult. And sometimes it's too much work to get that
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.920]   in line before a launch date. But nonetheless, you can have you can find a video of someone
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.440]   up leaving an iPhone 6 just underwater. And the screen still works just fine. And they pull it
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.400]   out 20 minutes later and the video is still playing or even like an an ex's phone. They have
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:16.480]   their videos like that. And clearly, when you do this, this assembly, they did not build this to
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.520]   not be not work well under hazardous situations. And I actually talked to a couple engineers at
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.320]   one company about this author record. And they're saying it really was that we priced out how much
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.680]   it's going to cost to actually get the certification, both in money and also in how much it would
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:36.640]   delay us to be able to put that on the packaging. We decided that so long as people understand,
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.320]   it's as long as people walk in the rain and their phone is fine. So long as people
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:47.280]   drop this in the tub and it turns out to be fine, that will be all the advertising we need about this.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.840]   Yeah. Better word of mouth and word of lawsuit.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.240]   Yeah. And then I forgot six, look at all the videos of it. And I actually saw it. I didn't
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:01.040]   click the link because I don't I have more better things to do with my time. But okay,
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.360]   what if we put the literally what if we put the iPhone 6 inside a pineapple and drop it off a
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.280]   hundred foot building will the pineapple protect the okay. It's you have two iPhones. What's the
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:17.440]   highest floor? You can drop them off. Yeah. And so I think that I wonder if these designers also
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.400]   know that at some point, someone's going to do a video. We decided to bake this inside Jell-O
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.640]   and leave it there for two months and it still works and they'll get all the they'll get more
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.400]   hits and more information from that than they will from a sticker on the side of the box.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:39.120]   It'd be throwing away. Mary Meeker gave her annual Internet Trends report. She's a venture capitalist
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:46.320]   and a longtime analyst of the technology scene. She's a K.P. Kleiner Perkins Coughfield and buyers
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:56.960]   K.P.B.C. or CB. And this is the chart that that the Verge says sums up the entire history of
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.880]   iPhone versus Android. Now I'm gonna have to I think we're have to parse this a little bit because
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:06.480]   she's not famous for succinct charts. And so the other thing is that it's always reported as iOS
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.040]   versus Android when it's really like iPhone versus every other front. I think that's a fair way to
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:18.080]   say it. Yeah. So on the on the up and down axis, the Y axis is global smartphone shipments in
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:25.440]   millions on the X axis. It's by year. So you could see it's a market that since 2007 since Apple
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:34.880]   introduced the iPhone has grown staggeringly into the 1.5 billion range. What a duopoly. I mean Black
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:42.880]   Berry is gone. Palm is gone. Windows even show Windows phone iOS is the orange slice. The light
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:50.240]   blue is Android. So the orange slice has increased year over year. It's bigger than all of 2008.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:57.520]   Yeah. It's hefty. But of course the light blue is is significantly larger. What would that what
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.320]   would that graph look like if it was money if it was money generated per unit? These are very
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.400]   different, wouldn't it? Yeah. These are these are all hauling devices. Again,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.880]   it's the difference between here is one company building every single device that runs this
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.360]   operating system and then the rest of the world essentially building every other phone for every
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.240]   other need. So if anybody is using this as a way of signaling that, Oh goodness, look how
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.680]   look how big or this bar is in this other bar is no, that's but you want you want the money,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   not the bar. The line might be the more telling one for both Android and Apple, which is the
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:38.720]   line shows the year over year growth. And you see it went ballistic in 2009, 2010,
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:45.200]   huge growth year over year. And it's been declining ever since 2010. And it's approaching zero at
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:51.520]   this point. In other words, we reached peak smartphone in 2010. Martians aren't buying
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.000]   we've tried. I mean, it's just once you greet every earthling, it's just not a growth market.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:03.760]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It reminds me of an interview I read years ago with the CEO, the then new CEO of
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:09.120]   Coke, talking about the problems. This wasn't the explicit conversation they were having,
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.880]   but you realize that the conversation that they were having in this part of the interview was about
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.280]   the difficulty of, is there anybody who does not know what Coke is? And is there anybody who is not
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.880]   left who is not buying Coke? And so he tells us they're in China, but they're doing some global
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:29.600]   stuff. And so he points to this, this woman who's selling like 1000 100 year old eggs or a car
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.920]   on a street corner. And I think that always it nice. He's talking about tradition and marketing
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.200]   and saying, well, I have to, we have to figure out how to get that woman to stop selling these
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.320]   traditional eggs they've been making for 1000 years and start selling Coke instead. And that's
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.960]   where you that's where you get into this sort of stuff where it's of course that line was sharp
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:52.720]   because smartphones did not really exist. Multistage smartphones only started existing then. So
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.360]   anybody who had an interest in getting it, it was people who were going to be buying them because
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:02.240]   they buy every new thing. And then the people as their as their feature phones start to die out,
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.120]   replace them with with smartphones. Now they're going to have to figure out once now that it is a
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.680]   really a truly a commodity item, how do you get people to switch and how do you make sure that
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:17.840]   you keep the customers that you're already have? The other point she makes here is that while
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:25.040]   unit shipments are declining for iPhone, the first year of decline this past year, 11% year over year,
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:33.200]   Android shipments are increasing 7% up year over year. However, if you look at dollar volume,
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.960]   it's kind of the opposite. So there's very little, I mean, this has bothered me for years,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.480]   it's the lack of sophistication, the smartphone market, because many markets were already segmented
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.880]   when they try to tell you, you know, what sort of what a premium car is going for, what our economy
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   car is going for, what our trucks going for, what is a premium segment. And this just
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.960]   loves all smartphones together. So it makes it hard to tell, you know, how much of this is
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.360]   China, how much of this is sub $300 phones, how much is sub $600 phones, how much of this?
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.480]   Well, here's where it's your main is that that's that many people using that operating system.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.280]   And so if you're a developer, if you're, you know, the app ecosystem, you're going to be paying
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.040]   attention to that. Absolutely. Kind of, but it didn't break it down by version either. And if you're
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.440]   using under iPhone seven or under Android, you know, whichever version you want to put the bar at,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.080]   you know, that is that the same target for developers, maybe not.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.880]   Right. Yeah. Remember that with Android phones, you can have a lot of success against the iPhone
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.800]   because there are people who cannot afford even like a three year old's third hand iPhone. You
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:37.120]   really have to find a way to make a really inexpensive Android phone that's tailored specifically to
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.560]   that part of the world that will have specific needs for both data bandwidth and how they get
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:48.000]   their news and information. And so you're talking a lot, you're talking about, yes, the brand new
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.960]   version of Samsung Galaxy, but you're also talking about something that's going to cost the equivalent
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:56:00.800]   of about one afternoons, the wages of like one one American in one afternoon to actually produce.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.560]   So that's why it seems, it seems as though the when you talk about the Android market,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:09.760]   there are at least 12 different platforms, 12 different 12 different setups, even when you're a
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:15.200]   developer. So a lot of these older simpler phones, they're still running Android 2.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.200]   Whatever. And that's as that's like running Apple to DOS really,
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.320]   compared to the modern version of Android. So it's it's it's it's it's very hard.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.400]   What are developers saying these days? Are they still agreeing with the common wisdom that
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:36.240]   Apple users spend more? You should do your iOS device phone.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.520]   Some don't care about money. I mean, it depends on I think it now is more sophisticated. It's
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.960]   like they try to do both and it depends on what you're targeting and you'll know
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.160]   what kind of user you want to target with that app and then they'll make a judge call.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:51.760]   We did have Mitch wait on triangulation yesterday. He has a very expensive relatively expensive $15
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:58.560]   to $20 birding app. And I would assume if I just looking at it at that cost and that particular
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:04.000]   demographic that it should just kill on iOS and in fact he did ship it first for iOS.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.240]   But he said actually the Android market is is really swapping the Apple market.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.680]   I believe that some things are underserved like pocket cast at that for a while that they found
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.840]   the premium podcast market was saturated on iOS but completely underserved on Android.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.000]   So it made a lot of sense for them to target Android instead of I'm quoting Russell.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.440]   Well, it's just complicated is the point. It's not obvious. And for instance, there is and Mitch
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.560]   did say this an expectation on the Android side that everything should be free.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.200]   You know that you know, Android users don't don't even less than iPhone.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.560]   Those aren't the customers they want though. On the other hand, the expectation on the Apple
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:47.120]   side is for in app purchases, right? I think it's I think the data points out that almost nobody
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.720]   wants to pay money for for phone apps on both sides. I think you're right.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:59.280]   Yeah. And it's it really I think that an underserved point is that I I am in the habit as part of
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:04.160]   my really is part of my job is that I'm the guy on the subway who is trying to see what color
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:09.600]   your headphones are and trying to see through the case of your phone to see what kind of phone you're
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:15.760]   using. And when you start paying attention to what kind of devices people are using in 2016,
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:22.640]   the iPhone is just another phone. It used to be the absolute gorilla of the smartphone market.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:27.920]   But now there are about four or five different makes and malls of phones that I expect to see
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.760]   in a public space. And the iPhone is simply one of those models. And so it shouldn't really
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:41.440]   frighten anybody or surprise anybody that numbers for purchases of of of Android phones and and
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:47.360]   Android software is might be as profitable if not more profitable than what is on iOS. But it
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.720]   continues to be a problem that people just don't want to pay for software. There I think he said
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.960]   and I think this is correct. There are no in-app purchases on Android. Is that the case? Can you?
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:03.120]   I can't remember. No, I think I think well, I don't know. You didn't want to do in-app purchases.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:07.760]   I think there are the differences that with Android you have alternatives to doing in-app
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:14.480]   purchases. You can actually usually my my vector for buying Android software is downloading the
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.600]   free version and then getting so annoyed by the ads that I'll go back on the place store and buy
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:27.840]   the ads by the ad free version. And there's there's there's because you can actually also return an
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.400]   app after within two hours. There literally there's a two hour window that if you say, okay,
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.920]   this app stinks. I don't want anymore. They will actually refund your money. It's not as necessary
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:44.080]   to hide features away to the targeting stuff back. But you can buy of course. What am I thinking?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.920]   You can be. Yeah, because the EU was regulating in-app purchases on both platforms. Oh, that's
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.440]   just a kids. Yeah, right. Well, of course. And rightly so, I think.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:56.320]   Let's take a break. We'll come back with more Rene Richie from iMore.com and Ian Oco from the
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:02.480]   Chicago Sun Times. More Apple Talk still to come. Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront. If
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.400]   you're investing for the future, whether it's your retirement, your kids college fund, buy in a house,
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.800]   just a rainy day fund, you really have to think about where you're putting your money because,
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.440]   you know, you know, it's hard to get pretty good returns these days. That's why I'm really excited
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.760]   about this solution. Wealthfront.com. Now, Wealthfront is not a traditional investment advisor.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.840]   Traditional investment advisors charge you like one, two, three percent of what you have under
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.520]   management every year. And then, you know, they might do a checkup every month, sometimes every
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:43.040]   quarter. And that's it. That's an expensive price to pay for very little service. Wealthfront's
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.800]   kind of the opposite. One quarter of one percent. And they're constantly monitoring your investments.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.160]   That's because it's all in software. Software works cheap, but it works hard to do things like
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:01.760]   tax loss harvesting and diversifying and rebalancing constantly. It's not now we're not talking day
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.400]   trading software, but it's the same kind of technology applied to your long-term investments.

[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.000]   They'll ask you a few questions, surprisingly a few questions, to get a sense of your risk
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   tolerance, your time frame, and then they will put together a plan for you. In fact, you can get

[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:45.360]   what you're losing to fees, even those hidden fees, and how you can minimize taxes on that
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.720]   income. If you decide to invest, it starts as little as $500. That's the minimum investment.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.400]   Of course, you could put a lot more in. Many of our listeners have put a considerable amount in,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.200]   but here's the nice thing. Your first $15,000 because you came in via Wealthfront.com/Macbreak

[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:54.000]   of course, the designer of the iPod. Not designer. The father of the...
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.040]   The father of the...
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.680]   They put that up between Robyn and him. They got very attention.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.360]   Yeah. It's hard to say exactly what Tony did, but he did some stuff. He was in charge of the
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.920]   iPod division, right? Something like that.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.520]   He bought hardware or something. He did something. I don't know what he did.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.400]   But he's considered the father of the iPod. Before that, he was with General Magic.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.240]   He left Apple to start Nest about eight years ago. Nest, of course, the smart thermostat company
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.480]   that's struggling a little bit these days and has been taking some heat from Alphabet,
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.360]   its parent company over at Google. He has left.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.800]   He was in charge of the P1 phone project at Apple and was his name, Scott Forestall,
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.840]   was in charge of the P2.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   The first iPhone. Well, they didn't think that they would be able to get what we got as the
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.120]   iPhone out in anywhere approaching a reasonable amount of time. And then it turned out they did
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.560]   it much faster than they expected. So the P1, which is sort of the iPod-based phone, never went
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.320]   anywhere. The Linux-y sort of based phone. So he did not win any of those arguments,
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.520]   neither did John Rubenstein. So it went to other pastures.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.440]   Yeah. At least he's doing better than the BlackBerry.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:04:00.160]   That's not actually not true, technically. People were hypercritical of him at Nest,
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.040]   because one of the things about people at Apple is that they ship, and yet at Nest,
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.400]   the story kept being that Nest just wasn't shipping. They weren't putting new products out,
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.040]   and they were having trouble with some of the features that they were adding.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.960]   You saw that headline that they were at that Google gave them unlimited,
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.240]   essentially unlimited funds to work on something new. And they never, and all they did was a
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:23.760]   smoke detector that flopped. Yeah. And the difficulty was that most of their, a lot of them,
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.440]   they acquired Dropcam and a lot of their products. A great product.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.360]   Exactly. And so one of the things that he was being faulted for was that the success of his
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.400]   division was largely due to the fact they bought a successful product that had been
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:42.160]   developed outside of Nest. They definitely had huge plans for Nest as being their home
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:48.880]   equipment, home hardware division. But you could already see sort of the cracks in the wall as a
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:55.200]   lot of products came out that you would expect to be under a Nest brand, but decided to be a
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:02.320]   Google brand or under a Nexus brand instead. And there was a lot of dissent.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:08.640]   And when you when there's a lot of people who are when an executive is getting that kind of bad
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:16.080]   press and that kind of bad attention, and his bosses are not saying boo in defense of him.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:21.520]   You know that they're just they've they've already picked a date, and they've already
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.720]   agreed that we will let you leave with lots of money and your dignity. And but we are.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.560]   Have you spent enough time with your with your spouse and your family?
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.760]   With family with your money. Exactly. So that's what his announcement basically said that I
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.480]   I'm going to leave. We will be more to entrepreneurship and a lot of other projects I'd like to do.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.000]   And this is not a laughing matter. I mean, I couldn't. A few of us could do anything with
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.600]   one fraction of success that Tony Fidel has done. But unfortunately, it just turned out it looks
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   like it was a management mismatch between his his style and the culture of the company because
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:08.080]   I have not I've never heard positive things about working working at Nest for many, buddy.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:13.600]   It's always been the same. The best stories I've heard about working at Nest were equal to
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.760]   the worst stories about working at Apple with an with Apple. There's always that person saying,
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.920]   well, I'm going to tough it out for another year because I really want to see this product get
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.400]   out and I really want to be part of this. But yes, this this job is crushing my soul and I want
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.680]   to have some soul left that could be put together back at the year. But I'm definitely going to
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.560]   wait until the next version of watch. I was a ship before I do that. It may be revisionist,
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.320]   but the story he's put out the story that oh no, I decided to do this long before,
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   you know, the problems surfaced between me and Google and I wrestled with my conscience
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.400]   for six months before I finally. I mean, he can't be happy either. I mean,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.320]   like as much as people in the company might not be happy, he can't be happy there. And it's
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.800]   interesting that there was a dynamic at Apple when all these guys were working under Steve Jobs
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.880]   and making these products that you can't just play, you know, pluck an individual out and say,
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:07.360]   oh, you know, he was instrumental in iPod, but iPod was Steve Jobs on down. It was an entire
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.520]   group of people and pulling any of them out and saying you need to reproduce that success.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.840]   Isn't probably not the best recipe for it. All right, let's talk about Elon Musk.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.840]   He's on his sleeping bag at the end of the line, Leo. He is making your car. Man. Yeah.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.320]   It wasn't that interesting. He's actually, they said on the on the floor there of the Tesla
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.680]   plant, sometimes sleeping there to keep an eye on things. Does he jump in with a wrench? What
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   does he do? And I don't. You matter. I'm trying to assemble his car and Elon is just staring at me.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:43.760]   With those eyes. Fascinating interview at the recode conference. You know, he wants to evacuate
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.520]   a planet. He's not sure exists. I mean, that was that was the most interesting thing for me. Yeah.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:53.200]   Yeah. That's a good way to put it. So that's two different sections, but you could brought
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.640]   them together. He says, yes, we're going to all go to Mars because we want to evacuate the earth.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.200]   And then of course, the one we spent some time talking about on Sunday, he says,
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.720]   the chances that we are in base reality, that that is real reality or about one in billions,
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.280]   very, very unlikely. He thinks we're all living in a simulation of some kind.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:19.040]   And that makes a fairly good case. This is one of those things college students stay up all night
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.160]   debating and have for years, depending on what they've been imbibing. Yes.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.880]   He Colorado. He even said, he said, my brother and I used to go back and forth on this so much to
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.960]   the point that we actually had to ban it from the hot tub conversation. Hot tub band.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:39.120]   Yeah. But he also talked a little bit about Apple. He says, he's not worried about Google.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:45.600]   Google's done a great job at showing the potential of autonomous transport, but they're not a car
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.640]   company. So they'd potentially licensed to other companies. I wouldn't say they're a competitor.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:57.040]   Then Walter Cara asked, what about Apple? And yeah, Elon said, that'll be more direct.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.080]   He said, they may be a little late to the table, though. I think there'll be volume,
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.480]   there'll be volume production no sooner than 2020. That's not that far off. That's four years off.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.960]   But then he said, in rhetorical question, is that too late?
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:20.080]   He also said, Apple's great, great. I think it's great. They're doing this. And I hope it works out.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.520]   He's kind of conflicted about how he feels about Apple. Yeah. Because the other,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.280]   he said before, Apple's the graveyard for defecting Tesla employees. It's almost like a borderline
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.120]   thing. I hate you. Don't leave me. Yeah. I think that not a few of us have that kind of a love
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.400]   hate attitude towards Apple, to be honest with you. You could say the same with me. I love you.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.360]   Don't leave me. I hate you. Don't leave me. What did you, anything more to say about that? I mean,
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:55.200]   it's a, I think that it's kind of spot on when you talk to Google about their interesting cars,
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.960]   they don't seem to be terribly interested in manufacturing something they're going to sell to
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:04.480]   people. They do see, they do seem to be thinking a lot bigger than that. The problem with, however,
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.840]   talking about what Google is doing, excuse me, what Apple is doing is that nobody knows what
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.480]   Apple is doing. We're assuming that they're aiming themselves towards building a production car that
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:20.080]   will then be sold to people or at minimum be sold in fleets to government and to universities and
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.200]   stuff like that. But we don't know exactly what their target is. Tesla has been focused on being
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.920]   a battery company and a car company. And they've been shipping, shipping, shipping, and they've been
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.320]   shipping, they've been shipping new cars that have some problems with them. But they've been
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:40.240]   shipping and iterating and shipping and shipping. So it'll be, I'm still fascinated by the prospect of
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:49.120]   is Apple capable of doing a real car, as opposed to we're going to do something that is a good platform,
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.800]   we're going to ship this and see what happens. They do seem like the sort of company that would
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:00.720]   wait until, hold off until 2027, because they don't really like those door handles. Do we need
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.280]   door handles to get inside cars? Touch ideas in their handles.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:13.200]   Yeah, and I think that's all true. Apple famously, they waited until markets were mature. It's the
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.760]   Tim Cook Doctrine, it's Horace D'Eddio called it, where they want to make sure that they look at a
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.000]   market and decide that they can provide compelling value and not just make an Apple version of an
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.760]   existing product. And if they can do that, and they can own the technology end-to-end, and they
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.000]   can provide a significant contribution, then they move forward. And they do that with an incredibly
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.320]   few products. And that's that whole mantra, a thousand nose to every yes. You have to build
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.560]   prototype experiment, think about a thousand products and say no to them until you get to the
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.880]   point where you're going to say yes to a couple of them. And at the same time, everyone's saying
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.480]   Apple needs something new, they need a car, they need VR, they need something, we're all saying Apple's
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.560]   doing too much, they need to slow down, they need to focus on a couple products. So I think that
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.640]   they'll continue to do that. And the car is just such a big endeavor that it behooves them.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.560]   If they're even thinking about it, considering it to get involved years and years in advance.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.400]   Well, you have to- I don't know if that's necessarily true anymore, though. We only have one,
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.680]   we only have one data point, unfortunately, of what Apple products are under Tim's,
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.480]   Tim Cook's leadership. And that's Apple Watch. And that is nothing if not just one of those.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.880]   There's nothing really innovative about it. The manufacturing is innovative. The styling is
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.840]   innovative. But there is really nothing you can say about the Apple Watch. You can't say about
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.880]   pretty much any other smartwatch that's out there, at least nothing that's positive.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:35.760]   So I wonder if they would be willing to simply- if part of the new character of Apple is to elevate
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:43.840]   the importance of styling in the equation. Say that we would- the old-fashioned Apple would be,
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.480]   we're not going to make a car- if we wanted to do a transportation product, we're going to do
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.800]   something that's absolutely brand new that no one else can do based on the information that we can
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.360]   collect off of how people have been reacting to other products. Maybe the new version is that we
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.640]   think that people are underserved by their current cars. That's not as pleasant a place to be during
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.920]   the 90 minutes a day they spend inside there. They feel as though that car design has been
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:14.080]   stagnant for the past 15 or 20 years. And we can give design the kick of the pants and manufacturing.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.520]   The kick of the pants has been sorely needed. Famously during- was it- when the Apple-
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.720]   when during the the the halo of coverage of the Apple Watch, there was a really deep
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.360]   interview with with with Johnny Ive and the rest of the design team talking about how much they laugh
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.720]   at- how much they laugh about current car design, how much they make fun of cars that they walk past
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.280]   in the parking lot. So I could imagine them saying that the way that we're going to add value and
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.400]   innovate is going to be in design if not in the way that this concept is being articulated to the
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.400]   consumer. Yeah, I think the watch was different. But I think that also explains a lot about it.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.600]   Like with the purple project, they hated their phones and they thought they could make a much
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.840]   better phone. They didn't hate their watches, but there was a point when they did the Gizmo
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.080]   project where they thought that health was super important. The best way to start addressing the
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.160]   health market, which you know fitness and health and medicine, you needed the device to actually
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.840]   be on you. They needed sensors that could actually touch your body and do readings. And the best form
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.920]   for that to take was a watch. And the digital watch, the computer on your wrist, wasn't as
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.000]   evolved as the phone or the tablet was at the time. So it wasn't as much ability to look back and
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.920]   see the watches. They kind of developed it concurrently. So I don't think it's so much that it doesn't
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.720]   add to the existing watches, is that they were developing it at the same time as things like
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.600]   Android Wear. And their take on it was sort of focused on health, but then it got a little bit
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.480]   confusing with the digital touch and some of the other features that they added. Yeah, I still think
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:43.600]   that I really wish that I really wish that they had focused on making a totally health focus
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.480]   wearable. Something that is really more like a wearable band than like a watch. I think they
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.200]   could have done something amazing that people with it. Apple is in the wonderful position of
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:15:00.480]   tricking people into wanting to use a health device by making a making a stylish band that
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.480]   doesn't necessarily cost 500 or $10,000. But it's so cool the way that it works and it integrates
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:12.080]   with your phone so well. And the data collects, contains such a wonderful picture when it's put
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   into the cloud and they do some number crunching on it. I think they could have had a truly
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.280]   exceptional fitness band instead of a, okay, they have a watch. Yeah, I think we'll see. I
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.600]   think Jeff Williams organization is doing a lot with medical stuff and they're just avoiding the
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.760]   consumer products or avoiding things that would take lengthy FDA cycles to approve. But they're
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.720]   probably experimenting with other stuff that might be more medical and require a deeper, longer product
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.160]   lines. And I'm sorry, I didn't mean this to be a tear on on Apple Watch merely merely saying that
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:48.000]   I were asked maybe in the pre Apple Watch days, I would have felt as though we're not going to
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.200]   ship something we're not going to ship something for the sake of shipping it. We're going to make
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.760]   sure that we're doing something totally new and totally bold. I don't think that that the Apple
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:01.040]   Watch makes me think that maybe that's not as important a factor as it once was because again,
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   they could have held off on the Apple Watch or they could have shipped something different
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.800]   from what they did. Even Android Wear is a significant, has a significant point of view that's unique to
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.480]   Android Wear. Whereas again, Apple Watch to me just is no point of view whatsoever. It's just a
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.400]   gadget watch with fitness features on it. They said no to monsters television Andy.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.840]   Yeah, it's got to be very hard to find a follow up to the iPhone. I mean, that no company's ever
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   really had that kind of credit. And I think there's far enough not to even try. I think they're
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.080]   just trying to do whatever they think is the next whatever the next project that they think is
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:41.040]   important. I don't think you can't be cynical and think that they're so full of themselves that
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.520]   they feel as though they're going to change the world with every, they feel as though that they
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.240]   have to one up themselves with everything single thing they do. Again, one of the greatest powers
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:55.280]   of Apple is that they have the ability to determine their own destiny. So I do think that the only
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.920]   things they put in the product line are things that actually interest them that they're actually
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:05.520]   fascinated about that really gets them excited about getting this to the ship date. And so
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.880]   that's why they don't have a million different things in the product line is it. And also,
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.760]   I don't think they're trying to if someone wants to say, Oh, how come you're how come you're not
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.640]   working? You don't seem to be shipping the next iPhone because we're shipping tens of millions
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.520]   of the current iPhone at high markup to people all over the world who are camping out to get them.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.360]   And we're going to make the next thing that follows that when we are ready to create it and ship it.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:35.920]   The fact that we have our rent paid until 3148 AD means that we don't really have to stress out
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.760]   about having about the next news cycle and the next announcement.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.600]   What is the connection between Apple and Muhammad Ali and why is he on Apple's front page? I mean,
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:51.120]   no disrespect from Muhammad Ali. I mean, absolutely. You know, a significant
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:56.560]   different campaign. Yeah. So if you were in the think different campaign, you can expect to be on
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.840]   the front page of Apple when you pass. I think if you if you're part of the
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.880]   think different campaign, you had a tie to Apple and they believe that you did a
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:09.200]   successful contribution. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they've they've they've done for for other people that
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.600]   they just simply really, really like. I think it feels very personal. You know, I mean,
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:18.560]   how would we feel though, if Coles did it or Kroger's or I mean,
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.560]   Apple's are feeling it. It's still it's appropriate, I guess. I don't know. It just feels a little.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:31.120]   Apple's different. They're a different kind of company. And I guess that they almost are
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:38.400]   like people that we know. And so as one might tweet, you know, so sorry to see Muhammad Ali's
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:44.160]   passing and that's fine. When Apple does it, it's different from some other company.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.080]   Well, you can tell I mean, there are certain people who just affect our culture to agree that
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.760]   my Twitter feed lit up when Muhammad Ali passed away. Sure. Did it when Nelson Mandela
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.400]   didn't do it for Prince. My Twitter feed lit up for Prince too. That no, that's entirely true.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.840]   I just think that there's certain there's certain focuses that Apple has and some in part of that
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.080]   as civil rights and part of that is the that whole thing, different campaign that sort of
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.880]   it creates a confluence where they make the decision on that. Yeah. I think it was a legitimate
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.280]   sincere tribute to that. Oh, no, I'm not not. Oh, no, I'm just puzzled because well, A, the confluence of
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.640]   I mean, it's this is a commercial enterprise. And what they put on their front page and take over
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.760]   their front page like this with this, there's something to be said there. And their choice of
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:31.040]   who they're going to do that for is interesting as well. It's so rare that they don't really have
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.320]   to worry about it. Google, I think they're kind of regretting. If there's one thing they regret
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.920]   about the doodles is that if there is something that like, I don't think they change their doodle
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:48.880]   for Memorial Day this year, which causes everybody to wonder how come you put this other person,
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.040]   this other thing as a Google and let me go through the history of everything you've done. Oh, you
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.840]   did a Google for that. That's not as important as a memorial thing. You did an international
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.400]   international thing for this thing that only affects people in Eastern Europe. Why did you?
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.280]   And sometimes you really have to explain that there is no master plan. There is no
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.240]   ranking board that says that the birth of Jesus Christ is the most important thing and that
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.600]   will always supersede everything else. And then the death of Jesus Christ will also be the number
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:25.280]   two on that. And now we're going to have a sports event. Now, where does that rank on this? Is that
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:32.640]   more important than the death of a civil rights leader? Or is it less important than the invention
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.920]   of something that we think is really, really important? Sometimes these are companies that
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.920]   are run by people who do things because it occurs to them and because they think it's a good idea.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.400]   And once you start to say that, why did you do this instead of that? Why did you honor Muhammad Ali?
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.000]   But not Richard Feynman. Why did you do that? Well, I would almost say just don't honor anybody.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.440]   I mean, you're you're you're you're a business. That's that's no fun either.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.960]   Steve Jobs, Bill Campbell. You can personally, I think Tim Cook should
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.480]   you know, do whatever he wants in his Twitter feed. But it just seems a little odd. It's a it's a
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.120]   bit I think it's a bad it's a bad call to say that we're not going to honor anybody because we
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.720]   don't want to offend people by leaving anybody out. I think that's a bad call to it's a some
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.040]   people are going to be upset. I'm not necessarily saying that the people who are up who are going
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:22.320]   to get upset are wrong to be upset. But that's their upset. I'm not upset. I'm not talking about
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:29.840]   you. I'm sure when Bob Dylan passes, they'll put Bob Dylan on there, right? Because he was in the
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.680]   so I mean, it's that kind of makes sense to think different people who by the way, were they
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:41.760]   involuntarily conscripted into that? Or I presume Apple licensed all those images. I think they
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.680]   would have to. Yeah. But I mean, I don't think you know, nobody asked Albert Einstein because he
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:54.320]   was long gone. I'm sure I'm sure you can't put a someone's face on a billboard. No, you can't.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.200]   Yeah. Without that with your logo on it and that not be constituted in advertisement. So I'm sure
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:07.760]   they did. Well, anyway, yeah, he's there. The greatest there. Yeah. I mean, I think you could
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:13.760]   argue that now I'm not gonna argue. And some he's punching you right. I know it's an interesting
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:20.400]   picture, by the way, who's who's who's surprised that his knuckles don't look like beat up steel
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.200]   hammers that have been beating iron for four lives, remember? That is the post. I mean,
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.040]   my thing. That's true. But still always this from think different is that the thing. Okay.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.280]   So they have the right to that image. It actually it's one of the nice things is you it's it's
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:38.640]   you'd ever saw this image in all of the tributes to Ali. This was an image that Apple on so you didn't
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.480]   see the other images. Yeah, you saw a lot of the other images. This is a this is a nice one.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:49.040]   Oh, there's no concern. I'm just no, but it's it's an interesting conversation to have once you
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.760]   there are problems that you have once you're once you achieve a certain size and reach that
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.640]   you did not have when you were a smaller company where the only people who know about you and who
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.600]   are looking at your website or people who love you, right? Now that you're right. Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.960]   I think that anybody who has gone from having 500 Twitter followers to having 10,000 Twitter
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.520]   followers or God forbid 100,000 Twitter followers knows what I'm talking about. Suddenly, it's not
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.280]   just people who love you who are reading your tweets or reading your institute. Look at your
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:24.080]   Instagram feeds. It's just normal people. And if you think about how one out of every 10,000 people
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.840]   statistically might be just a total irrational hate bag. Well, congratulations, 10 of your
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.040]   followers are totally irrational hate bags. So that's going to factor into you're not going to let
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:42.000]   you not say something because of those people. Is it bad that Amazon didn't honor Muhammad Ali?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:51.120]   No, no, I don't I just feel like what you see. Okay, so I just I don't know it's I mean,
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.120]   if I'd seen a big picture of Muhammad, I guess I wouldn't I wouldn't be offended if Amazon did it.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.920]   It's not offensive exactly. It's just it seems like you're using something for marketing, I guess.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.960]   Well, it's also it's also sales, right? They plaster that up and then
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:11.200]   yeah, they're selling records, but I understand that. And also, they don't Apple has sort of a
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.160]   front Apple has a front page Apple has a lobby, so to speak on their site Amazon. It's very different
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.400]   is it? I guess that's the I guess that's my real point is Apple is such a different company that
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.520]   it can do things like that and it doesn't seem as big a small company. Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.880]   Yeah. Honestly, can you think of another company where if does anybody in this conversation or
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.920]   pretty much anybody who's listening to this doubt that if Tim Cook wanted to suddenly decided that
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:45.040]   I we want to make a sensor equipped basketball and if he decided that that's what Apple wanted to do
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.720]   that they would not start making it or at least they would not start building it to see how much
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.440]   it would cost to do it as opposed to other companies where I don't know what division would start to
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.280]   grab it. And then I don't know what I don't know how many people will be fighting each other to
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:03.920]   make sure that the project project sensor sensor ball does not get resources and manpower, excuse me
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:09.680]   and worker power from other divisions. It's this is this is still like Renee said the biggest small
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:16.560]   company in the world. You can have one absolutely crazy. I've just had wisdom teeth pulled out and
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.840]   unfortunately I had my phone with me while I was coming out of the anesthesia and three weeks later
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:27.440]   I don't know why I'm in a conference room explaining how the how the the duck that has a Wi-Fi
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.080]   transporter a transponder on its bill is now being pitched to me as something they've actually started
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.600]   to build. It's because I think that Apple would be doing crazy things if they wanted. I don't know
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.720]   you know I think they must have some corporate to more traditional corporate governance. I think
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:47.200]   if you're right Steve Jobs said I want to do a sensor equipped basketball the board would have
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.560]   gone his way. But I think Tim Cooks were asked to answer to the board and I think if he's going to
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.680]   if they're going to do something like that he's going to go to the board with it and the board
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.680]   could tell him no. Even with Steve I mean they pushed back on it. There was a couple of really
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.160]   good stories. I have another there's another episode of D about coming out with Don Melton and
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.040]   Gennatra and they share a ton of really great stories and one of them involved Tony Fadal
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.080]   where even though he was working technically on a competing phone with them they said he still
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.560]   shared invaluable information on how to successfully make a small electronic device things that would
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:21.120]   have taken them years of hard earned experience and it was an incredible benefit to what became
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.320]   the iPhone project and in other companies you know someone that radically opposed to your agenda
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.840]   probably wouldn't have shared of that kind of stuff. And the other one was early NFC talks where
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.160]   they were thinking about putting NFC radio in there and Scott Forestall and Oppenheimer at the
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:40.240]   time was the CFO were saying there's this is a chipset not a feature set. So even though some
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.400]   people wanted it there was a lot of pushback. And there are famous stories about you know Steve
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.720]   Jobs refusing to put iTunes on Windows and Eddie Q and Phil Schiller saying we're doing it and he's
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.880]   like fine screw you guys you've got to help you if you fail. But he was still smart enough to let
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   them go ahead. He was smart enough to get people who were smart enough to do what he didn't want
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   sometimes as well. I think that's one of the interesting parts of this culture is like yeah
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.120]   you know they'll try the addition watch and maybe not work. Maybe they'll push back. There's a lot
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.960]   of projects they didn't ship that maybe some people in the company really really wanted them to.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.200]   But it is a group of individuals who can push each other around in those situations.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.360]   You know there are those who say that Apple should have had Kimbo Slice on the front page.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.880]   Ah Kimbo. Ah Kimbo. We hardly knew ye. In my case I didn't know him at all.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:34.240]   The speaking of Think Different the creative director for the Think Different Campaign
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:42.480]   published an article in The Guardian Ken Segal saying has Apple lost its way Steve Jobs' love of
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.840]   simplicity is gone. He didn't say that. He actually put up an article saying that was not his title
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.480]   and his title was a question and the actual content does not match the title that The Guardian
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   put on. Damn those headline writers fooled me again. He wanted to discuss the issue and he has
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.400]   points on both sides of it. But he does say that natives are getting restless and I think that
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.920]   if there were a subtext to this whole show that might be it. The natives are getting restless.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.840]   Tim Cook has a different style. He knows how to make Apple run efficiently. He recognizes he
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.400]   doesn't have Steve's many talents. So he relies on the expertise of others where he is less
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.520]   experienced like product design and marketing. And that's where things get a little more complicated.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.400]   Well so did Steve when it came to operations and a whole bunch. That's why you hired Tim Cook.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.760]   I mean they're smart enough to know that the big people they need in those companies.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.920]   He says Apple now sells three different iPhones, four different iPads, three different MacBooks.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.680]   The Apple Watch comes in a seemingly infinite combination of sizes and bands
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.560]   which Renee Ritchie loves. I mean the performer came in a huge.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.160]   Yeah the Apple universe is exploding with complexity or is it? That's the real headline.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.480]   Is it? iPod stock, Steve Jobs, ship iPod stocks. I mean let's do it.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.840]   Right. He says are they really that complicated. The company's entire selection of products can
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:10.320]   easily fit on an average size table. That's true. So yeah I think you're right. I think this headline
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:15.520]   is not fair to what he's really saying. He corrected on his blog. I think I stuck the
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.320]   link in next to the. Yes you did. I have to me. It's important to remember that there's a long,
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.560]   long tradition of editors writing headlines for stuff that other people wrote.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:32.160]   There are a number of times of the sometimes where I have had a very polite email saying yeah
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.440]   that's that you really need to change the headline. I'll give them three alternatives
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:41.520]   saying because that's absolutely not the point of this piece. This is not a take down of this company.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.800]   This is me saying that I like three parts of this. I didn't like two parts of it.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:52.080]   Yeah he actually he says it really not only the headline but the article itself misrepresented.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:59.280]   Contradicted he says his point of view for clickbait purposes. Sorry guardian and guardian.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:06.800]   So if you want to read the article don't read the don't read the guardian version. Don't read the
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:12.720]   versions of the versions. The third party versions offered by seeing that in others.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:21.520]   Greed Ken Seagal's version on his own blog. Ken Seagal's Observatory which is at K E N S E G A L L
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.520]   dot com. They really they really is a source of concern for me because you see a lot of people a
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:30.240]   lot of other sites that don't have something to run for 2 p.m. and so they will essentially
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.560]   rewrite something that they saw on another site and make it really different. They will quote it
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.640]   but and then mention with the sources but they will make it really hard for you to get back to
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:43.600]   the original source. So it really does become like a like a game of telephone where you start off by
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.880]   saying that I think I could I could foresee a here's the situation which I could foresee myself
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:55.200]   not using switching from a Mac to a Windows machine and then by the time the third source
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.800]   writes their pieces like Andy not going out to see through with a Mac like no I do not
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:07.840]   know but Mac live on television. Right. Let's take a break come back with your picks. I have a pick
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:17.120]   too but first let's talk books and audiobooks from audible dot com. I was just looking and they we've
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:25.440]   been doing advertisements for audible dot com since 2000 I think was 2008 seven or eight years.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:33.360]   I've been an audible customer for 16 years and I think everybody agrees at this point including
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:40.160]   all of our hosts. This is the best way to listen to books and I would submit the best way to
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.840]   read books because I don't read very much anymore because I've got audible and certainly when a new
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:51.600]   book comes out first place I go is audible dot com and see if they've got the audio version. Now
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   nowadays they almost always do because this is one of the exciting things about audio books is that
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.840]   publishers have finally realized that people want audio books and so audible has every almost
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:09.680]   every title when it comes out. Oh somebody was just telling me he's listening to Stephen Levy's
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:15.600]   classic hackers which is available in audible heroes of the computer revolution. If you've not
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:21.280]   read this you got to read this. This is a classic book was it you I think it was you Bruce yeah Bruce
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:27.440]   Shazemar engineering director. He says he loves it and I tell you I've read this several times
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.000]   Stephen's a great friend and I think this is a wonderful book but there's so many good books how
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.280]   about this one from Richard Feynman the pleasure of finding things out the best short works of Richard
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:44.960]   Feynman what a great book. The only thing missing it should be in his unique kind of accent he had
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:50.480]   such a strong I guess it was kind of a New England accent. Oh no it was a very Brooklyn accent. Brooklyn
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:56.640]   that's what it was yeah. It could be good but a cheap unco yeah yeah. I have some of his lectures
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:01.840]   of course on audio and it's wonderful. Yeah love Richard Feynman. There are actually quite if you're
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:08.160]   if you're into physics there's quite a bit of Feynman on audible including surely you're joking and
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:16.080]   this is probably the best thing you could listen to in his Feynman himself. They have all of the
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:21.600]   Feynman lectures the original audio of these. Bill Gates was reading the what they call in the red
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:28.640]   book the the text versions of these. This if you want to really now it's not for late it's
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.400]   ostensibly for laypeople it's not. These are his lectures at Caltech these are not for these are
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.080]   not for laypeople by any stretch of the man. Listen to a little Richard Feynman though I mean it's
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:45.120]   great to own this just to have it. His memoirs are good to play. I can't I can't even guess
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:51.200]   as the number of people who have been had their minds completely bent into a completely different
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:57.600]   but wonderful shape by being a teenager and listening to and what and reading or listening to
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:04.400]   surely you're joking Mr Feynman. Yeah. I was I was breaking into post office boxes almost immediately
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.240]   so awesome reading that book and it really doesn't change your it really just change your whole
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.640]   attitude about who you are what your responsibilities are in life to yourself and to the rest of the
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.600]   world and yeah give it to a kid it bent my brain in a very positive way. So we're going to get you
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:24.720]   your first book free if you go to audible.com/macbreak you'll be signing up for the gold account
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.720]   that means you get a book a month or a credit for a book a month most books are a credit 99.5%
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.800]   of all the books are credit plus you'll also get the daily digest the New York Times or the Wall

[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:45.920]   first 30 days it's fine thank you goodbye but you get to keep the book which is nice
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.960]   however I don't think you're going to cancel. What are you listening to? I'm looking for a new book
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.680]   Andy what do you listen to? Well it was as an automatic purchase Neil Gaiman has a brand new
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:01.040]   book out automatic. Yep. Yeah exactly it's a quick it's just clicked away from the first
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:06.240]   second it's the view from the cheap seats selected nonfiction it's a collection of 15 hours and 29
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.520]   minutes it is like a collection of all these little nonfiction pieces that he wrote like
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.800]   magazine articles introductions to books he has for instance the it they really lovely introduction
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:23.840]   that he wrote for a biography of Douglas Adams published after his death that's just full of
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:29.120]   just really nice personal stories about when he was working on his own biography of Douglas Adams
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:34.160]   but working with Douglas Adams and having a daily access to him and being in his office
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.320]   and it's a it's Neil Gaiman's writing again it's it's always an automatic particularly
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:45.520]   inaudible because he reads his own book and he is a monster he is a monster storyteller yeah
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.080]   and it's also the sort of audiobook I really really like to have in the collection because
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.760]   these are all individual short pieces for so there are pieces that are long enough for
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.240]   vacuuming the vacuuming the living room there are pieces that are long enough for doing the dishes
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.720]   there are pieces that are long enough for oiling the chain on my bicycle so you can start something
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.560]   and then say I'm going to continue to work until we get to the end of this chapter this the end of
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:13.760]   this entire piece and then you start fresh for the next day trying to listen to American gods
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:20.480]   on auto on audiobook I recommend it highly but you will be in the world of American gods for a
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:25.760]   good week and maybe you want to make sure that you pick a week where you can afford to be in that
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.920]   world your head in that world for an entire week this is stuff where you can really just dip in
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.320]   and out of it really really easily and this 15 hours worth of material here that's a good
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:40.000]   I when I when I recommend free books to take I'm looking for maybe don't get the 90 minute fresh
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.760]   air episode try to get try to get through something that will that's true that's true that's true
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:49.840]   meal yeah never where he narrates that that's really awesome and uh an ancy boys uh was one of
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.400]   my favorites there I think there's a couple of American gods there's a dramatization as well as
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.480]   red one and that's one of the things audible does really well is the the dramatizations I still
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.640]   have trigger warning which is his last book and I haven't listened to that yet so I've got I've
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:10.960]   got some gaming to do I'll tell you here's your chance your book is first book is free audible
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:21.440]   dot com slash mac break try it today I know you're gonna love it time for our picks of the week let's
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:27.040]   start with you rename richy so I got such great feedback from picking the arrow press a couple
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.480]   weeks ago people already had it or they went out and bought it and loved it but I also got
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.800]   feedback from people who don't like coffee and wanted to know what I recommended for tea so I
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:39.520]   put it in the show notes it's a I forgot the exact term is but this one's from david's tea but a
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.880]   lot of people make it and basically you put your loose tea in you add your hot water and then you
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:50.240]   put the cup underneath it and gravity releases it and it fills the cup underneath it with the tea
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.400]   after it is steeped you do have to make sure you take it off in a timely fashion because if you
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.360]   have too much water in there it will overflow your tea but if you don't it is a great way I was always
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:03.520]   sort of trying to figure out the best way to make tenuous and people have tea machines some people
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.400]   use tea pots I have a bunch of Chinese tea pots that I brought back from Guangzhou that I really
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.400]   like but it just it gets this was just so easy and so fast and so quick to clean and the nice thing
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.440]   about david's tea is that they make incredible loose teas they have all sorts of teasons like
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:25.680]   their herbal teas this is a green tea with roasted rice and an adopanese green tea with roasted rice
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:31.360]   which has got a really great flavor I love that yeah there I got a magic dragon which is a fruit
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.600]   cut they have and they have if you look at their teas they have actual like bits of mango or bits of
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:41.440]   or star anise in it it's really it's high-end tea but it's it's the the tonks or blue bottle
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:46.560]   equivalent of teas and I've been buying three or four cans of it a month I sort of try to rotate
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.680]   and get new ones all the time and it really is great they do ship in the us again it's not super
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.160]   inexpensive but if you know someone who really really loves tea and they have sample packets
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.040]   and they have a whole bunch of different kinds of infusers and just from the green teas to the
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:06.800]   herbals to I tried one the other day called tantis of saville which was a green tea with bergamot
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:13.840]   and just really really really good stuff oh the range you can get 18 ounces or 36 ounces
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.520]   you can get families you can go to family slides if you want to yeah that's a lot of tea
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.800]   embarrassingly I saw this for the first time when I was at a Japanese restaurant
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:26.320]   and they put it down in front of me and I wasn't sure how to use it I ended up putting it on top
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:32.320]   of what turned out to be the candle not my t-co I'm quickly overflowed it so I learned my lesson
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:39.440]   and I was hooked ever since this is cool so it holds the tea while it's steeping yes
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.800]   see I don't like presses and other things that keep the tea leaves in yes after it's steeping so
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.400]   this is perfect you then you put it on the cup it just comes out automatically you're done and if
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.880]   you enjoy Chinese teas a lot and you and you you like the different levels of steeping like the first
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.240]   steep the second steep the third steep you can just fill it with hot water and go through all
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:03.280]   those processes and it makes it's still super convenient wow I guess I like that you can see
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.000]   how much is in there yeah now how do you use a fantastic I guess you should use clear glass
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.840]   where if you're gonna do these 36 sounds because you get the timing you'll leave it on it's when
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.880]   it's full yeah you totally get the timing pretty quick I made a mistake the first time and after
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.320]   that I count like a few seconds I pull it off and then I add it just a little bit more if I need to
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:32.320]   nice I love this idea this is brilliant all right it's David's tea and it is starts at $20 it's not
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:39.520]   that expensive David's tea.com Andy and not go time for your pick of the week mine is a solution to a
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.920]   problem that I've been trying to solve for a while the Tony Awards is coming up on Sunday on CBS
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:51.200]   and it's going to be it's going to be Hamilton past it with a with a number from Hamilton it's
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.040]   going to be nothing but they're no nominee for 15 awards they're probably going to win 23 of them
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:01.840]   stay on the stage let's put it this way exactly and I used to have I want to record it and I want
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:07.680]   to be able to save it so it's part of my permanent video library unfortunately the solution that I had
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:14.160]   for a couple of years which was a piece of really antique software that would plug into the none
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:20.400]   and really none not well publicized firewire report on the back of my my HD cable tuner I could
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:26.560]   just DVR stuff and then get the HD program just push play then push record on this piece of
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:31.840]   this piece of Mac software I don't know whether Verizon pushed an update to the cable box it turned
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.480]   off the the firewire port or whether there was just a Mac update that made this software not work
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.480]   anymore but it stopped working so I was thinking I was I thought that I would maybe buy spend 100
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:49.520]   bucks on like a new iTV or something like that but then I found on on eBay excuse me on Amazon
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:57.120]   this incredibly sophisticated device called digital converter box ask ask for my name digital converter
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:04.800]   box it sounds dumb but I'll tell you this is a 35 dollar digital tv tuner like the kind that
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:11.440]   you're like 90 year old the grandmother has because she doesn't want to give up her 19 19 inch
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:18.160]   magnavox tv and she wants to get the tv signals on it it is a tv it is a digital tv tuner but it
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:25.520]   also has a USB port and if you have a USB storage device like a flash drive or even a hard drive
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:33.280]   it will record programs onto that flash drive and so you can set you can as a the online programming
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.200]   guy that's free because it's just getting that off the air you can set up a record you can set up
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.520]   recurring recordings you can even just simply you're watching something and then just press the
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.080]   record button on the remote and we'll start recording to this device it doesn't record in
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:53.360]   like mp4 format it records in a like the same digital format that you get like off of a cam
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.240]   quarter so you do have to you do have to dump it into handbrake and or turn to an mp4 but you will
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:07.200]   wind up with a 1080 HD HD full stereo full everything version of this program that you recorded off of
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:14.240]   off of the air and so for 35 bucks it's pretty damn good I wish I'm afraid it's still plugged into
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:18.800]   my system so I can't I couldn't show it to you but it's also it's not built like a piece of junk
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:26.080]   it's a full metal full metal case it's got a LED display up at the front it comes in I don't
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:34.000]   I don't want to be snarky but I have to point out that this is a $35 or practically no name device
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:41.040]   and it comes with a remote it comes with a full remote that has contoured stuff on the back that
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.720]   makes it really comfortable to hold and like buttons that are easy to find and easy to push
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.360]   and if you're holding it upside down it's really easy to feel that oh my goodness I'm holding this
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:58.080]   upside down unlike the remote of some other digital device that I could mention also it comes with
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:04.720]   like all the cables you need comes with HDMI cable comes with analog cable unlike some $150
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:11.440]   TB devices that I've used it comes with a full instruction booklet printed again unlike something
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.880]   else that I paid five times as much for but it's I was surprised I really did I bought it just
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:21.760]   hoping that I could record this one show and maybe get a column out of it and if it does those two
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.080]   things I'll get 35 bucks out of it but I'm actually really really pleased with it I've got it set to
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.200]   record every single episode of the of the Colbert show because sometimes there's a guest on that's
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:37.280]   so good you just want to have that have that forever it's also I'm kind of looking into getting maybe
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:44.160]   a not too expensive AV receiver and so the ability to simply have TV tuning just as something I've
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.560]   got plugged into the receiver instead of plug unit instead of having the antenna plugged into the
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:55.200]   TV itself is going to be a big asset and as I keep moving further and further away from
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:01.360]   from conventional cable and conventional TV the prospect of now actually hooking up cable in a
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:07.520]   cable box into my living room is even it comes more ridiculous with each passing week but now I've
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.880]   got something that I can actually be recording things digitally the few things that I watched
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.760]   that are on the air and actually add them to my my library and it's just 35 stinking bucks and if
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.800]   you really are that cool that much of a Hamilton fan you can certainly order it today and have
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.600]   it delivered before Sunday which is why I picked it for this week I just wish that I had it a few
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:35.040]   weeks ago PBS had one of their great performances specials it was from Lincoln Center the Metropolitan
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.920]   Opera's production of the Pearl the Pearl divers starring a name that you've heard me say before
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.360]   Diana Domino and I came so close to spending a hundred dollars I've got I've got an ITV I just
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.480]   don't have a copy of the software and I would it cost me 90 dollars just to buy and download the
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:56.000]   software and I'm I just kept telling myself do I really want to spend 90 dollars and then I'll have
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.480]   to have a Mac running all the time I'll have to find a way to plug the antenna into it wherever I've
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.520]   wherever I've got the the Mac set up this is actually much much better because it's uh it has antenna
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:10.720]   in and antenna out so I can just simply put it between the antenna and my TV and I just simply
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.960]   get all these extra features for free plus everything else what a great idea wow why you know there's
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.040]   all these things that you know the home run and all that that are so expensive and this just
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.360]   does seems like it would do everything you need by the way it's 40 dollars if you want all the
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:30.640]   fun things that Andy was pointing out the antenna that remote no no it's it's 35 dollars for the
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:36.080]   for a price you didn't get the bundle for 40 dollar but the 40 dollar bundle includes an antenna
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:41.600]   that may or may not be great so if you need it if you need an HD antenna then definitely fine
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:47.120]   bucks it's maybe it'll be a good one bucks you really have to you really have to place the antenna
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:52.240]   really carefully in order to make it work with no matter what kind you have but it really came
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:56.720]   down to I for a hundred bucks I would have had a solution that would have recorded stuff and
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:02.000]   automatically recorded as an mp4 and automatically put it on a server and I could have an app the
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.040]   iTV app that will let me automatically stream it wherever I am I didn't really need that I just
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.320]   want to on certain for certain special occasions and a couple of different shows just record them
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.720]   and put them on a flash drive and then at my leisure convert them manually and manually put
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.880]   them on my server and that's perfectly fine for me so the key of course is good over the air signal
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:26.640]   which unfortunately we don't have here but if you've got that then you can do everything else
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.640]   over the top with internet and you're you don't need a cable subscription as long as you've got
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.120]   good over the air yeah well I see the thing is I found that I do need a cable subscription for a
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.880]   couple of shows that I don't want to have to wait for like like archer like a couple but I found
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:47.600]   that but I realized that I also have a CBS subscription the I subscribe to the streaming
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.880]   streaming service because every show that I look every over the air broadcast show that I look
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:48:00.480]   forward to seeing is either on Fox or CBS and on no other channel and Bob's burgers and the Simpsons
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.440]   and those are already on Hulu and I get to capture all that other stuff gets a watch all
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:10.880]   it's the other stuff through the CBS app but you'll be surprised at how much good stuff there is
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:16.560]   that's out there over the air and the ability to simply grab it and and keep it forever and ever
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.680]   I still I still have like the last Letterman show and the first Colbert show still on my DVR
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:28.400]   only because I can't delete it or let them be deleted until I figure out some way of getting
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.800]   it off there even though I have to just simply hook up a VCR to it right and then
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:36.640]   turn it to a DVD or something but this has no copy protection right you just put it on a hard
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.800]   drive and now you've got a digital copy that over the air signal again it's it's it's great I don't
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.200]   believe it works with a with Clear Kwam so I don't believe you can make sure it does I don't
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.560]   I don't believe you can hook up your cable to wait a minute it says not officially supported yeah I
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:55.360]   I haven't I haven't tried it yet it's possible that it might work but I have a lot of times these
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:02.160]   Chinese boxes don't you know they're very clear oh no we don't do any of that and then surprisingly
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:10.720]   they do yeah I should maybe I should look for a firmware update yeah yeah that has a bug in it
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:17.360]   we put all of these converters that seem to somehow strip out copy protection I don't know
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.480]   you will have to climb the pole outside your house to get NBC right
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:30.080]   don't accidentally put the red wire into the green spot or else you'll get free cinemax and
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:34.960]   you don't want that to win want that hey by the way good good find this is great view tv
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.480]   you know what go to Amazon and search for view tv at 263 because you're never going to find it
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:43.600]   otherwise and this was this was they they had a different model that they've spent on for a
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.920]   couple of years this was this one was just updated and just released a couple of months ago
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.800]   and it really looks at it's it's actually a very I love these little things where it's like 35
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:57.680]   bucks but it doesn't look like a cheap it doesn't look or function like a cheap piece of junk it
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:03.200]   actually looks like those people who cared about having a good experience creating a good experience
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:10.400]   created this and as I as I said I I recorded two hours of soap operas testing it out yesterday
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.600]   and it worked perfectly fine yeah I imagine they actually sell these somewhere as set top boxes
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.680]   they have to be cheap cable companies wouldn't use them maybe they're saying there are a lot of
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.800]   people who are stuck with old TVs or it's even good like there are a lot of people I'm sure who
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:29.920]   are listening who have like like the monitor I'm looking right here it is a really good HDMI
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.320]   monitor doesn't have a TV to enter it but maybe they want to have one of these have they have an
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.040]   old screen that's not doing anything and they wouldn't mind having a TV in the office by the
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:43.760]   way this is great that even the the notes say you know go to antenna web.org type in your zip code
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:48.240]   to find out if they're broadcast towers near you don't purchase this for cable use it will only
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.040]   work with the encrypted channel I mean this is surprisingly clear and straightforward they were
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:59.280]   like that's a super that is super important I didn't start getting good signals just historically
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:07.200]   until I finally bit the bullet and bought about a 50 foot coax cable and just made a cable put the
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:14.400]   antenna in an actual window facing the the compass direction of the broadcast tower it's ended upstairs
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:21.200]   upstairs level and then ran the cable down to make it work before that I was not a happy camper because
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:26.480]   I'd gone from when they did the digital switch over I went from getting maybe 12 broadcast channels
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:31.520]   to getting to and I've already established that the only channels that I need are Fox and CBS and
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:36.960]   those are the two of the channels that do not work so I can get the tonight show which I can't stand
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:41.360]   whatsoever but I couldn't get Letterman which again did not make me happy about
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:47.280]   the digital switch over my pick of the week is something I discovered by the way thank you for
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:55.280]   your three two one block pick several weeks ago I now have my own yep and I like it and somebody in
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:00.800]   the chat room says there's a name for this ti and stuff it's was a titanium nitride or something
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:07.040]   there's there's a name for it the coding on this thing but I like it it said you're one to twin
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:17.120]   powers click activate let yesterday of a fractured skull we did a whole episode of iOS today on
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:25.120]   programming apps yes for iOS and there's some really good ones go ahead Renee obviously you this
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:32.560]   this clicked with you oh no I mean they're just like from pythonista to editorial rumors of X code
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.920]   perhaps coming at some point for iOS it's just a fantastic area I wouldn't want to be a serious
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:43.200]   programmer using an iPad but for education for kids and for adults it's great and I found a program
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:50.960]   that actually I I can't wait to spend more time with myself it's called SWIFTI it's free within
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:58.080]   app purchases if for $2.99 you can get all 14 chapters it is an introduction to SWIFT it's
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:04.720]   essentially a interactive introduction to SWIFT that is really really well done so if you've been
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:11.200]   curious about apples new programming language and you kind of want to learn how to do it this is
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:17.440]   kind of like a book 200 tutorials that takes you from the very beginning you know variables and
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:27.360]   control structures to closures and to some serious stuff and I am totally impressed by this so
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:35.360]   it's a it's on iOS for the iPhone or it's a universal or the iPad and I'll show you how kind
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:41.840]   of how it works I'm at the very beginning of it let's let's do some oh you can't I have to put it
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:48.480]   right here okay so it says with code we can also do math so var var 1 equals 18 so we're
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:56.000]   I'm at the very beginning slowly we're gonna var result 1 2 okay so let's do some math let's add
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.720]   so it's a see it's a pop-up I'm gonna add those together I think that's the code we're going for
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:06.320]   and now I'm gonna run it and it's gonna nice print the result and show me and then some a little
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:11.360]   more text and I can go on I can do some more change the value of variables at any time we know the
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:15.600]   value of it's good ideas you let instead so my name is Swiftie I think we should say
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:23.840]   let because that makes it a constant right let name equals Swiftie and there you go and stuff like
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:30.400]   that so this is really cool free to get this this far anyway and then I think later chapters are
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:36.560]   99 cents but it's two dollars and 99 cents for the whole 14 chapter book I think absolutely
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:41.360]   absolutely well worth it if you've wanted to learn Swift this is you know we talked about
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:45.840]   Tinker and and lightbot and other programs that are kind of for kids and drag and drop and stuff
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:51.280]   like this but this is a little bit more sophisticated this is this is really some pretty cool stuff
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:55.840]   Swiftie a good way to learn a language I'd like to see it for more languages actually
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:02.720]   maybe they'll do the the little schemer in and this format would be pretty awesome
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:10.720]   we're at a time but I think not really there's never there's always more time but why not wrap it up
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:16.720]   here I think we've covered everything Andy and that goes at the Chicago Sun times he also blogs
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:26.080]   at CWOB.com and does a lot of podcasts material on replay.tv as a FM I mean related I thought FM
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:32.160]   relay.fm as a matter of fact we're doing our 50th episode of material we're doing our first live
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:36.400]   episode to celebrate. Oh fun and so if you follow me on Twitter I'll tweet out the link to that
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:42.640]   go to I'm at and not go on Twitter. Oh how cool how cool is that? 8 p.m. Eastern time and of course
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:48.000]   that's today right tonight that's today yeah and of course Renee Richie he does his own
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.960]   many shows at imore.com you can find all of them there including the debug podcast
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:00.480]   and I look forward to that Don Milton interview that's cool thank you Renee thank you all for
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.760]   being here we do Macbreak Weekly every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern it's 1800 UTC
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:14.480]   please stop by and say hi you can watch us on the internet at live.tuit.tv or twit.tv/live
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:20.480]   the reason both pages exist they have different players the main player JW player that we use on
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:26.480]   our website is apparently blocked in some businesses and government buildings I think because it's
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:33.120]   used widely for porn I'm not sure that's my guess so we have the sublime player at live.tuit.tv so
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:38.560]   one of the others should probably work for you there are also great apps on every platform written
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:43.440]   by our wonderful third party developers so just look for the twit app and you can watch live or
