[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   we talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   And Renee Ritchie, I guess, is not here
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560]   because there's new Pokemon in town.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.880]   Lori Gildo, I'm happy to say, is filling in.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.320]   Hi, Lori.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.560]   It's great deputy managing editor over there at iMore.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.080]   Yes, that's me.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.600]   You've assumed the Serenity Caldwell
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.040]   write down everything they say on the analyst call duties.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.000]   That's right.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.160]   I cannot hold a candle to Serenity Caldwell, though.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.240]   She was the expert at that.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200]   I remember times when her and I would just
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.840]   be sharing a hotel room and she would be up at 2 in the morning,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.040]   clickety-click, clickety-click.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.000]   She works hard.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.720]   That's not annoying.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.160]   Hey, where is Renee?
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.960]   Is he really out and about doing Pokemon?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.840]   I hope not.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.720]   It's not Pokemon.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.480]   I'm actually not sure what he's traveling for.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.840]   He said he's going to be gone today and tomorrow.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.480]   But he didn't say why, so.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.120]   It's Pokemon.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.840]   It's Pokemon stuff, yeah.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840]   It's great to have you, Lori.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   That's Andy and Ico from the beautiful WGBH in Boston,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   Boston Public Radio, and in Ico.com.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Hello, Andy Roo.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.040]   Hello, happy fall.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   Is it cold and chilly now?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.120]   And the--
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.040]   We call it crisp.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.600]   It is the season where you'll be walking in downtown
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   and find that people have found it necessary to tie corn
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.720]   stocks around the like poles.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.240]   I love that.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.480]   Because I miss fall.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.400]   That was my favorite season in Rhode Island.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   I just loved it.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.040]   It really is quite lovely.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.000]   Also, the cafe that's around the block for me
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   has switched from its spring and summer menu, which
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.280]   is just lunch and dinner, to its fall and winter menu, which
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.320]   is now lunch and breakfast.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.520]   So it means that I can once again get those wonderful pancakes
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.600]   without having to walk more than a couple of hundred feet.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.920]   Is that because they don't like to work in the dark?
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.520]   No, it's because they have this beautiful patio by the water.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.600]   And so there are a lot of people who
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.160]   will come by for dinner by the water with the rippling
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.240]   waves and they can charge more money for water.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.160]   Whereas in the fall, there are people
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.560]   who just want to be in court just ordering or buying coffee
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.360]   just to stay warm.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   Nobody wants to stay outside.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   Yeah, I don't blame him.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.480]   And from the nation's capital comes Alex Lindsay, Pixelcore.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   Hello.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.440]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   Oh, I like the flannel.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.080]   That's nice.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.200]   He's also dressed for winter.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.800]   You know, it's crisp.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   It was crisp.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   So it was cold.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   I flew in last night and I got up and I was like,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.480]   it's really cold out there.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.960]   So yeah, so I dressed a little warmer.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.920]   Like fall.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   I do.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920]   I love it.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.400]   No, I love it mean, Chris, but I just I get to dress in flannel.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.760]   So Laurie, just out of curiosity, did you guys get an invitation
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.440]   to any Apple events that might be coming up over the next couple
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.600]   of weeks?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   Not yet.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Not yet.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   This is puzzling.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.200]   If an Apple event is going to happen, it's well, the invite will probably come this
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.080]   week, this Friday at the latest.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.360]   But I mean, they may not, they may not do an event.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   It could just be just a press announcement.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.200]   It could be that they're just not ready.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.800]   So they're not even going to do anything at all.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.680]   I mean, we haven't had a fall iPad event in a couple of years.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.240]   The last two, I think, were in March.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.360]   So you know, it might there might not be anything else this fall at all.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   We'll see.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360]   Wow.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.440]   There'll be some people very upset, especially people who want to get their new iPads in
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   Bikes.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440]   Definitely.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.000]   I even promised this was probably foolish.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.200]   I promised somebody my old iPad, my old iPad 10.5 inch iPad pro, assuming that I'd have
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.800]   a new 11 inch iPad pro this year.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   Well, maybe not.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.560]   Maybe we'll find out if they're going to do it, they're going to do it in October.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.920]   And that means we're, you know, tomorrow is two weeks from the end of the month.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   So they better hurry.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.280]   Lately, it's been a two week notice, right?
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   It hasn't been one way.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   They have done one week notice in the past.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.560]   I mean, yeah, it could be as little as one week.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.440]   Especially on an event like this for iPhone, you, I think you kind of expect that it, there's
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   more notice because everyone knows it's coming.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.200]   There's no way Apple wouldn't do an iPhone event, but a fall event that's not an Apple
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.520]   event.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.160]   That could potentially be just a one week notice deal for sure.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160]   Right.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   And it depends on how extensive it is.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.080]   If it's really, I find it hard, the rumors that we have in front of us about the changes
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.320]   to the iPads are big enough that it's harder to imagine them not having some sort of public
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.040]   event that they can live stream so they can walk everybody through what makes this different
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.640]   and why it might be worth $1,000 to people.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   But if there's nothing else really apart from that, there's just a parenthetical.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.040]   Oh, and by the way, speed bumps for the speed bump for the Mac mini and there's a speed bump
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.240]   for the MacBook Pros.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.440]   And it might be the sort of thing where we don't know exactly when the way we find out
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.640]   when the launch date is, is when suddenly an embargo date breaks and 10 people or 20
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.480]   people who have been using iPad Pros for the past 10 days without our knowledge, suddenly
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.000]   actually post their reviews.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I think they should.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.400]   I think if it's a Mac mini, there should be fireworks.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.440]   You'll do it yourself if there's a Mac mini.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   You'll throw the parade.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   Exactly.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.920]   So, not only is there no Apple invitation yet, we're still doing white Starbucks cups.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.480]   So I just want everybody.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.120]   Right.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.400]   When the red cups come out, then you know the holiday season is upon it.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.880]   No, no, I can pinpoint it exactly.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.000]   It is the time of season where there's rose after row of bags of Halloween candy.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.640]   But if you look like on the end cap, there are the peanuts.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.520]   Charles Schrulds themed Christmas, Christmas barrels of popcorn.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.600]   We're not there yet.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.280]   We're almost there though.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.600]   First, you still have at least a week and a half to complain about pumpkin spice.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   Laurie, you're a Halloween fan.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.120]   Oh, such a big Halloween fan.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.760]   It's my favorite time of the year.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.960]   What's your costume this year?
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.920]   I'm going, me and a group of friends of mine are going as the characters from metal
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.240]   ocholips.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.080]   Good choice.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.360]   I don't even know what that is.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.120]   You're going to be one of those trick-or-treaters that I go, "Oh, that is a cute costume.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.960]   What the hell are you?"
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.760]   Metal ocholips.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.280]   Metal ocholips.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:52.200]   It was a cartoon that was based on death metal bands, or one death metal band, but it was
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.480]   really hilarious.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:00.920]   If you know anything about metal music, they actually did a really, really good job of
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.480]   making fun of the genre and stereotyping the kinds of people that would be in bands
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   like that.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.000]   There's even these great little Easter eggs in the background.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.040]   I think the grocery store that they visit is called Berzim, which is Berzim's grocery
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.960]   store, which is the name of a death metal band.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.160]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.440]   Are you the guy with the mustache and the gap tooth, or which one are you?
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.840]   The one with the longer hair with the little fumanche style go to you.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.000]   On the right there.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Yes.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.800]   That should be an interesting costume.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   The black t-shirt's easy, but the fumanche mustache, that'll be a challenge.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.000]   Yeah, I'm just going to cut some of my hair and glue it to my face.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It'll be easy.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It'll match.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.760]   We see it'll match.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.600]   Andrew, do you get trick or treaters in your neck of the woods?
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.800]   This will actually be my first year with trick or treaters because it's kind of, again,
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.280]   kind of a downtown-y area.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.360]   There is sort of like a trick or treat night that should kind of bring people in and buy
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.400]   booze and stuff like that.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.800]   I may or may not be home for it, though, which is a bummer because I enjoy being the person
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:22.960]   who gets the deep, I really, really like, like when people like Lori go for the deep
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:31.200]   catalog reference where everybody's saying, "Oh, look, isn't that an adorable elf?"
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   And I'm the one who said, "Oh, awesome link costume."
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   And the look in these kids' eyes, like finally somebody who knows that TV show or somebody
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.200]   who actually plays video games who understands that this is a...
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   I think you're going to get a bunch of people saying, "Are you Steve Tyler?
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.040]   They're not going to know who the hell you are."
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.640]   So that's the fun of it, isn't it?
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.120]   Actually, the group of people I hang out with all know who metalocolipses, they'll get that
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120]   joke.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   Of course they do.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.360]   And Alex, you're not probably dressing up, but I bet you the kids will be.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Yes.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.320]   Yes, the kids are, I think, Malekai's talking about being V for Vendetta.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   And I was like, "Oh, nice.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   You have the best.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   I'm supposed to borrow."
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.560]   I was like, "You know that's really like something that's used by Anonymous."
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   And he goes, "Yup.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   Oh my God, you're a kid, it's good."
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   And I was like, "There's my son.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560]   There's my son.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   That's my son."
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.400]   So he's going there.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.600]   And then we're doing a little large we know project with Isabella's.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.120]   Here's my, I shouldn't telegraph this, but here's my costume.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.400]   It's all ordered and ready.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.280]   It does involve a fan in the butt.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:53.680]   And unfortunately those hands, you can't hold or touch anything because they're sealed.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.920]   So basically they'll be trapped inside an inflatable Pikachu.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.440]   See, that's, but it's comfortable.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.440]   It's comfortable.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   Don't be sweating.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.240]   Until you're trying to sit down.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.240]   Oh, won't be sweating.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   It's inflated.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.000]   That is, I'm saying, you won't be sweating.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.040]   It's built in air conditioning, yeah.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.960]   I will say that there's one Comic Con like in New England remaining for the season.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.800]   And I might break out a project I've been working on for the past two or three years.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.400]   It is a deep catalog costume.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.440]   It's not diff, it's assembled out of things that are readily, excuse me, that are off
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.080]   the shelf items, but you have to find the exact right off the shelf items.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080]   So it depends.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.800]   Oh, if I, you're not going to go as tin foil man again.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.320]   No, no, no.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.480]   I mean, people, I know that at New York Comic Con a couple of years ago, I went as Bill
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.800]   Cunningham and nobody got it.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   Nobody got it.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   Wow.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.680]   I mean, you'll have to be of a certain age to get it.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.040]   But I think those people who they, if they get it, are going to be very, very pleased.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.960]   But I think I was, I was, I was really aggressive about doing Halloween until I was working
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.600]   at Lucasfilm and ILM when competing with the guys in the model shop were no fun at all.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.480]   Like someone came, it was, it was, someone came as, you know, the Toy Story, you know,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.800]   the little, you know, the, the claw, the claw, you know, that, you know, it, but they came
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.320]   as the entire apparatus.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.920]   And one of them was hanging from the funny, you know, like, funny moving around, you know,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.320]   and, you know, it would be, it was like a lot of that.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.840]   And so you either played really hard or you just didn't play.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.080]   I just came to Scotsman.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   I have a kill.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   So I was like, where are you?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   He was a Scotsman.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   Every year.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   I was just like, yeah.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   Killed.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.960]   Maybe somebody will come as the 2018 iPad Pro design.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.320]   These renders give you some idea.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.840]   Perhaps they were shared on Twitter based on leaks from Ben Gescan.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   This is according to the leak.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.360]   This will be a 5.86 millimeter thick iPad.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.240]   That's, that's hopefully, and hopefully with a flexible screen.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.240]   I'm afraid.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   No kidding.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   That's a lot of Ben.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240]   A lot thinner.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.840]   I mean, you're not going to try to put that in your back pocket.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   Are you?
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   I hope so.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   Well, no, but I keep a lot of stuff in my bag.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.920]   And you know, I, my current one is already thin enough where I worry a little bit about
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.880]   where it's being supported in my backpack because I'm afraid it's going to get pushed
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.480]   up against something getting much thinner would make me more stressed.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.800]   Square, square corners.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.000]   Kind of iPhone four style squared corners on this thing according to the leak.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.160]   I really like that look.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.280]   I hope they do that.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.080]   I, I love that on the, on the four inch phone, but iPhone SE looks the same.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.760]   I love that, that squared corner thing.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.240]   I wish we would go back to it.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   I'm just curious.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.840]   I just don't know how, I can't wait to get my hands on it to see how I adjust to
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.400]   having so little bezel to deal with on a device.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.680]   That's that where, where you really can't just like sort of cradle it in your hand like
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.680]   a phone.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.080]   You really do have to, if you're not, if you don't have it on an easel, you are really
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.560]   gripping it on in some way, shape or form.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.040]   And I know they do a lot of like, there's a lot of algorithms in there to make sure that
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.800]   to tell the difference between the his, this is an incidental touch on the edge of the screen
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200]   versus no, this was a liberal challenge.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:20.280]   And it's a, I, I, I hope that this is a practical choice as opposed to a stylistic choice because
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.960]   I think that there might be some circumstances which you'd like to have a little bit of,
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.000]   of, of out of play space that you can hold things and you can grip things and you can
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   have your case kind of like grab it by the sides.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.760]   I don't think you're alone in that fear, but on the other hand, I think that the, what's
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.440]   driving it is not merely style and fashion, but the fact that people have expectation
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.400]   like customers don't want bizzles anymore.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   I see a business now.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   Oh boy.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.240]   Well, also it's, it's amazing to have a device that's pretty much the same size as the one
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.880]   you have got two or three years ago, but the screen is magically this much bigger.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.360]   So you don't have to get a bigger bag.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.440]   You don't have to adapt that way.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   So that's it.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   That's definitely a win for sure.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.120]   I think, yeah, I think the Apple Watch series four is a perfect example of that.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.200]   It actually doesn't really look much bigger on your wrist, but the screen real estate
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.000]   makes it look enormous to look at.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.640]   And I think the iPad would give that kind of vibe to if it, if it lost all its bezel.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.200]   But I completely agree.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   I, I'm constantly accidentally touching my iPhone tennis with, and just kind of moving
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.360]   it or opening something that I didn't intend to.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.080]   And that's with the ability to grip around the edges of it.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.160]   So an iPad that you would hold with both of your hands, how do you not grip or touch
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.680]   something or trigger something on accident if there's zero bezel.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.920]   You might open an app that just happens to be off the edge or something like that.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.200]   There might be a brisk market for cases that give you a little more to hold on the edge,
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   right?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.680]   A little handle on the side.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.320]   Or I know pop sockets for iPad size pop sockets.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.120]   There you go.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   Yes.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.720]   I don't know yet, based on, anyway, these renders which are based on the leaks is where
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.200]   the face ID camera will be.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.800]   There's obviously no fingerprint reader, no home button.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.440]   I think the rumors that we're hearing is that it will be in the, what you might call
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.680]   the top, not the side, but what you call the top.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:25.400]   But it would be, it would also support landscape, whereas are the iPhone 10 and up.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.840]   You actually have to be holding it upright to use face ID.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.560]   The rumor is that on the iPad, even though it's going to be at the top of portrait, you
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.360]   can still hold the iPad and landscape.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.880]   Oh, so when you say at the top, you mean at the side.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.920]   Who uses an iPad in portrait?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.280]   If this were an iPad, it would be, you know, up there at the top.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   Nobody uses the iPad in portrait mode though, right?
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   Comic books, comic book readers.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   I know it's read magazines.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   It looks so rarely.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   Where's my iPad?
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.880]   What did you guys do with my iPad?
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.920]   Anyway, I just want to, so you're saying it'll be Lori on the short side, one of the short
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.920]   sides.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.920]   On the short side.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   That's the rumor.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   And I'm, I'm saying the rumor.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   And it will work in it.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   All rumor.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.040]   And, and, and then that's the question is, have they figured out a way to get face ID
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   to work.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.040]   Now I have to say, again, these are renders.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.360]   So I don't, I don't understand what they're thinking.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   Oh, here's my iPad.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.240]   I don't understand what they're thinking in terms of where there's camera room for
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   a face ID.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.800]   Wouldn't it be bad if you had a turn around and say, okay, unlock it and then turn it
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   the other way?
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   That would be challenging.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   Yeah, that would be really bad.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.200]   I don't, I don't think they even included if they had to, if you had to do that.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.240]   So this is kind of, I'm, you know, Apple's already solved this, right?
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.800]   Because they're presumably making them maybe not.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.560]   I think they may not.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.840]   Well, I think they're really, I think they're really well-motivated to do that, not, not
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:56.920]   really for style purposes, but really the, the user interface of the, of iOS is moving
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.240]   toward, moving away from having a physical home button.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.040]   So I think just getting that home button off the screen is a really, really big deal
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.280]   for them because it's not just, it's, again, it's not just style, but they're trying to
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.840]   teach a new vocabulary, everything saying that there is no, you do not, the basic instructions
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.960]   are not touch the home button to get to back to the launcher.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.080]   It's swipe up from the bottom or swipe down from a corner.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.280]   So they want to make that consistent and part of that involves getting rid of touch ID.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.920]   So now you have to find another solution for that.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.160]   So I think that there, I think they're super well-motivated to, to do this.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.240]   You know, it's funny, Laurie, that you refer to the larger screen on the series for Apple.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.640]   It's such a good job of concealing the bezels on earlier versions of the Apple watch, but
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.680]   it's not immediately obvious that screen is bigger.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.240]   The only place you really see it is when you enter the passcode and those buttons are
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   so much bigger.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.120]   Well, I mean, the interface itself entirely is bigger.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   It does look bigger.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.240]   For me, just the text itself is larger.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.640]   Did you get the 44?
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.720]   No, the 40.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   Okay.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.120]   So did you move from a 38 to a 40?
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   Correct.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.640]   See, I'm on the 44, which is obviously even bigger.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.600]   Even bigger, yeah.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.800]   It does feel more usable, but again, we didn't see the bezels because the whole thing was
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.680]   just kind of this black blob.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   Right.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.920]   It looked bezel-less even though it wasn't.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920]   Everybody.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   Laurie, did you just invent a really wonderful word bezel-us-be-e-z-e-l-l-us?
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   Bezel-us.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.720]   That's because if not, if not, you should claim credit for that because that is a wonderful
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   word.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   Bezel-less.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   It's bezel-less.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Pan-pending, pan-pending.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   Actually, pan-pending.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.520]   Is that one of the bands in the middle of the list?
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.360]   Metal off the clips.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   Wow.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:52.400]   Another thing that it feels like people have kind of forgotten about is the iPhone XR,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   which is coming out this month too, right?
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.120]   The pre-orders go up on Friday.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.480]   Thursday night, midnight, Friday morning, midnight depending on how you put it.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:10.640]   Apparently, Apple is opening its new London store Friday, October 26th, to coincide with,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   look at this.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.000]   It's very pretty in Covent Garden.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.120]   Have you been to that one?
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.520]   I have not.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.520]   I've been in it a couple of times and you just walk in and you're like, "Holy smokes."
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.200]   And I think this is one of the first ones that I went into.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.560]   Maybe the one in Paris also feels that way, but this one just had this very classic look.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.120]   This was before the one that was in the train state in New York.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.840]   This is where the only connection I have to this is where...
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   The flower girl was selling flowers in my fair ways.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.800]   The only connection I know to this, right?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   Mine was mostly looking for.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   Mine was mostly looking for.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.880]   Mine was desperately looking for an ethernet to lightning.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.960]   Well, same thing, right?
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.120]   So these are the beautiful...
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   Apple service credit for this sort of thing.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.720]   There's so many places around the world where they were public spaces that were in danger
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:13.200]   of being turned into a private business or private building that are being cared for,
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.320]   they're being loved, they're being renovated, and they are still on some level a public space.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.040]   Unless you actually pitch a tent and they have your mail delivered, you're welcome to
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.000]   come into an Apple store no matter who you are.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.240]   I realize that they're looking for great pieces of real estate that will show off everything
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.760]   to their greatest advantage.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.760]   But nonetheless, there are all these spaces that could have been some fufu place where
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.600]   there are people at the door to keep out riffraff like me, but it's still a very beautiful
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.760]   place where people can go.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.280]   So I'm glad that they're doing this sort of stuff.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.920]   Will anybody be buying a iPhone XR?
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.760]   I guess I will just so we can show it.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   I still don't know what to tell people that I really keep...
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.520]   For now I've been telling people that hold off for the 10R because all the stuff, most
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.560]   of the really, really cool stuff that you're going to get with a cheaper device, and my
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.440]   philosophy has always been that if you can get a cheaper model but max out the storage
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.920]   versus getting a better model that has less storage to deal with, I'd much rather have
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   the additional storage, particularly when you have a camera that shoots really good 4K.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.000]   So it's the same CPU.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.320]   You don't get dual cameras as the main camera, but you get one and Apple knows how to leverage
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.360]   that really, really well.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.000]   But it's the same wide camera that you get on the more expensive model.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.880]   You get cheaper materials, but aluminum works just great instead of surgical stainless
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   steel.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:55.560]   You get an LCD display instead of OLED, but Apple made great OLED displays up until the
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.760]   iPhone X.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:05.480]   So I don't think that the 10S is a bad phone, but I really think a lot of people are going
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.560]   to have to think hard about where they want to spend that extra 250 bucks.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.720]   I agree 100%.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.480]   I think this is going to be the iPhone of the years, the 10R.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.640]   This is a picture from Apple's store site.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.080]   By the way, as Lori mentioned, you could pre-order on the 19th of Friday and delivery
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.000]   will be a week later on the 26th.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.200]   The screen is the same size, maybe even actually it's a little bigger than the iPhone 8 Plus
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   in a smaller phone.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.960]   So I think that's pretty spectacular.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   That really delivers.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.760]   Even with the notch, it's a taller screen.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.560]   And those colors?
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.800]   Yeah, they're really selling the LCD.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.120]   Although the colors of the phone themselves are pretty good.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120]   Oh, the colors, yes.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   The colors of the phone.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.840]   Ah, I want the red.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   I want the red.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   That's beautiful.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   You want the yellow?
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.280]   I've always been the kind of person who says I hate the color yellow.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:05.640]   But for some reason, on the iPhone X, you guys have got me saying X now.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   It is banana, isn't it?
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.520]   I think it's a really good color.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.200]   I really like it.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.760]   So the color, Charses, are white, black.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.400]   Who would buy white or black when you could choose kind of a light blue, a yellow that
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.640]   is a yellow submarine yellow?
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.800]   Coral, they call it, which is a kind of, it's not pink.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   It's not red.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.840]   It's a little more orange red.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.520]   And then I love the product red stuff.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.960]   That is a nice vibrant red.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.280]   That would be a beautiful phone.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.560]   And are these glass back?
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.520]   What is the material on this?
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   Do we know?
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.360]   I don't think those are glass black.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.600]   These are metal backs?
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.640]   I believe that's correct.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   Okay.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.200]   So no wireless charging.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   If they're metal.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   No.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.360]   I'm pretty sure that I'm not.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.320]   So you're going to get the banana phone?
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   Are you going to really get the banana phone?
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   Here's pricing.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.520]   Well, frankly, my heart is still breaking for the fact that they got rid of the SE.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   So you know.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.560]   This is a great choice for people who would buy the SE or get an older phone.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.880]   Well, not really though.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.840]   We're not buying those of us who love the SE.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.800]   We don't love it because of the price.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.040]   We love it because of the size.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.360]   And the tenor is actually larger than the ten S.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.600]   So that's actually why I chose the tenor was that sorry, the ten S. When I decided which
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.000]   one I was going to pick was the width of the ten S is more compatible with my size.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.720]   Helpless cords you know, chat rooms saying they are glass backs and they do have wireless
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   charge.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.280]   They are glass backs.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.800]   That's what the chat room is telling me.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.080]   So I'll look at the specs.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   I'll look at the specs.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080]   It is the, it is.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   I'm with Laurie.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   It's like I have to.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.600]   It's like there are things I need to, we're trained to write, which means that we can
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.920]   actually double check and make sure we've got things correct.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.080]   Yeah, I'm putting on the spot.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   I know.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.960]   And it's one of those things where, you know, if you ask me about the ten S or the ten S
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.040]   max, I probably know all the spec details of that.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   Right.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.440]   But because the tenor hasn't come out yet, I haven't like memorized all those details.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   So, so I apologize for that.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.960]   Well, and I'm looking at the spec sheet and I still, it's still not, not obvious.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.680]   It comes, I mean, it comes back that here's a wireless charging is another feature that
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.560]   you don't lose by saving 250 bucks or spending that money on 128 or 256 gigs of storage.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   Right.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.320]   So I think, I think you, I'm really recommending that people go to the Apple store, look at
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.720]   both them side by side or actually, but actually better yet, look at the, the ten R first,
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.520]   spend like a half hour with it and then go to the ten S see if you notice huge differences
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.240]   that you can't live with, can't live without.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.280]   Otherwise, again, I think you're going to, I think you're going to love having an extra
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:58.720]   64 or 128 gigs of storage versus having an OLED screen or an S and a second telephoto lens.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.320]   So the pricing is for a 64 gig model, it's $750.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.000]   And if you go, but you, most people are going, though, the question is really how much is
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   it per month?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.480]   Oh, well, that's true.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.100]   And that's, and by the way, Apple really highlights that $37 and 41 cents a month for
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:23.880]   64 gigs, 3950 or $800 for 128 gigs and 4366 a month or $900 for 256.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.120]   So yeah, it's roughly, well, I don't know, what did I pay?
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.520]   I think it's about a 20 bucks difference per month.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.920]   But it's a significant, no, it's not even 20 bucks.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.480]   Oh, from the other phone.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   I got it.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   From the max phone.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.400]   But yeah, it's somewhere between 15 and $15 and $20 per month difference.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   Yeah, that's a big difference for people.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.920]   And I think this, you make no sacrifices with this phone unless your dead set on dual lenses
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   or OLED.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:04.080]   Let's look at the, yeah, 54, the iPhone XS Max starts at $54 a month.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.360]   So it is, it's a significant difference.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.280]   You don't, you can't get banana.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   You can't get banana.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   You can't get banana.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   Stuck with gold.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   You'll be stuck with gold instead of banana.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   Um, dumb old gold.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.120]   Basically 250 bucks, 250 bucks more.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:26.960]   Um, you know, I think the 10 R is going to be the, the killer of the family, but we'll
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   see.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   Isn't it?
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   I mean, isn't it great?
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.760]   This is not, this is not the sort of thing we kind of associate with, uh, with Apple.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.320]   We might have expected them to say, well, we're going to reserve the iPhone XS Max.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:43.360]   We're going to the 3D 3D face ID camera, the edge to edge display, all these features.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.640]   We're going to reserve that for the $1000 price point, but we're going to continue to make
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.840]   really fine pr- phones at our old price point that will always have them, uh, a modern processor
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.120]   and be able to take advantage of modern features.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.240]   They are, they have, they made it a thousand dollar phone last year, but now they really
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   made it.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   This is now the default phone.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.080]   They were able to get that price down, not as low as what, uh, an iPhone, uh, an iPhone
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.960]   9 hypothetically would have been, but still that's, that's, I'm glad to see Apple being
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.680]   able to say, let's figure out a way to bring these really exclusive features down into
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   the mainstream.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.360]   Well, and, and, but you can also see what, you know, they haven't persuaded us now that
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.920]   an $800 phone is the bargain phone.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.160]   You know, so they've, they've very carefully moved that.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   749 dollars.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Thank you very much.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   749.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.800]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:37.240]   One cheek quote are a Chinese Apple analyst says that, um, sales of the four major Chinese
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.880]   brands were down during golden week, which is a big buying week by 10% year over year.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.240]   And he says that bodes well for the iPhone 10 R. Here's an opportunity.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.160]   Maybe people aren't buying expecting to get to the, the 10 R or it could be a, I don't
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.200]   know, well, trade war issues.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.840]   Um, so that, but that may be a bellwether too, that there's interest in the Chinese market
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   as well.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   Let's take a little break.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.600]   When we come back, there's lots more to talk about.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.120]   Lori Gill is here from I'm more.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.240]   She is deputy managing editor.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:16.200]   And when Renee is out of town, she takes over for him here as well as there.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.120]   You do you not know where he is or do you know where he is, but you're not allowed to
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   say.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.920]   No, I, I am not just saying that.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   I actually don't know.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.440]   I think he's in New York, but I'm pretty sure if Renee's not on the show, he's in New York
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:35.200]   getting briefed on new iPads or maybe the 10 R, but the fact that Renee is not here,
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.280]   always to me, he tells me there's new Apple products in the pipeline.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   I don't know why.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.920]   I like it when he's not here because that means I get to be here.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   Yes.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.120]   Don't tell him, but we like it too.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.720]   You always love having Lori on.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.000]   I'm always trying to send him away on some kind of business.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Go to work.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Go to work.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Won't you?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And he and I goes here as always.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.360]   He doesn't have any to do.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   WGBH Boston and not go.com.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.200]   I prefer to say that my highest priority is my responsibility to the many, many listeners
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   of this show.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.840]   I'm usually here too, Renee.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:14.280]   And Alex Lindsey, the pixel core who's today in Washington, DC on business.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   Yep.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   Unspecified.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.520]   Beautiful view in the background is not just a facade.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.440]   That's the actual backdrop of your, where you're at right now.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:28.920]   It is a facade, but it's a, but it's a, it's a, it's exactly what it looks like.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   But it's right.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.920]   It's nearby.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   You can Alex.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.200]   So yeah, this is, this is the world that Alex lives in.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   He could just simply open a window behind him, but he doesn't like the total contrast
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.880]   and actual capital building.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.440]   Much rather have control over the lighting and the shading.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   Why don't we just take a picture?
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:50.480]   We have, we have done ones where we took the video camera and we stuck it like slightly
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.520]   at a different angle, you know, outside and kind of turned it and, and then put it in
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.400]   the monitor behind it because, you know, the frame of the Swiss mountains were better
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   from there.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.000]   And we didn't want to, the frame behind our thing was just other office buildings.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I agree.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Real mountains.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   What?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.560]   Yeah, we offset it by like four feet.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:15.000]   By the way, speaking of that, Andy, I did go out and get a, a, a, a rora from the, a
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.680]   skylum folks based on your recommendation last week.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.200]   And then went back through all my pictures from my trip and redid them all because you're
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   absolutely right.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   It just is wonderful.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.960]   I just say it's just the coolest thing.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.640]   I'm rehanging without getting into a huge, huge rat hole.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.000]   I got to, I've been rehanging like old family pictures that I took down from last move.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And I'm taking them up.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Oh geez.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.840]   Let, a, that one was, I, I did that in Photoshop circa night, circa circa like 2003 and plus
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.000]   the colors have faded a little bit, even just without having the negative.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.360]   If I just put that picture in a scanner, not, not just fixing the color that it faded,
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.120]   but I cannot do so much better.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.960]   There's a, there's a picture of the, the one time I managed to get the entire extended
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.400]   family together in front of mom and dad's house, like as a huge, huge group.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.520]   And was so concerned about getting everyone positioned right and getting the lighting
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.840]   right, getting the flash right.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.280]   I forgot to ask my dad to close the front door behind him.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.240]   Oh, you can see like, and so I finally like added the, I finally close the front door
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   in Photoshop.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.840]   The one thing that annoys me about that picture, I can't recommend highly enough.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.680]   Every now and then when you get a brand new tool, go back into your old favorite photos
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   and you'll be amazed at how much better your 1999 Sony, your Nikon cool pics camera can
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.080]   be after running it through modern apps.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.200]   I'll give you actually an example if I can go back far enough in time.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   There was a picture I took in Barcelona that I love the composition of, but I just, I
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.760]   it was, it didn't come out as I had seen it, you know, as I was there.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.640]   And, and I went back, let me, let me skim way back here because this was at the beginning.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   Actually, you know what?
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.200]   If I search for Barcelona, I could probably find it faster.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.720]   Google photos, very good in that.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.840]   So I'll show you, I'll show you the original.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.160]   Actually it's this or something like this.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.560]   Yeah, I think that's the original.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.640]   And then I'll show you, so I'm going to run it through Aurora.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   And let's see, let's, let's find that.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.400]   And it just, it saved the picture as far as I'm concerned and made it a very interesting
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   image.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.520]   So let me do that again.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.240]   That's before that's after.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   Oh wow.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.800]   That's not subtle.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.640]   Well, it's a lot of HDR and I think, I mean, I mean, I'm saying the improvement is.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.080]   Well, this was unusable.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.640]   It was just, you know, too dark to really, to really use it.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.320]   I was one of these and, you know, it's my fault for not a great exposure, but it was
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.240]   also, you know, it was a difficult day.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:50.160]   You see the light in the background was really, was really fooling it and didn't fool Aurora.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.880]   I like the grain it added in the clouds too, actually.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.040]   I love the, you got, we got streams of heavenly light bursting in.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.000]   That's very, they were there, but you just could barely see them.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   That's all.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.840]   It's so, it's so liberating in photography when you realize that your job is not to present
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.120]   an image as it was when you took the picture.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.800]   Your job, your most, your greatest value is when you present something the way that you
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   remember it.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   It looked.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   Yes.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   And so I was very happy.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   But emotional.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.640]   Yeah, to get, to get, to recover my pictures basically.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.320]   So thank you for a, for a great recommendation.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.720]   They, we're going to get Scott Born, who is now on their board.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.120]   He's a long time member of the Macbreak family.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.920]   He's now on their advisory board and of course he's a great photographer and he's done some
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   wonderful things.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.120]   We're getting him in in December.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.440]   I'm seeing him next week.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.640]   Not sure why he'll be here in December, but there'll be a reason I'm sure.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.560]   So that's, yeah, we'll be talking more, more about that.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.200]   I'm really, really a fan of their stuff.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.440]   Hey, let's take a little break.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.720]   Come back with more of our guests also.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.560]   I mentioned all three of you.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.560]   All of you.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.560]   You're great.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.080]   Our show day brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.800]   If you're doing some hiring, you know, and if you're in the small business like ours or
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.040]   if you're a sole proprietor, hiring is a big deal because it's, it's like you're out,
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   you're down a person.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.760]   It's like a hockey team with a couple of people in the penalty box.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.640]   You're down a few people and you're busy.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.680]   You're doing a lot more because of it and still you have to find a replacement.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.320]   That happened to us actually a few months ago.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.400]   Our bookkeeper announced she was leaving.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.240]   She gave us a couple of weeks notice and then Lisa is going, is frantic because that
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.160]   means she's going to have to pick up this lack and do all the bookkeeping and she's got
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.040]   to find a replacement and it was at breakfast for sitting over the table.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.080]   I said, well, this is a perfect time to try Zip Recruiter.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.640]   Zip Recruiter is fantastic because A, it posts your job listing everywhere to about more
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.560]   than 100 job sites with just one click at the mouse.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.480]   And the beauty of that is you're going to reach out to as many people as possible.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.640]   But B, they do something remarkable.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:37:00.920]   They actually find people for you and invite them to apply for your job.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:06.680]   They're using some powerful matching technology to scan all the resumes they have on file,
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.560]   which is many hundreds of thousands identifies the people with the right skills, education,
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.800]   experience and then invites them to apply, which means you get qualified candidates fast.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.920]   We talked about it at breakfast.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.880]   Lisa put it up on Zip Recruiter before lunch.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.360]   We had three candidates and as each one came in from Zip Recruiter, she said, wow, this
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   is good.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.760]   Oh, wow, this is really good.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.520]   Wow, this person's perfect.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.600]   It was really remarkable.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.280]   Even a few hours that is you don't have to wait for the right candidate to apply to your
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   job.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.920]   Zip Recruiter is smart.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.640]   Go to ziprecruiter.com/macbreak to hire the right person.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.920]   Of course, all those resumes, all those applicants, they don't call you.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   They don't send you email.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.800]   It all goes into the Zip Recruiter interface.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.160]   They reformat the resumes so they're easy and fast to read.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.720]   You can have questions to screen out people who don't fit.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.920]   You can rank them real fast.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.080]   You can eliminate people you don't want and find the right person fast.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.600]   It's number one among employers in the United States, according to Trustpilot, over a thousand
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.600]   reviews.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.840]   Number one, really impressive stuff.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.040]   Right now you can do it for free.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.600]   So why not?
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   Try it for free at ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.000]   If you use that address, they know you heard it here and we like that.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.360]   Ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   We hired a great bookkeeper fast and we thank Zip Recruiter not only for that but also for
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   their support.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   Ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.280]   You had a very happy ending.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:48.360]   Phil Schiller speaking of photography was a surprise visitor at Adobe Max yesterday.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:55.640]   And lo and behold, what did you preview?
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   Schiller said it's not watered down.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.200]   It is Photoshop.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   With all the assets and tools, you need to create the same projects you can do on the
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.680]   desktop but you're doing it on the iPad.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   I'm curious about that.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   I saw the announcement.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.680]   Part of me is like really everything?
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:20.280]   To be fair, doesn't Affinity Photo do much of what Photoshop does?
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.800]   It does but I think that what has me go back to Photoshop is that it's always missing
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.200]   little details that you use in Photoshop that are very obscure.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.720]   Certain selection tools or channel operations that I think are there.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:38.800]   I think Affinity Photos and I use Affinity Photos specifically for 360 editing.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.120]   You can put it into a 3D space and rotate it up and paint out your tripod if you're taking
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.800]   360 photos or video.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.040]   So it's the best thing for that.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.200]   So I use Affinity Photo but I don't find myself.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.960]   I have the same problem with Pixelmator is that I've been using Photoshop since 1991.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:05.720]   So it's really hard for me to transition to the new apps which are now not that new.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.000]   But I look at it when they say that it's everything.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.120]   I'm just like I just have a hard time believing that everything went in.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.280]   I feel like there's a little marketing there.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.360]   I think you're right because they don't say feature complete.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.600]   They specifically don't say feature complete.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.360]   So they say everything you need and I'm like okay.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.240]   I'm sure that it's going to be great and I think that for folks like me that want to
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.800]   do stuff in Photoshop but still want to do it on our iPad but can't quite.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.400]   I think that there is a big market for it and I think it's a great idea for Adobe.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.800]   I just think that when they say it's the full version I was like maybe.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.400]   I think maybe they mean full file compatibility including layers including macros including
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.240]   that sort of stuff.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.840]   You realize that when they make promises to the Photoshop community these are people
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.400]   who are making lots of money with Photoshop.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.840]   These are just like people like me who occasionally want to take a leaf off of someone's
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   face.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.440]   So if they make promises they can't deliver oh my god they'll be so horrible.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:12.160]   Well the big deal is just the ability to take a project you've been working on on the desktop
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.760]   take it with you on the iPad or get started with something on the train home from a photo
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.400]   shoot or whatever and then not have to import it.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.720]   Not have to even as you say to kind of translate the skills you've been developing in Photoshop
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.000]   for the past 10 years and say what does it mean in Procreate to have a layer or how does
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.400]   this brush tool work in Procreate.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.920]   There were other announcements that Mac users or an iPad users will be interested in Adobe
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   Macs.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   They did release Premiere Rush, Creative Cloud Video Editor, a much simplified version
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:51.440]   of Premiere which does run on the iPad but Rush is intended to be completely cross platform
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:59.960]   on iOS, on Android and even on Chrome OS as a Chrome plugin.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.400]   And so that's very intriguing.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:11.880]   I mean you wouldn't abandon Premiere but Rush is you know Premiere compatible and more powerful
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:17.160]   than Premiere clip or Premiere elements so according to Adobe so that's interesting.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.600]   I immediately installed on my iPad.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.560]   I've been playing with it a little bit on Chrome OS and I thought that was pretty impressive.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.760]   Premiere Rush is $9.99 a month unless you have an all apps plan.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.640]   And I don't, everyone was really including myself was kind of concerned when they went
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.360]   from a buy at an own it model to a subscription only model but I got to say that they really
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.800]   have delivered.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.040]   They continue to add features that maybe I wouldn't have been willing to spend an extra
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:52.800]   $50 for an extra $80 or $90 for their mobile arm of this of the Creative Suite is just
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:43:00.080]   gobsmackingly good for you consider how well Adobe Lightroom works on a Chromebook essentially
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.040]   on a web browser.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.560]   And yes they're taking kind of the easy way around it because they're not making a real
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.960]   Mac native app.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:13.480]   It is the Adobe Photoshop interface that's been translated here and there but for once
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:19.680]   for one manageable fee per month to get access to the entire this entire library of apps
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.800]   and also all of these great little features that keep popping up.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.320]   Anytime I want to do something really fancy in Photoshop it's I kind of have to train
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:33.560]   myself to do a web search on I want to I want to make someone who's looking to the left
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.120]   look like they're looking upwards and fine and as before I'm about to do two hours for
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.280]   the work find out that oh well there was a there's there's a new feature that pushed
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.680]   out three weeks ago that's all about eyeball.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.000]   Eyeball adjustment just highlight the eyes and pull them to where you want this person
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.880]   to be looking at and you're gone.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.480]   That's not an actual feature but that's I'm sure that's something they're working on
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.000]   but that's what I'm that's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.440]   They keep they keep justifying the amount of money I give them by keeping giving me features
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.320]   that make really barbariously difficult things really easy.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:10.240]   I am however anxious to see what Skylum does with their their damn their digital asset
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.000]   management because Luminar which is awfully good and we were just talking about Aurora
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   and if they do if they do it something that can right now you know what at least it does
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   she uses Luminar and Aurora and she just uses Apple photos as her asset management
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.840]   tool keeping track of everything it exports fluidly and it really works quite well so
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.840]   it's not a bad choice.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.720]   Lightroom is being updated somewhat Apple photos migration tool if you want to move
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:43.280]   out of photos into Lightroom a new sense a powered people view improved search and new
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:49.680]   sharing options and then the Adobe's a design tool XD which I don't use so I'm not familiar
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:56.080]   with that's fairly new and they're going to add voice capabilities this fall to XD.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:05.880]   I don't even apparently you can use Amazon Echo with the interface you know zoom in enhance
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.800]   I don't know I don't know what the commands will be Photoshop for iPad and something called
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:18.360]   project Gemini which is a complimentary to Photoshop that'll be coming in 2019 the early
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.120]   stage project according to nine and five Mac aims to offer consistent drawing and painting
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:31.840]   surface across experience across all surfaces so no matter what you're using product product
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:39.400]   project Gemini Gemini the twins sounds like they want to somehow I don't know twin their
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   applications in all on all platforms closed pre-release and iOS is available now for professional
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:54.960]   in illustrators so a lot of announcements at the event.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.120]   The most fun part of that show is always when they just do this magic show where they say
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.640]   here I love that we're working on we don't we don't have any timetable for releasing these
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:09.080]   but here is that it's it's going to be something that I think that's when they introduce the
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:15.000]   content to where Phil the the abilities just to simply say here is here is my brother in
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.160]   law who my my sister fortunately just divorced and I want him gone from this picture from
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.200]   the family cookout and you circle the brother in law and you say content to where Phil and
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:30.440]   suddenly either it's it's Nick it's almost matchless or it's basically takes five seconds
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.040]   worth of tweaking to finish it up and that's the sort of stuff they show off things they
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.080]   don't have they they have enough for a really great demo but not enough for a release yet
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:43.000]   and your it's it's that it's usually at that that that wonderful intersection between really
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.320]   really cool really really useful and really really creepy.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:55.880]   The Gemini will be interesting because it's iPad first so you know their focus so and
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.960]   I guess it's a drawing app they say design is simplified drawing and painting workflows
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:06.440]   with a simple cross device support combining the raster imaging of Photoshop with a vector
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:13.560]   imaging of Adobe Illustrator and dynamic brushes into a single experience ideal for
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.520]   drawing and content.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.280]   That's an ambitious project.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.200]   Wouldn't it be wonderful if one of the things they're working on either for this app or
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:30.640]   for just Photoshop in general is to is to have sort of extend continuity to Photoshop between
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:37.000]   an iPad Pro and a Mac book or any other desktop map to say oh I see that you're actually
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.880]   you're actually two feet away from a Mac that's also running Photoshop would you like to use
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:47.960]   this beautiful $99 Apple pencil in this beautiful $900 iPad as a graphics tablet so you can
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.440]   edit directly so you'll be running Photoshop on the Mac but you'll be essentially using
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.400]   this as a whack-up tablet boy would that be an exciting move for people who like me who
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.800]   have both.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.480]   I know I mean most of the designers that I know now that are really serious about are
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:08.420]   using their 13 inch you know iPad you know to iPad Pro as they're basically as the whack
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.680]  -up tablet you know connecting it via lightning you know to the computer and the latency is
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.600]   low enough that they have been interested so people aren't buying whack-up tablets anymore
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.560]   they just use iPads yeah wow yeah it's they they definitely like the performance better
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:27.400]   than the than the whack-up tablet so so it's you know most people that I know have have
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.880]   kind of switched over to that process you know they they find the performance of the
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   and I think the pencil works better than than the I have a whack-up tablet right in front
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.120]   of me for something else and so I use the whack-up tablet a lot or even a couple of
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:46.960]   them at a time and so I you know but I use them because I can mechanically drive the
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.040]   HDMI input like it's not the performance on the iPad now is pretty good I found that
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.800]   those to be a little wonky you know the I never get the kind of performance on my iPad
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.160]   but I think that if you tune the system and you do a little tweaking you can get it to
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.040]   to work well and I definitely know a lot of designers that have been using their iPad
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:09.960]   13 Pro to as the as the other screen you know for for their for their for their Mac.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:16.240]   People apologizing a small number of user accounts in China have been hacked via phishing
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:21.080]   attacks Apple said we are deeply apologetic about the inconvenience caused to our customers
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:27.560]   by these phishing scams however two factor authentication might have prevented these
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:33.080]   attacks from taking place at all if you had an alley pay account linked to the iCloud
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:39.600]   account funds were drained from the alley pay through fraudulent app store purchases and
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:48.440]   subscriptions and they notify you at unusual times of day so you wouldn't notice some users
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:55.040]   said they lost hundreds of dollars through this hack.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.240]   I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that Apple's moved its iCloud storage
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.520]   to China probably not right.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:08.280]   Yeah I think that was just unfortunate just a I mean hackers are hackers it's it's they're
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:14.720]   going to they're going to attack wherever they can and is it Ali is like the Ali pay
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:23.880]   is like the most the largest I can't even remember what the what their it's especially
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:29.840]   with Alibaba but I wonder you know the other one is we chat so I don't know if I don't
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:39.040]   know if it related to we chat or not anyway just just a just a point of interest.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.520]   Apple is apparently patenting some technology that is similar to technology Google announced
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.600]   in its pixel three phones and that will be coming I think to a lot of Oreo users a way
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:54.920]   to fend off spam call or just becoming more and more of a problem one analyst said that
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:51:01.040]   by next year half of all cell phone calls will be robo calls and spam calls apple has
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.760]   a patent that would automatically recognize a fake call and warn you accordingly Google
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:12.000]   apparently does this and has a button on the pixel three that says send that call to you
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.960]   know to voicemail or ask that caller to identify themselves before I pick up which would be
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.640]   very handy and that is on phone that is not done on network.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.000]   Yeah I think a lot of the stuff is going to start closing up I mean you know that has
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.120]   to it's become such a pain hasn't it.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:33.240]   Well the problem is is that they got so good at it you know the the issue is is that you
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.600]   know when you ignore all those spam calls it actually it's better for the system because
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.560]   you have a computer that's just basically casting across many many many different phones
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.200]   at the same time and it's just reaching out with IP connections what what connections it's
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:52.120]   going out and you know only coming back to a human when someone picks up the actual phone
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   so whether you ignore it or not actually makes it easier for them to figure out who
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.680]   might actually be someone that's interested in talking for a little while.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.920]   And so the system has gotten so efficient that it just it just makes sense it's like
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   a Nigerian scam I mean you just calling off people or you you get across enough people
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.600]   you're going to end up with someone to pull on.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.720]   I wish they would learn that I don't pick up and stop calling me.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:18.680]   You know the best way to do it is when I when I used to be a freelancer a lot of times I
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:25.880]   you know I would have a lot of fun with folks when I had back when I had time and but I used
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.640]   to my right my thing was also see how long I could keep a spammer on the phone because
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:34.360]   that's really what makes the system inefficient is when you stay on so my record is 37 minutes
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.360]   oh man.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.160]   And the key is when you get the call and you go hey how's it going and you go oh that
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.320]   sounds that sounds really good I mean I think I might need one of these oh wait wait wait
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:50.800]   just second I got another call and then you come back sorry sorry man oh yeah and you
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.040]   get them all excited again and then you start listening you're like yeah yeah I'm sorry
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.440]   I got another call and then you and then you jump off again and you just see how long
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.880]   you can do it and for a long time I could only get 15 or 20 minutes out of people but
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.440]   then after a while you get good at it.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.960]   Sorry man I got I got I got I got lousy credit.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.080]   Could I give you like a bank wire transfer like I give you like my routing number.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.560]   No no he is it's got to be an easy great sale the key to doing this is it's an easy
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.040]   great sale you've got perfect credit you you can't wait to do it and you just keep on
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.360]   having people call you and you have to and you put them on call waiting for just a second
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.640]   then you put them on hold you put the phone down for a while and you go back to work and
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:33.360]   then you can pick it up again and I have to I got to say I hate telemarkers and verbal
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.880]   callers with a passion however you know that you know that the when you're talking to that
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:44.200]   real life person you're talking to Willie Lohlin it's hard for me to feel good about
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.120]   the same it's somewhat much rather it's much rather just like not into the phone but
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:57.760]   but it shows you normally my my response partly is to this is that why do we why don't
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:03.280]   we have laws that the that the carriers have to follow in order to stop these things from
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.320]   happening but I don't know what kind of law we can put into place that they could actually
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.320]   enforce it's it's it's so difficult so we're gonna we're gonna need better technology I
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:18.080]   love the the Google's approach which is first on the pixel as going to be going out pixel
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.720]   three and they're gonna roll it out to other models of pixel phones and maybe just to
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:28.240]   Android in general is just simply it's brilliant where it's not just it lets you do call screening
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.600]   by doing a voice to text it will just fill the little alert with not just here's the
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.720]   phone number that's calling but here's what they're saying right now so you can just
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.480]   figure out that okay if it says if it is my aunt I'm definitely picking up the phone
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:48.920]   but it's it's it's it's amazing how much power people have to ruin anything that that I would
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:55.600]   I gave someone my my soul number and as usual I have to I have to add it by just just send
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:01.240]   me a text because I almost never actually answer the phone yeah for so many reasons yeah
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:08.560]   yeah and my so and my phone is set to do not deserve if it's outside of my unless I'm expecting
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:14.120]   something is generally do not disturb it's not in my phone in my phone book and in my contact
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.840]   list and then I what it does make you do is if you have a new client or a new partner
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.480]   or or someone that you have to talk to you very quickly put their phone number into your
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.160]   yes your phone do your car I can't reach you because it just kind of whitelist it because
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:32.080]   I might my email is the same way where I I everything that isn't something I know or I
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.200]   haven't responded to in the past goes into a folder that I sometimes get to my problem
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:42.120]   is my doctor uses call blocking so it's always an unknown caller and of course I will never
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.560]   answer the phone for an unknown caller yeah yeah but at least he leaves messages I don't
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   really probably just real quickly point out there is the national do not call registered
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:59.120]   which does not work have you done it it actually I did it with lamline phones I haven't tried
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.720]   doing it with it with a cell phone yet but it counts your your mobile phone does count
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.600]   so if you do receive phone calls from live people I've done it I've done it are allowed
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:14.240]   to tell them you know I'm on the do not call registry so stop calling me but but here's
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:18.240]   the point is these people are not in the United States and so they just it with impunity
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   ignore the law I'm on I've been on the do not call list for all my phones since 2015 does
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.440]   it feel like it's getting more intense I mean I absolutely getting 10 or 12 calls a day
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.600]   yeah that are that I just look down at them now so I'm trying something called no more
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:44.240]   robo I don't know if you guys have tried this it is a dollar 99 per line and it it's a little
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.120]   concerning because you have to give it kind of access to your contact list and stuff but
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:53.520]   I they say we don't take it off your phone and it does it does block robo calls I have
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.800]   it right now my iPhone and I haven't gotten a robo calls as I put it on there on the weekend
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:04.000]   over the weekend so a lot of people swear by this you can get it free for landlines and
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.800]   if you want it on mobile it's a dollar 99 month per device and it does seem to work I
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:14.520]   was scared off by the reviews on the app store but but I think that it actually seems to
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:22.320]   work pretty well I just like to use this as an excuse for cover my my timidity at having
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.120]   to suddenly have an interaction with somebody that I was not preparing for yeah I don't
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:31.280]   answer the phone at all ever if it's not my life I don't answer it I'm a person who has
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:37.080]   to rehearse saying hello hello hello hello I think my you know what and the worst part
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:40.880]   is my message even says I was like don't even leave a message I know your message is great
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:46.200]   yeah I don't talk on the phone I love it I love it I was like you just send me a text
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.400]   or you just send me an email if you don't have email you should get it yeah you haven't
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:54.520]   changed that in a while no I haven't it's it's classic I've actually re-recorded it a
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.480]   couple times when I get new phones or something go I go between services because it's just
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   I am really not interested I'm not interested in picking up voicemail I can't read the last
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:07.360]   time I've gotten I've actually listened to voicemail as Patterson I'm sorry the chat
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:15.120]   was said I don't do no I you text me or you know I just don't care you know like if you
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:20.360]   know it's like if I if my mom calls I pick up I if I saw that she called I call her back
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.960]   but I don't care what she left on the message because I'll just talk to you know so I probably
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.920]   not worth listening to because she's going to tell you when you talk to her anyway right
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.760]   exactly like I'd rather just have a real conversation than listen then listen to someone
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.000]   talking then there because I have there's lots of rules you know to to leave your messages
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.360]   because I leave messages every once in a while you have to say your name then you say the
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.960]   phone number and you leave the message then you say the phone number again and if you
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   follow that it's much easier for people I always do because then yeah but a lot of people
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.360]   don't they'll give you this long droning voicemail and they leave the message at the end and
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.760]   if you don't get the phone number all at the very end then you have to listen to the whole
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:59:01.560]   thing again there to get back to it you're like oh do you think helpless cordes in our
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:06.200]   cherram says I have a feeling robocalls are going away naturally once an older generation
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:10.740]   of non-techno literates are gone do you I mean the reason these are in on the upswing is
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.960]   because they're cheap to do technologies made it virtually free just like spam virtually
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:20.280]   free to do it and they're using VoIP so it's really easy for them to do millions of calls
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:27.400]   a day but they but ultimately it has to succeed and do you think that there that at some point
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:33.720]   it'll just so be so worthless that people just stop doing it I think there's a lot of
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:40.040]   things I think abrogate you know I mean it you know the you know the idea of interrupting
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:44.520]   I think it's something that will slowly I mean it might take us 20 years but but I think
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.480]   it will slowly filter a lot of that stuff out I mean my kids you know when they see
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:55.040]   when they see ads on TV they're perplexed and upset and you know like what is this I don't
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.000]   understand like you know you too but keep on inter but you don't have ads on your YouTube
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.640]   because you pay for YouTube red is that why they they just don't watch anything they literally
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.960]   if I can't skip over it they'll never go back to that video again wow you know like it's
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.240]   you know it's just like they're not they're not interested and they'll see ads and you'll
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.640]   seem to immediately skip away to something else like if they don't see the five second
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.160]   countdown they just go to the next thing you know like they're not going to watch 30
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.200]   seconds of anything for for a video you know and so they're you know they're it's it's
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.280]   fun to watch eight or you know nine ten year olds interact with media because they're so
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:35.920]   efficient the modern the modern world is making us anti-social isn't it I think so I mean
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.440]   or more globally social though yeah but that's not real social that's that's pseudo social
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.720]   that's Facebook social I think the problem is is that social media in its current the
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.200]   current version of social media I would say is kind of empty calories so we keep eating
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.600]   and we don't get full you know like it's just like you just keep eating and you don't get
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.200]   full and right by full I would say feeling related to anyone right you know so you think
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.280]   that you're being connected to your relationship it's all it's all kind of like it's just it's
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.800]   all like Krispy Kreme's you're just eating a lot of Krispy Kreme in most days so I think
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   so I think that's that's that's the chance maybe we're doing it wrong Laurie and Andy
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.920]   disagree maybe we're doing it I think I think Laurie's right it's like yeah so I do I do
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.400]   I do agree that it's not the best version of being social but I think that you know for
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:26.000]   example I just got to spend a couple of days with my first cousin once removed we had to
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.880]   we had to figure that out and I'd only ever seen her once in my entire life before that
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.760]   but we've stayed connected through social media and that allowed me to have a relationship
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   with the with someone that I'm related to but who lives on the other side of the country
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:45.560]   so that's what I mean by globally is that I think I agree that we've we box ourselves
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.600]   out of the world world that's right in front of us our friends that live next door are
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.240]   down the street but we're also opening ourselves to be more social with people outside of our
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.640]   immediate sphere so and I agree I agree to that I mean I think that when we have conversation
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:04.920]   I think conversation is the important right I have I have a couple uncles and they range
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.160]   from very very liberal to very very conservative and one of our past times is you know we have
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:16.600]   a group messenger thing where we sit there and talk about politics and and yeah I only
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.720]   see those uncles maybe once every couple years in person but I see them every day you know
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.080]   on you know in a kind of an ongoing conversation and it's in kind of an enjoyable little thing
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.000]   to do and and I so I definitely agree with you that there are ways that we're using media
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.200]   to be social but I think that when we think about looking at people's posts or their tweets
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.760]   or their you know other things like that I think that is where it gets dangerous where
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.640]   it becomes a again just a lot of empty calories people spend hours I have to admit I got I
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.000]   didn't drop Facebook I'm I'm still on Facebook I check it on my computer and everything else
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.440]   by turning off my phone and oh my and I think I talked about a couple weeks ago it was just
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.240]   suddenly got I don't know I feel like I got a lot of my my time back and my sanity back
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.640]   and my battery back and I just didn't so just taking off the phone it was all I needed so
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.440]   so long as you understand the transaction as long as you understand the effects of the
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.920]   the of the narcotic that you're you're engaging in I think I think it's a pretty good trade
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:17.120]   off I mean I would not describe my social ineptitude as a disability however I have
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.520]   often thought of some of this technology that have around me as if I if it were a disability
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:28.440]   it would be like an assistive device the ability to have a social interaction with somebody
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.640]   without feeling as though the nervousness I get when I meet someone for the first time
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.360]   I could have like a micro transaction that I'm very very comfortable with and then so
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.320]   many times after having these micro transactions over social media I have made a whole bunch
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.240]   of friends that are welcome to stay at my house who we got to dinner whenever we're
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.400]   whenever we're in each other's towns and I would not necessarily have been the people
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.240]   who are my neighbors sometimes I don't know whether to say hey what I'm gonna be staying
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.360]   up watching the Oscars and I'll be making a couple pieces once you come over because
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.640]   okay now have I obligated them to come over and they don't want to but they feel and
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.800]   now and will I be obligated to come over to their house and all this other stuff so it's
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.480]   so long as you understand the transaction that's that's happening and like Lori said
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:23.280]   it's there's so many people that I would not have met otherwise that that are now just
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.680]   again really good friends of mine the flip side of that though is that there are there
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:32.240]   are times where like if there's like someone with like a half a million Twitter followers
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:42.320]   and I am by him and this is somebody who is very very share e regarding all of we're
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.200]   regarding personal details of their life so I know what their wife's name is I know what
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.720]   their kids look like I know that one of the kids has a disability I know that you know
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:55.560]   you're sort of by watching that by having this the sort of little observations into your
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:01.120]   life I think it does plug into the hundred thousand year old social software that's wired
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.520]   into your brain about if I know these if I know these details about these people on a
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:12.800]   regular basis I must know these people personally and I don't overstate this but sometimes I
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.400]   can feel myself about to like respond oh that's too bad what are you gonna do but oh wait
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.880]   no this is it's not it's not necessary for me to show concern it's not necessary for me
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.120]   to become involved because I don't know this person this person doesn't know me and I'm
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.840]   about to do I'm about to react respond to this in such a way that this person is at least
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.040]   a casual acquaintance and they're totally not so this one again as long as you understand
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.720]   the properties of the narcotic you go okay yeah I think it's I I'm glad I'm I mean I
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.560]   have the best the reason the reason I had to take it off the phone is I literally think
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.560]   I have the best Facebook feed ever you know like I have it's wildly diverse that's what
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:56.280]   they want you to think Alex no I've got almost 5,000 friends I'm almost to the limit and
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.600]   I have I have I didn't do it the way you're supposed to do it you know you're supposed
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.440]   to friends or friends or all that BS I just went I friended you know like if you have a
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:11.680]   big camera or a or a dead cat you know on your on your dead cat is a mic it's a mic
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:16.800]   the feed not it's not really a dead cat I friended people with dead cats and I thought
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:23.080]   that was good yeah yeah no or a or a or a steady camera jib I'm gonna friend you you
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:27.440]   know and if and if you if you and I don't friends you can try to get anything I just
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.520]   know you're gonna post things that I'm interested in and you're gonna post behind the scenes
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:35.240]   of shows and everything else and then if you're from Zimbabwe I'll probably post you or most
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.920]   of Africa Zimbabwe Rwanda Kenya I'll friend you as well and once once you start friending
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.880]   people what happens is it's like this spiraling process where you suddenly are friending lots
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.360]   of people and and so I've got hunt like when when the Zimbabwe elections happened over
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.320]   the last over the summer you know I have 400 friends in Zimbabwe and so you got to watch
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.360]   all these people that were Zano P F and MDC and they're all arguing and and it was it was
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.880]   fun you know and so and so I I think that for me it was addictive because I actually
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:04.800]   felt like I tuned by I tuned my my process and I'm also very careful about what I click
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   on you know like I don't I don't like everything you know I'm very careful because I know that
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.520]   it whatever I do if I sit there and watch it or if I click on it or even slow down a little
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.640]   bit it's gonna it's gonna change with the I'm gonna get lots of those posts you know I'm
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:22.200]   gonna get more of whatever I was clicking on so I what I I'm very conscious to when I
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:28.280]   click on something that I'm telling Facebook I would like to see more of this you know and
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.560]   and so when we again like you said Andy when you have it when you're a very conscious
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:37.720]   relationship with your with your social media you it's fun I just realized that my addiction
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.480]   was too much that you know I maybe I shouldn't have it in my hand all the time.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:49.920]   I shouldn't have it shouldn't have the the phone having all those things available.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.000]   So you're making me want to create a new Facebook account then I realized that no I've heard
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.600]   this shimmeels before.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600]   Great.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.320]   I've heard this feel from everybody with a Facebook account and you're just doing it
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.720]   wrong Leo if you just did what I do you'd love your Facebook account or Twitter account
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.720]   or Instagram account.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.720]   No it's all trash.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.720]   That's what I think.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:18.080]   There's also something to consider though just not to get off on the same subject of social
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.640]   media for so long but the younger generations of people none of us know what that's like
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.400]   and these are these are teens and young people who have been born and raised with social
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.480]   media.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.040]   It means something completely different.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040]   Well that's true.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.280]   Yeah I admit I'm an old guy.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.760]   Such a good point.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.760]   My kids only chat with each other like they don't I don't see them posting stuff it's just
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.000]   like these constant conversations with friends on mostly Roblox.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.800]   You know it's like that's like they're a little process of them talking back and forth but
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.080]   they seem to be chatter I don't see them that maybe they don't have a lot of accounts
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.480]   yet so I mean that's it but they don't seem to post a lot of stuff.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.960]   So you don't do you discourage them or encourage them do you think that this that social is
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   their future?
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.720]   Yeah I mean I think that you do have to make sure that they're doing other things my kids
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.400]   are pretty active so they're they're doing a lot of different stuff but and I probably
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.840]   let them I don't have this hard rule about how much screen time they have.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.480]   I do keep an eye on it.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.040]   They do have to there's a lot of rules there's there's things that have to get done.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.160]   Their rooms pretty much have to be clean if they're going to use a screen so their rooms
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.480]   are you know impeccable most of the time which is something I don't know.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.960]   Funny little rhyming thing that you make them say.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   Sorry.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   Please.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960]   I'll be on the screen.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960]   Yeah yeah.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.600]   No it's just it's just like just if they're homework they're like it.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.160]   Rooms have to be clean the homework has to be done the the and then usually there's other
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.480]   things like right now they're learning you know times tables and so they have to have
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.600]   a certain they have to meet a certain you know they have no applications sets or we
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.200]   get multiplication time you know multiplication tables.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200]   We haven't.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:03.920]   There's an interesting couple of guys in the studio today who have met for the first
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:13.480]   time they've been friends for 10 years more they met in an AOL chat room playing you
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:20.960]   go remember you go cards and they've stayed friends online this whole time and there and
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.920]   there and there and there gets there's such big geeks they're both here today.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.680]   Zeke you and John or did one of you drag the other one say oh here's something or did
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.760]   you both know about to it.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.200]   So as he kills been a fan forever yeah.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:45.240]   All right and he's making John now so experience but that's an example actually that's a that's
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.160]   a really neat example right of how you could meet in cyberspace and be friends.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.720]   I got my I got my job at Lucasfilm by posting on a well there you go.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.360]   You know so it was definitely I mean and the AOL chat forums that those used to be the
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:04.600]   stuff forums for technical stuff and and I still have friends that I've only met probably
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.920]   three or four times but I've known them since the early 90s.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:13.440]   Yeah well I'm just maybe I'm just anti social maybe that's just that's the that's the real
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.040]   truth of the of the whole thing.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.800]   Let me take a break more to come our show today brought to you by FreshBooks the ridiculously
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.760]   easy to use cloud accounting software that helps small business owners thrive and I say
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.000]   that from personal experience because I started using FreshBooks back before Twit when I was
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.920]   just you know a freelancer going to Canada once a month to do a call for help up there
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   in Toronto and I'd have to invoice them at the end of every month for my time my expenses
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.680]   all that and I hated doing it I put it off and of course learned a valuable lesson if
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.360]   you don't send bills you don't get paid.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.960]   I remember my car I was bemoaning my fate one day to Amber MacArthur and she said you should
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:04.240]   try FreshBooks FreshBooks had just started up in Toronto if this is back 2005 2006 I
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.760]   it was awesome I was able to make invoices quickly they did the currency conversion because
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.440]   I was billing them in Canadian dollars they do any currency in the world I could take pictures
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.680]   with the FreshBooks app of my expenses they'd go right into the invoices if you do time
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.600]   and hours you can have they have a little timer on the phone or a timer on the website
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:30.520]   it's a tiredly thing is that just the process of that actually was doing my accounting a
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:35.920]   lot of small business owners never really know if they're making money until the end
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.800]   of the year when it's tax time do we make money with FreshBooks you know at any time

[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   apple has fixed the bagel there were some complaints about the apple bagel emoji this
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:01.880]   is the before it looks like it's made out of foam rubber perfectly flawless this is the
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.400]   app after this will be done that looks like a bagel you'd want to eat doesn't it it's
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:13.320]   nice and fluffy making me hungry it's got cream cheese smeared on it I feel like we
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:21.200]   need Renee on this yes because he says Montreal is the only true bagel yeah and and I mean I
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.120]   don't mean to be rude but I didn't realize there was a difference but I'm from California
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.280]   our bagel suck so far as far as I know bagels are all the same well they ruined you know
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.640]   you go somewhere like Noah's you assume you're getting a real New York bagel you're not even
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.400]   in New York they've ruined the bagel because they're making them puffy and fluffy in the
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:44.520]   and the holes are getting smaller but a real bagel is boiled first and baked in the holes
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.640]   or time anyway apparently Montreal's less great bagel I have to say looking at the bagel
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.720]   emojis I'm definitely not having a Microsoft bagel and looks like what a donut what is
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.440]   that Google's not so bad at least it's got sesame seeds on it Samsung's toasted and
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.840]   what the hell is this Twitter it looks like a macaron it looks like a baked apple or
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.400]   something what the hell is that Twitter that ain't no bagel it's red and I think is these
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:20.640]   were the other options and somehow Apple was like taking the task yeah the other one the
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.400]   other one still look better than all the other options and so but I applaud them for reacting
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.480]   so quickly well to people care about their bagels I think yeah I don't think Apple's
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.520]   was that bad in hindsight not compared to Twitter but the new one is really good bagel
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.880]   does look a little bit more like and fluffy Noah's bagel though yes no you're right see
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:49.000]   how small that hole is yeah yeah but the schmear makes a difference I think yeah yeah and I really
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   just I can't be a judge of a good bagel versus does not a good bagel because I don't really
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.400]   know what that tastes like but where's the locks there I think there needs to be a bagel
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.880]   and locks locks or a little white fish mmm sort of pushing
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:10.400]   uh Marnay Richie does weigh in on Twitter he says it's still round bread not a bagel
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:16.720]   yeah there you go yeah and he uh and uh he says he wants to file a radar with apple fixing
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.600]   it it says it's still bad he says this this is what a bagel should look like well I admit
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:28.800]   that while that looks make you fail a drug test because of the poppy seeds then it's not
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:36.800]   a bagel yeah that is those bagels look a little whizzened to be honest with you according to
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.840]   Renee that's what a bagel looks like yeah well so there you go I guess it's the Montreal
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:48.440]   style bagel you know maybe I'll be able to see Renee in a couple weeks and if if that
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.600]   does happen I'm gonna make him bring me some of these Montreal bagels so that I can decide
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.760]   for myself if there is good he says they are I think they're I think you're right Laura
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.200]   I think there's a there's a put up or I feel as though there should be a put up or shut
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.840]   up factor if someone insists oh that's not pizza this is pizza or oh no no that's not
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.720]   a marinara sauce it's like fine but once you pass four point two minutes in your orang
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.960]   you're obligated to show me quote what a real marinara sauce unquote or what a real bagel
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   is like but this it's it's it's it sounds silly and maybe the case the bagels it is kind
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.480]   of silly but it does it really but it does remind us how important emojis have become
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.960]   is because well because because it's not it's not just what people like it's what it's how
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:39.040]   people communicate with each other and so when people are feel as though they are trying
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:43.120]   to communicate using a symbol that doesn't represent them or doesn't represent how they
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:49.120]   define a certain thing that becomes like the international wrong way of doing stuff ace
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:57.200]   tilton ratcliffe of a a disabled woman that I follow on twitter is really recommend people
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:06.940]   follow her twitter she's a mortuary report m o r t m o r t u a r y r e p o r t tweeted
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.420]   last night about this that's why I want that's what that's what this this is a really cool
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:18.020]   to me that replying to retweeting the a tweet from the mojapeeta talking about exactly
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:22.420]   this issue oh if apple has received complaints and they've replaced the bagel emoji with
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:27.180]   a new design that includes cream cheese and she's and she replied saying we've revamped
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:32.140]   the bagel emoji but still don't have disabled human emojis even though disabled humans make
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:40.380]   up 20% of the population almost 60 million people and it's true that apple will be including
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:45.420]   them in the next iteration and a lot of the delay is probably because of the lack of
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:51.260]   the that the the emoji the international emoji committee has been slow in creating standards
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:56.380]   for these emojis but just it just goes to show that even though it might sound silly to talk
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:02.060]   about a bagel when you talk about if people are not if if you have people emojis and people
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:07.980]   and not every person is being represented there it becomes more it becomes a more important issue
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.300]   it becomes part of the language that is not representing all of humanity out there so I'm glad
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:19.500]   that she she tweeted that just to just to remind everybody of the stakes of emojis sometimes apple
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:26.540]   does succeed amazingly with its iOS versions 12.1 is is in beta right now and will be out sometime
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:35.020]   in the future but 53% of all iPhone or iOS devices introduced in the last four years are using iOS
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:42.940]   12 that is an amazing and 50% of all devices are using iOS 12 that is an amazing success rate
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:50.860]   especially when you compare it with google's success rate with Oreo I'm sorry pie the latest
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:59.980]   version of android which came out before iOS 12 and is currently according to android.com on 0.1
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:09.180]   percent of all android phones well I always I think that's lulu numbers it's I don't think
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:16.860]   that it tells the real story that remember that you're talking if if android p were available
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:23.900]   were compatible at launch with the same number of handsets and devices as iOS was I think you would
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:30.940]   see those 50% numbers remember that has to go it under the old method it has to go through carriers
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:35.740]   and has to go through handset makers to reach the reach the end user so right now we're pretty
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:43.660]   much just talking about pixels of pixel phones and and the the central phone I think is the only
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:49.020]   one that's compatible right now but the but the other thing is that google has it's the idea of
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:54.380]   an update to the operating system means something different on android than it does on iOS because
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:22:00.700]   so many features even like core operating system sort of stuff gets updated not through like a
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:05.260]   regular not through like a full update to the operating system but through an update to like
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.580]   google play services which is available to every phone that connects us the google play store
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:14.460]   so you can be running like android o and still have essentially android p features
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:18.300]   just by the virtue of the fact that you've you've updated this and the other thing is that
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:24.700]   remember that you don't have to don't necessarily have to wait a year for an updated calendar app
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:30.860]   or for an updated camera app because these things can be updated individually as things go so it's
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:36.140]   so it's very very true that the the ios will always have this huge advantage and it's a very very real
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:42.140]   advantage but it goes beyond simply saying oh well look and repeat only has 0.1% installation base
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:47.980]   this gets that's why it's kind of it's not a it's not a fake number but you I always feel like I
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:52.860]   have to jump in and clarify why it's not the same sort of problem as it would be if apple
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:58.540]   we're only if imagine if everybody had the ability to update to the very latest version of the
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:04.780]   iOS on the day it was released and they were said yeah actually the number that would be comparing
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:11.020]   would be comparable would be what percentage of google phones uh you know pixel phones are running
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:16.300]   uh android pie because because basically you're saying 50% of all the phones made by apple are
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:20.140]   running the latest operating system so what percentage of phones made by google are running
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:26.300]   and I don't have that number this is but that would be a closer a more risk much much more realistic
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:33.580]   yeah however I mean you know even with oreo which has been out for a year it's only you know less
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:42.140]   than 20% of all phones are running oreo so it's it's it's problematic for android because there is
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:48.300]   such a fragmentation and there's security issues with anything that's too old yeah it's the the
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:52.220]   other factor is that when you're talking about android devices you're also talking about my bike
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:57.580]   computer which is true running android three and my bike computer as well that's right yeah and
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:02.460]   you're running and a whole bunch of like blister pack phones that cost like five dollars that aren't
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:08.380]   technically capable so again it's it's important to uh this this number shouldn't be downplayed
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:15.420]   because it is a real number but the android is a different ecosystem right uh apple music is now
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:20.620]   getting some better lyrics amazon's always had very nice lyrics when you uh listen to a song on
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:26.140]   one of the echo shows for instance you get lyrics and they're really good apples music lyrics are
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:31.340]   now going to be provided by genius which is the king of the hill when it comes to uh lyric databases
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:38.140]   you know that there's an app that i i'm kind of surprised doesn't exist um i was watching again
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.580]   i'm watching my kids do media but i was watching my daughter trying to figure out how to sing to a
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.820]   song and i'm kind of surprised that maybe there is an app that i just don't know about that i
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:50.140]   couldn't find it that you can see the lyrics but you can it's kind of like karaoke but it kind of
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.780]   mixes it in with the song so you can hear your voice with the song it doesn't you know the uh
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:01.580]   um you know so you can kind of listen to it as well as sing to it um you know i i it's it's not
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:07.900]   an interesting star isn't that the app sing star am i wrong is that what it does i can't remember
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:13.020]   it's been a while since uh since i've tried but i think that's what it is it's like karaoke but
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.860]   you can use it on your phone i believe and um you just kind of listen to it yourself i think you do
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:23.260]   have to use the songs that they provide though i don't think you can just you know i just want to
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:27.580]   listen to you know that's what it seemed like like you know it was it was one of those things that
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:34.460]   it seemed like it would be something uh that would be fun you know and it's not hard tech i mean it is
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:41.820]   hard technically but it's not um you know the same you know you're supposed to have sing and i
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:48.300]   think they killed that but now they've got uh something that lets you sing along like here is um
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:56.140]   i don't know if i want to hear this but here's a guy singing along with jasmine i love that he's
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:01.500]   cosplaying that and he's actually got a little says on and a vest oh the actually i thought that
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:05.340]   was a man bun so now i think that no i think now i think more highly of them than it's because
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:15.100]   so but it's i wonder if he's seeing the lyrics huh i think it's just the songs that they provide
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:21.340]   for that though i don't think you can just like listen to something and have it kind of mixed in
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:25.660]   it just seemed like it would be if someone's listening it seems like it would be i i don't know
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:29.420]   i would never use it but i but i think that when i looked at it and looked at how how my daughter
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.580]   was using it i was like i think that she would she would enjoy that but i you know then i went on to
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:37.020]   something else you know that because you know taking out for instance even the voice the voice
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:41.740]   is usually centered and so usually you can it's not so hard to take it out yeah do a polarity shift
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:45.500]   right and just pull the pull the voice right out you'll hear like a little echo of it but that's
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:50.700]   i had a karaoke machine with a DJ a long time ago at weddings and so having a karaoke machine was
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:56.220]   useful i used to i used to do it when we had turntables you flip the polarity on the uh cartridge it would
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:01.820]   work i just had a button i just like just push a button and it was like i think the idea is that
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:06.140]   you're canceling the left and the right out by flipping the polarity and so the thing that
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:10.220]   anything in the center anything that was mixed in the center would yeah cancel itself out and so
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:14.140]   uh so you gotta you lose a little bit of the song but you get most of it and uh someone could
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.460]   just sing over top of it it was uh it was quite nice here's a comparison maybe that uh is more
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:26.700]   germane between apple and androids the app store generated 93 percent more revenue than google play
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:33.340]   in the third quarter this is according to sensor tower and and i first misread that it's not 93
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:37.180]   percent of the revenue it's just almost twice almost twice the revenue they could have said yeah
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.340]   they could have said it produced almost twice that there would have been a better headline wouldn't it
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:48.460]   yeah uh even more accurate but that's not an insignificant amount of money 18.2 billion dollars
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:57.180]   in q3 2018 from the app store 18.2 billion dollars google play store 6.2 billion dollars
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:05.820]   it's it's not the total amount is a lot one way or the other it's not bad for a hobby jeez
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:13.180]   well again the the the great thing about modern journalism is that we can produce a think piece
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:19.420]   on any point of view uh if i had if i had an android blog i would say new statistics prove
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:24.780]   that uh an iphone is more than twice as expensive to operate month after month
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:34.940]   an android phone uh there's a lot of money in apps no matter how you look at it have you
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:40.380]   have you gotten into kind of a uh i think uh i just can't do any more subscriptions you know i've
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:44.300]   gotten i i reached some point where i deleted like huge amounts of i suddenly realized how many
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:49.420]   subscriptions i had done and i deleted them and now i'm just won't do it you know like i just and i
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.420]   think that there was this there's push to buy stuff and then there was a push to do subscriptions
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:58.540]   and i think now i i just want to buy the app well the money most of them yeah i agree i wish more
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:03.820]   games are like that but most uh the games that are high revenue games or games with in-app purchases
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:11.260]   for items like fortnite right where the number one uh game uh in terms of revenue ios and android
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:16.700]   for q3 2018 i've never even heard of it's called honor of king this from 10 cent which is a big
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.900]   publisher of these style games then monster strike fate grand order i've not heard of any of these
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:28.540]   lineage m oh there's one i've heard of pokemon go is number five candy gresh saga number six
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:36.700]   fantasy westward journey dbz dachin battle fortnite number nine clash of clans number 10 so this this
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:41.660]   list gets shucked up pretty regularly clash of clans fortnite used to be on top
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:47.020]   um i'm just amazed that i don't play fortnite at all and i'm just amazed though that there's now
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:50.460]   football players out there do i i was like what are they doing and they're like and even the
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.820]   announcers are like that's not a very good fortnite dance i'm right that's like wow that's that's uh
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:30:02.380]   that's amazing that's that's making it difficult for me to get into mobile gaming i just i'll see a
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:07.900]   game that looks kind of interesting and i'm almost and i'm about to get it and then i then i see that
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:12.220]   oh it's free with an app purchases and it makes me think how much fun am i allowed to have with
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:18.220]   this before i have to cough up like another five or ten bucks i have a i did buy like uh the uh
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:23.180]   the nintendo mini and i buy these consoles and they come out because it's the only way that i can
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:30.380]   get like cool cool if old archaic i know that i'm i'm like 80 dollars upfront but then nothing ever
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:36.140]   again and that's a feature to me you have to give props to game developers that are making these
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:42.140]   free within app purchase games they've gotten so much better at giving you a good quality game
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:47.660]   that doesn't cost money and then presenting you with options to buy um well and i always look in
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:52.380]   the reviews because reviewers will almost always say oh this game was pretty fun even though i didn't
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:57.340]   have to buy anything or don't bother because it's gonna cost you two hundred dollars to have any
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:03.180]   fun at all yeah and and there's been when if you know when the free to play games first came out you
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:08.540]   really did feel like you couldn't play more than a half an hour of a game or maybe even a day or
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:13.580]   you know a couple hours worth of a game before you felt compelled to either pay or stop playing
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:18.380]   and a lot of these games have figured out a way to let you engage in it and play it and play it
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:23.020]   for hours at a time and then presents you present you with an option of you know if you want to
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:27.740]   enhance your gameplay here's these things that you could buy or they'll have events where um
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:32.860]   they're timed events and in order to kind of like maximize the amount of time you have to get through
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:37.020]   the event you can pay some extra money to kind of help you get through it i think those are sort
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:45.340]   of brilliant ways to navigate the the free to play in app purchase um sort of game which it really
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:50.620]   is the dominant game on mobile devices and and no game developer is going to just say well we're
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:54.460]   just not gonna do that because they know they're gonna make a lot of money at it but if you can
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:32:01.900]   figure out a way to balance good gameplay you're gonna get the players are going to want to spend
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:06.700]   money they're gonna feel good that they spent that they got to play as much as they did and want to
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:12.060]   continue to spend there for example because you don't you can play fortnite to the cows come home
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:17.580]   without spending any money the game mechanics are not affected by it the your ability to win is
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:24.460]   not affected by it it's purely dance moves and costumes decorative stuff and it's and it makes
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:29.660]   millions when people get excited about being able to play fortnite they're more willing to spend
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:33.580]   large amounts of money because they feel good about the game they feel good about it they don't
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:38.300]   feel like you've been manipulated into it yeah exactly that's why i stopped playing simpson's
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:44.700]   tapped out i felt like i had to buy donuts actually pokemon goes the same way you could play that
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:50.860]   game without spending a penny but but it's uh but it but you might be incented to buy things
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:54.620]   and then and then of course you have the other side like my favorite we still my favorite game we
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:59.340]   know i'm i get into ruts but i still play fieldrunners you know and i i think that poor subatomic
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:04.220]   studios i don't think that they're around anymore i don't i you haven't changed the thing in a while
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:10.700]   have they well the website hasn't been updated since january 2017 so i think that uh things didn't
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.180]   you know they and if you click on their their headline you end up with some other page anyway so
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:20.940]   um you know so i think that you know i if they are they should they should contact me because um
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.900]   it's still great if you haven't played fieldrunners it's amazing the awesomest game
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:29.980]   it's just i play it when i fly like there's this time between when you take off and when they
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:34.860]   serve the meal and there's just it's like a no man's land you can't really put your computer up you
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:38.460]   can't really you don't know when they're gonna come and that's why i play a brown or two fieldrunners
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:43.980]   and i yeah i just play the same level over until i get to a point where i'm like it can't i can't
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:51.980]   do this anymore the copy right on the page is uh 2011 well it's the last posting was on 2017 i
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:58.460]   think of january 2017 and then i click the about button and i get entertainment today insider news i
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:05.500]   know i know i was like what what this is basically an ad i think yeah the uh i think what happened
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:10.140]   was the feel like for me i never played fieldrunner attack and i think that i might be a lot like a
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:15.500]   lot of folks because it required you to connect with somebody else and and uh i just was playing on
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:19.500]   a plane it was hard guys if you're look here's the picture of all these guys at the subatomic
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:23.740]   guys and gals at subatomic studio they're in kambridge massachusetts if you're listening to this show
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:31.020]   please contact Alex lindsey he doesn't take phone emails or but text him you can you can find me
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:35.260]   twitter or email and we're fine i'm i love you guys i love your i love your game i love you man
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:41.260]   yeah it takes me a long time to go from one i i did try fortnight i went out and and then i
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.180]   got killed immediately and i was like i don't like to scamish there uh there looks like their last
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:53.020]   tweet was february 2017 and then they just disappeared into a fourth dimensional fold
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:58.380]   and i've never been seen again that is weird isn't it when that kind of like it's like it's like a
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:03.180]   one hit wonder band and you wonder what happened to them where they are now and can you can you get
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:08.300]   the band back together for one one gig there's probably a hole behind the music of behind the
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:14.620]   app that's that's what they would be a great show the apps why does an apple do that i know you
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:20.460]   it's you know i i will you know uh you might have said that off-handedly but if i found out that
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:25.100]   there was a show whether it was just some person doing it on youtube or whether it was on hulu
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:31.660]   where you you did a tire like 12 episode season of just looking for apps that are good but they
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:38.220]   haven't been updated for like at least four years and it looks as though their social media is not
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:44.460]   existent their url it now goes to like someone else find out what happened to that app what the
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:49.660]   why they stopped uh stop doing it i know that all of it will be well we basically realize that we put
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:54.300]   we be paying ourselves about 12 cents an hour with all the effort we put it and all the money
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:59.020]   that it made and we decided to do better things with our Tuesday after years but i would watch
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:05.260]   that show i would watch that behind hey where are they now sort of anthologies series of yes yeah
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:13.500]   uh maybe this is apple's plan because according to cnbc they don't want to charge for all that
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:20.860]   billion dollars worth of original content they're creating their this is there this was a shock
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:26.300]   when i read this they're planning to mix free original content with subscription channels
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:32.380]   to existing digital video services on the tv app in other words the the billion dollars you're
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:38.780]   spending on original content is just a come on just window dressing it's just window dressing
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:47.420]   to get what an apple tv or an ios company i wish i had a company that was so big that i could spend
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:53.820]   a billion dollars on the last leader wow it's marketing i mean they've got i think they've got
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:59.660]   Oprah doing this they've got everybody you don't need an apple music subscription even it's literally
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:07.180]   just free as long as you have a device no one knows this is the rumor yes if if you have a device
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:11.980]   it doesn't seem surprising well but but in some ways not because they're really pushing that tv app
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:18.380]   right i will say that if they bundled if they simply bundled it with music it would be you know
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:22.380]   it wouldn't be necessarily free it'd be free to all those people that already have music but it
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:26.860]   really puts a lot of pressure on spotify you know because now it's like oh i sign up for apple music
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:31.180]   i get i get all these shows as well instead of you know that would put an immense amount of
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:35.180]   pressure on spotify if apple star spending a billion dollars and just bundled the media together
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:41.580]   so that could be another option owners of this is again according to sources the cnbc uh
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:47.180]   uh anonymous sources the owners of apple devices such as the iphone ipad and apple tv will find the
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:52.940]   still in the work service in the pre-installed tv application the product will include apple owned
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:58.460]   content which will be free to apple device owners and subscription channels it'll they liken it to
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:06.460]   amazon's prime video app which includes free stuff for amazon's prime subscribers and then paid stuff
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:11.900]   for those who you know want to buy additional stuff because there's fairly simple for me too
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:17.020]   i mean i was a prime member it just suddenly i had all these shows that i didn't know i had before
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:21.580]   you know it's not like i subscribed to something to get them i just i already had it yeah apple has
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:31.340]   24 original shows in production and development yeah i think it does point to i did if the tv app
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:38.380]   looks rather fallow and unimportant i think they've parked that on the on the launch screen for
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:45.260]   something that they know is coming later i it's i mean the uh i often forget completely that i've
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:51.100]   got all this free tv content with amazon prime because i'm just not conditioned into
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:57.340]   calving the amazon tv amazon video app on all my devices and so when i complain that oh boy why
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:02.780]   can't i get archer why can't get this other this other tv show that's not on hulu it's like oh wait
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:08.700]   i've remembered i forgot completely that i've been paying for this tv content and now paying a
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:15.900]   surprising amount of money for this tv content uh the uh i i still think that the amazon prime cost
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:21.340]   80 or 90 dollars until i get the annual bill and find out that no you're about paying 10 bucks a
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:26.620]   month for it uh and it's worth it but it's it's amazing i'm paying so much for service and forgetting
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:31.660]   all the features that i get with it beyond getting free second-day delivery one i and i wonder whether
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:38.300]   apples play is that hey we're building this great garden where you as you know uh time Warner or
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:43.180]   as other studios can grow your your vegetables you know like like we're not we're not trying to
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:47.660]   replace you you know you you Netflix is basically like we're gonna keep doing this with this contract
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.860]   with you until we totally replace you and drown you you know like you know like they're like they're
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:57.900]   not Netflix is not you know there's 700 shows and 80 uh 80 movies in production this you know they're
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:02.060]   gonna be released over the next year i mean they are replacing hollywood you know they're not they're
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:07.020]   not trying to they're you know they're you know and and and the reality is their content is good enough
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.460]   to do that most of the time um but the i think apple might be doing more of a we're gonna create
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:17.980]   big shiny things to bring think people to this location but then they want to buy subscriptions
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:24.220]   from you and try to kind of uh that that might be a unique angle over what Netflix and arguably
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:27.180]   what am i saying and the other thing and the other thing that they have the ability to say
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:32.860]   touching on something we just finished talking about is they can demonstrate that people on ios
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:38.300]   buy things they don't they they've got money they spend money much more than they do on android
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:43.980]   devices and so if they say that if you basically if you let us if you include this pack part of the
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:50.700]   package in with a free for free for apple users and you have links below of hey buy
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:55.020]   press this button right now and we'll let you have another two seasons of this they will probably
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:41:00.620]   buy another two seasons of it of course part of the problem apple has is they don't want anything
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:07.340]   to edgy sexy political and religious wall street journals headline in this regard no sex please
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:15.260]   we're apple uh and they killed apparently killed the dr dray uh biopic vialis I was amazed when when
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:19.500]   they talked about that years ago I was just like they're really doing that apple is doing that I
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:23.020]   just I didn't understand but I again I think there's a pretty big model I mean you know Pixar's
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:28.060]   a pretty big uh world yeah so yeah so yeah I don't think that necessarily lots of stuff they could
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:34.620]   do the yeah although when apparently there's a show that they're producing that sounded a little
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:42.460]   edgy m night shamal and has a new series on there and they asked him to remove it's about a couple
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:48.220]   that's lost their child I think and they asked him to remove all the crucifixes in the couple's house
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:54.540]   because they didn't want any religious content so they're that I mean they're being and I you
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:57.740]   know when it's apple that doesn't surprise me they don't want to be yeah they don't want to be
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:03.100]   controversial I'm keen to see five a few years after this really launches for real
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:09.660]   conversations with people who had to who were working with apple and how bad it was right to
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:16.060]   be focusing on telling a great story and then you find out that you know there's a poster for a rock
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:22.460]   and roll band in the kids room if it were just rock or just roll we'd be cool with it but if you
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:27.740]   could change it to like an orange juice and orange juice poster like so much relief
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:32.620]   micro because you know I think people love micro management they can't get enough of it yeah
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:37.980]   I know we had this conversation a couple weeks ago but it like that is part part for the course
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:42.380]   I mean that is Hollywood yeah some producer asking for some cockamade thing that yeah it's just
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.900]   that is what happens all the one last story and we're gonna take a break for our picks of the
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:52.620]   week and the story is a sad one of course Paul Allen who was co-founder of Microsoft worth about
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.940]   five billion dollars he owned the Seattle Seahawks apart on trailblazers he owned at one-time tech
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:04.780]   tv has passed away at the age of 65 he had left Microsoft in 82 because he had Hodgkins
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:12.140]   it went into remission and he was able to lead a completely normal life but apparently non-Hodgens
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:19.580]   lymphoma researched last year he announced that he had restarted treatment for the cancer just two
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:27.900]   weeks ago and he's now passed away so a lot of people with a lot of tributes especially in the
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:33.580]   Seattle area where he was beloved because of his generosity his love of sports his love of the
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:39.180]   arts he built that amazing experience music project now it's called mopop which is an amazing
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:43.820]   museum in Seattle if you haven't seen it the Frank Geary building is designed to look like a melted
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:50.780]   guitar he was a huge Jimi Hendrix fan I sorry he was worth more than 20 billion dollars 20 billion
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:57.420]   dollars gave two billion to philanthropies and took Bill Gates giving pledge a commitment to give
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:03.980]   away the majority of his wealth in 2018 yeah he gave away a lot of his wealth running tech tv into
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:13.660]   that wasn't his fault that was why he sold it in 2004 yeah he also was he also was part of the team
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:20.220]   that won the won the the X prize for first commercial flight into space right so that was i was i
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:25.740]   was actually there at the launch and boy you saw if you ever saw a man so happy that's watching
[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:31.100]   this thing launch and watching it come back again what what an interesting life he led not to put
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:37.100]   not cast aspersions against other billionaires but you it's it gives an outsider like me
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:42.620]   pleasure to see that not only did he lead a life of adventure but also he led a life of philanthropy
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:48.780]   I had a lot of a great deal of respect for the company he built and the life he led that's
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:57.180]   it was a sad sad piece of news yeah 65 years old um too early yeah as a as someone who's
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:03.500]   nearing that age definitely definitely too early uh let's take a break and come back in just a
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:09.900]   minute with your picks lady and gentlemen prepare your picks but first a word i got a pick for you
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:16.940]   from last pass last pass is my pick for your password vault if you are using passwords and we
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:22.140]   all do nowadays you've got to memorize dozens hundreds of them you may be tempted to do things
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:27.500]   people do like use the same password over and over make your password easy to memorize by making
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:34.620]   your dog's name and your son's birthday these are all bad ideas and if your employees are doing it
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:41.980]   in your business they could be disaster for your business that's why we use last pass enterprise and
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:48.460]   as a benefit of employment give a copy of last pass to every employee we want you to protect
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:53.820]   your passwords especially when there are passwords last pass enterprise makes password sharing
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:59.500]   convenient for employees but keeping access to corporate data secure you can completely
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:04.220]   customize access including the ability to set master password requirements you can enable
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:11.020]   password resets restrict access as needed over a hundred policies security reports you can get
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:16.460]   shared folders we use those for instance the ops team has a folder the accounting team has a folder
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:20.780]   so it's very easy to share passwords with the people who need access and keep it from the people
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:29.580]   who don't i use it so much that i put everything in including ssh keys past passports drivers license
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:36.940]   all our business information is in there if you if you want you can in turn on require two-factor
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:41.580]   authentication that's what we do with the last pass authenticator app it's really easy it's just a
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:46.940]   button of a verification button a notification that pops up on the employees phone that they
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:51.500]   just push and says yes that was me which i think is important because you got to you got to make
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:55.580]   this stuff convenient for your employees or they'll start doing things like writing passwords on
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:47:01.020]   post-it notes and putting on the screen but with a multi-factor authentication even that wouldn't
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:06.380]   be enough for a bad guy last password generator use it all the time make unique random passwords
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:10.140]   and of course you don't have to remember it because it's stored in your last pass vault
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:17.260]   by the way on ios 12 now auto fill on your phone and tablet which means when in install new apps
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:24.060]   it just fills it in i love that feature it's also an android just think that's so cool
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:29.980]   auto fill another thing that makes it easy to keep long strong passwords and your data is always
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:34.380]   safe encrypted and decrypted only at the device level data and the vault always kept secret even
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:40.780]   from last pass and if you use active directory in your business employees can log into last pass
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:44.860]   with their active directory credentials which really means they only have a number one password
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:50.300]   and for access to everything we love last pass last pass premium for personal use last pass
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:55.500]   families it's what i use at home for our entire family last pass teams for small businesses and
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:02.140]   of course last pass enterprise that's what we use more than 16 million people and 43 000 businesses
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:08.860]   trust last pass the number one most preferred password manager find out more go to last pass
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:15.260]   dot com slash twit it's the first app i install whenever i get a new device i love it last pass
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:20.700]   dot com slash twit andy and not go time for a pick of the week
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:27.100]   my pick of the week is a movie this week that i found on hulu documentary and absolutely loved
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:32.140]   loved just so much i bought the blu ray uh as soon as uh as soon as the movie was over it's called
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:38.620]   stradd style uh and uh i don't want to i won't give things away i will only give you here here is the
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:46.540]   pitch for the movie you have this guy who lives in rural ohio i mean rural by the capital ruh uh and
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:52.700]   he gets to know an international concert violinist sort of on facebook uh saying oh well you know i
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:58.060]   make guitars and i make violins and i could make a violin for you and the international concert
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:03.740]   violinist says in response kind of half jokingly well why why don't you uh oh make me violin well
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:11.260]   how about uh how about the cannon uh il kennone this legendary violin with an amazing loud sound
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:18.380]   that paginini used to play and he said sure i can make you a copy of that sure no problem uh and he
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:24.780]   he doesn't have like a workshop he has he's doing stuff like on his sofa he's using tools and
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:31.340]   class from harper freight and you don't really know if he's just a bs artist or whether he's
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:37.580]   kind of like a genius sort of person who's just a talented like instrument maker who doesn't need
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:44.220]   a fancy shop uh and that this is sort of a mystery that i don't want to sort of reveal or reveal how
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:52.060]   things happen but it's an amazing story not only about the making of uh there's a attempt to make
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:57.580]   this violin uh and if he'll make it as promised for this concert that this guy is going to be
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:03.740]   performing but also of a creative person and the sort of life he leads very very interesting uh
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:10.060]   it's not exploitative uh it really it gets into the soul of uh of an individual uh no matter what
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:16.460]   he's doing uh and i guess i loved it so much that i was so for i was so grateful to have found it
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:20.620]   and then again it was worth me immediately finding out where i could get a copy of the
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:25.420]   blu-ray and then buying it this looks fascinating i love documentary stradd right high recommend
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:33.580]   style a hot doc all right thank you for the pick laurie gill what do you got for us today
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:43.100]   so um my pick is old and new all at the same time it's the uh libritone zip which is a wireless
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:51.740]   bluetooth speaker um they just recently updated to support airplay too so i don't mean a new speaker
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:57.340]   that's coming soon because they do have the zip too that's coming soon i mean the current zip the
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:02.060]   one that anybody who bought the zip has in their house with an update it now supports airplay too
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:07.660]   and i'm all in on this airplay support with speakers i have two home pods i have a sonos beam now i
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:12.940]   can add libritone zip to my collection of music that plays all over the place it's a really good
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:20.220]   quality portable speaker um it's cute too it's cute yeah and it's probably the best quality in terms of
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:25.660]   the fact that it's intended to be portable so it's intended to be used outside and taken with you
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:30.860]   to park some picnics and things like that um so it's got a really really great sound and airplay
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:36.940]   too a compatible compatibility to me is like a really great thing that i i look forward to more
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:43.260]   more speakers being able to have and a lot of companies have pledged support and still not come
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:48.620]   through so libritone is the next in line of companies who have pledged support for airplay and it's
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:54.540]   finally available now so if anybody already has a zip in their house and they didn't know it just
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:59.020]   make sure that you update the app and then the app will update the speaker and then the speaker
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:04.700]   will be airplay too compatible and if you don't you can actually buy the zip too it's um not out yet
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:10.380]   but i think it's coming late october or early november so you can just get the zip too and it
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:17.820]   comes with airplay too automatically nice good choice thank you lori gill thank you for being here
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:25.580]   too we really appreciate thank you i love me i'm out from your busy day Alex lindsey who also has a
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:31.180]   busy day but i bet he has a pic of the week as well i do uh so one of the things i just found
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:34.620]   myself using a lot i thought i couldn't believe that i hadn't recommended it but i did the little
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:41.900]   search on mbw picks and uh have you used ta tae su sui tae su sketches i can't i don't know if i'm
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:50.860]   saying it correctly taiya sui taiya sui taiya sui no i never heard of it it's a great little sketch
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:56.140]   you know it's a great sketch app it's available on the mac it's also available on the ipad and
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:01.820]   i realize this is what i'm using most of the time so i have i have the pro version and i if i'm
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:06.780]   sketching something out that i actually wanted to look like something um you know this is what i
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:11.900]   end up kind of pulling out and i just find that the the simplicity as well as the tools uh you know
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:16.380]   are really nice there's lots of great drawing tools on the ipad it's kind of an amazing environment
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:22.140]   for for sketching but i find this one there's something about it that is just the right mix of
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.900]   clean and complexity that that i uh that i definitely enjoy when i'm when i'm putting together concept
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:33.980]   concept ideas for whatever we're working on um you know mine is less artistic probably and more
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:39.580]   detailed around trying to just visualize something that i need someone else to make a better version
[01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:44.780]   of so but uh but i realized that i just that this is one that i was using i had i had
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:48.860]   i had to recommend it because i've been using it for years now i think so anyway it's uh it's
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:53.420]   really good sketch app if you're still not happy with the ones that you already have and it's not
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:56.780]   i don't think i don't think it's very expensive to buy but the pro and not only the pro version is
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:01.980]   that expensive i'm looking at it on a site called set app i guess you buy set app and you get a
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:06.780]   bunch of other apps including taiya suey is there are there other ways to get taiya suey without
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:11.180]   doing uh yeah i just bought it i i primarily use it on my ipad i just bought it on the app store i
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:17.500]   just did so that i think uh this is what i'm done with yeah that's the uh there is a there's an app for
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:24.140]   the uh for the mac as well um so i think that might be what that is um but the but you can just buy it
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:30.140]   as a as an app on the on the app store as well nice hi i i was a luke go ahead i'm sorry go ahead
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:35.260]   i have set up and it's actually pretty amazing just wanted to point that out it's basically
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:40.940]   it's like Netflix for apps on your mac so it's pretty awesome oh i should check it out so
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:47.980]   taiya suey uh at taiya suey t-a-y-a-s-u-i.com has a bunch of other stuff including doodle book
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:53.980]   taiya suey sketches sketches mac taiya suey color so there are a bunch of different apps and you
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:59.340]   can find them all but you're recommending sketches what are you recommending that's the one sketches
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:03.020]   yeah the sketches is the one that i use a lot now that i see that there's a bunch of other ones i'm
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:06.700]   like i probably should have looked at those two but but i yeah that's the one i use and it's
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:11.020]   actually the one my uh my daughter uses a lot as well she's got it on her ipad nice she
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:16.780]   she this is the one that uh she sketches a lot on too very nice i wish i could draw
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:23.900]   maybe i could have if i had a high back row and it's not anyone can draw it's just being able to
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:31.260]   draw well it's the is that oh no no it's it's it's all about losing losing any contact with the
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:37.420]   desire to draw well and just drawing oh honest to god that's my problem as soon as you forget
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:43.020]   that's what i mean but i wish i could draw i mean i wish i could draw well we have to somehow get
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:48.060]   i'm still i've been trying to persuade uh one of my old friends a guy named Ian McKeig to
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:52.940]   to come do a class you know and we started trying to do a video about it he is he's the character
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:59.180]   designer for star wars and he is um the one of the most amazing artists that i've worked with i've
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:04.060]   had you know there's a lot of amazing artists that look as film and i online but but he is uh he's
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:07.900]   so passionate about teaching people how to do it he's he gave us in the pixel core years ago like
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:12.380]   these 10 steps on how to draw and it was like how to understand weight how to understand shading how
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:16.700]   to and just give you this little thing to play with and we've been trying to get him to re-record
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:21.020]   it and it's but you literally get through it and you're twice as good you know as you know like
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:26.780]   well that wouldn't be hard i but but i mean it's just like twice nothing ain't much but i i've seen
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:31.180]   him take someone like he had someone i think intern forum for like a month and he lives up in
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:35.340]   bictory i think it was a month that he had them draw every day with him and it was like it was
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:38.620]   more miraculous so we're trying to figure out a way to feel like i have a
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:47.260]   oven mitt for a hand and i draw it turns out it turns out it's just i slowly get better i don't
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:51.900]   do enough of it but i it turns out you just have to do a lot of it well god like i got the tools
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:57.020]   like it all sorts of tools there's a there's a page from a robert crumb sketchbook that i used to
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:02.540]   have like printed out and like pinned up in my old office we're beautifully drawn and beautifully
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:06.540]   letered by robert crumb it was a note to himself saying wish you could draw better
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:09.340]   then get to work
