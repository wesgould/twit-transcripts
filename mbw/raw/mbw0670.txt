[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.560]   A second Zoom vulnerability and a second fix from Apple.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.920]   And why is the 2019 MacBook Air just a little bit slower than last year's?

[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.960]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Apple News.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   And we're going to have a fun day today.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.720]   Renee Richie is on assignment.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.080]   Yeah, you know what that means.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.400]   He's getting briefed by Apple about something.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.280]   I feel like something's going on only because Apple closed the app store yesterday.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.680]   Not the app store, the Mac store where you buy Apple gear yesterday.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.560]   And then we're down. We'll be back up for some big changes.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.440]   It'll be out of the shop.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   And then nothing happened.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.240]   But I feel like something's in them works.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.120]   Anyway, we'll find out.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   In Renee's place, we've got the great Dave the Nerd.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.000]   Dave Hamilton from Mac, observer. Hello, Dave.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.080]   Hey, Leo. Thanks for having me.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.800]   And your studio.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   I am happily here in my studio.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.640]   That's right. I'll go play the drums later.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.960]   Nice.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   You have a huge variety of percussive devices behind you.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.680]   Oh, you aren't seeing half of them.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.240]   Yep. It's an addiction, but that's okay.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.920]   I do this tech thing to fuel that.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.840]   So how long have you been doing Mac, observer?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.800]   We just celebrated our 20th year in business.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.600]   Believe it or not.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.840]   I know. And we've been doing Mac Geek.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.040]   Our weekly podcast for over 14 years now.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.160]   So yeah, it's crazy.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.120]   We're getting old. That's all I can say.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.840]   Yeah, but we're still doing it.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   So I think that's better than the alternative.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.600]   You don't look older.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.680]   That's the thing that bugs me, but okay.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.280]   I'm okay with it.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.840]   Okay.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.800]   I was using that face app or whatever it was
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.360]   that you were talking about.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.240]   Yeah, it was that funny.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.960]   I had it had been decades since I had seen
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.280]   the spitting image of my grandfather.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.720]   And I put it in old mode.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.160]   And I had a teary moment that I looked exactly like him in that app.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   So if I get old, that's okay, right?
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.760]   He was one of my favorite people.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.480]   I looked like Freddy Krueger.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.920]   So I didn't really have that moment.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.040]   Right.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   Yeah, you had a different moment.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.040]   I saw it.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.680]   We were having different experiences together.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.120]   Unpleasant experience.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080]   Also with his Andy Inako,
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   once again in the Boston Public Library,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.840]   where he lives,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.920]   there's a little tiny Inako over your,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.480]   don't look now,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.800]   but there's a little tiny Inako over your left shoulder.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.200]   It'll be okay.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.920]   I'm sure he's not.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.720]   That's okay.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.160]   Take over or anything.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.600]   So, you know, so actually,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.120]   if we can just tag in and tag out,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   that would help me a lot because I got.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.280]   I got a whole bunch of deadlines this week.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.880]   No, no boats in a bottle though,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   behind you today.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.000]   Well, now I'm facing the other way,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.280]   because now,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   because now I have like my actual lighting setup here.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.840]   Oh, it looks good.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.920]   Maybe I could like open the curtains,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.120]   and you could see like the beautiful lake
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   with the turns and the ducks behind me.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.640]   But it's still a little bit too.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.480]   Maybe once rainy outside, we'll do that.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.680]   And from the punk rock,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.720]   post-punk band,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.440]   Sickburn,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   I give you lead singer Lori Gill.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.720]   She also happens to be the owner of iMore.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.640]   And it looks like you're in a radio station today.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.560]   You've got albums and a turntable
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.320]   and a wolf man jack behind you.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.200]   And or no, I'm sorry,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   that's not wolf man jack.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.320]   That's a little Richard.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.680]   I'm talking about little little
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.960]   retchers over your shoulder.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   Hi, Lori.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.680]   Do you want to see what I'll look like when I'm old?
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.880]   Do you want to just see that?
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.680]   Yeah, I do.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.480]   This is terrifying.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.520]   I don't know.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.040]   You have to zoom in on that car soon.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.960]   Really, really get the full effect.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.000]   This is what happens if you use face app
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.200]   and you're already old.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.920]   You get even older.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.320]   I'm going to send that to my mom.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.200]   Say, what happened?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.280]   That's like one of those apples.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.480]   I look like an apple doll.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.400]   One of those dried apple dolls.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.520]   Well, Dave, if like you said,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.360]   you really do look exactly like your grandfather.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.440]   Have you considered like exploiting this
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.640]   to like sort of falsify a more colorful history
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.520]   for your grandfather?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   Like you can just like.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.240]   You know, my grandfather's got a pretty colorful history
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.640]   as it is.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.840]   He's the one that invented those oval shaped
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   binocular viewing machines
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.040]   that you kind of see all over the country.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.560]   So I'm not sure I could improve.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.320]   You want to think you put a quarter into
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   so you can see Mount Rushmore up close.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.200]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.680]   Exactly.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.480]   He owes me at least seven quarters.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   You see?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.440]   This is not just just a, there's only justice deferred.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.480]   I was with my family at the Pilgrim's ship
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.560]   in Massachusetts and I only had like one dollar
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.000]   in quarters, put two of them in,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.280]   two of them got eaten,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.040]   and who didn't get ice cream that day?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.640]   Who didn't get a hoodsy cup?
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.280]   I was briefly a little nervous
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.920]   that you were going to say
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.160]   was the first treasure of the United States, Dave.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.560]   Yeah, no, thankfully.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.960]   No.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   Featured on the, what is it?
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.840]   The, what bill is Hamilton on?
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.640]   $10 bill.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.120]   $10 bill.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.480]   The 10, the 10.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.760]   I should know because it's in the song.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.440]   Thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda,
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.480]   it's still on the 10.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.520]   It was going to be replaced.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.920]   Really?
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.800]   Wow.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.080]   He let it charge, I don't know,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.360]   four or five years ago or something.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.480]   When the show Hamilton was having its peak,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.040]   he, he, he preserved the family name.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.600]   That's right.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   Yep.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.200]   Ah, let's see.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.800]   Let's take a look at the big board of Apple.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   Board being operative.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.720]   Right now, Apple's testifying, I believe,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.160]   along with Facebook and Google.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.320]   Uh, at the, uh, in front of Congress, right?
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.960]   The big, the big tech companies are telling,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.560]   I can't pull it up because my subs,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.720]   I can't log in my subscription,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.960]   uh, to the Washington Post.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.000]   I can't log in.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.720]   They're testifying.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.520]   There you go.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.400]   That, seen it.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.200]   That's a good choice.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.560]   I can log into them.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.720]   They're testifying in front of the, uh,
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.640]   House Judiciary Committee.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.920]   Uh, basically it's about antitrust, right?
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.400]   In the Facebook Libra currency and,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.360]   so the hearings have titles like online platforms
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   and market power, part two,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   innovation and entrepreneurship.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.400]   This, this is part of a year and a half long series of,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.680]   of these kind of panels that have announced,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.240]   first and foremost, about three or four weeks ago,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.360]   to take a look at every single aspect of the tech industry
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.840]   to see if there needs more regulation
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.800]   or if there is antitrust violations going on.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.040]   Uh, and it is, I partisan and fur.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   It's not, uh, well, if this is an issue that kind of, uh,
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.760]   affects voter, inspires voters on both sides of the aisle,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.000]   but this isn't just one instance of, okay,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.320]   they're calling these people out for a press conference.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.880]   We are, I'm sure are going to see some pretty serious change
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.240]   over the next couple of years,
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.440]   because again, this is an emphatic and consistent policy.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.040]   Uh, we are going to examine every aspect of the tech industries,
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.800]   particularly the ones that have become,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   uh, companies that become so huge
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.040]   that they have become almost political fiefdoms
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.760]   in and of themselves and decide if all the decisions
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.720]   that we made in 1990 on loose regulation
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.320]   need to be tightened up a little bit.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.880]   So Laurie, why Apple?
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.560]   I would say of, I mean, Google, Amazon, Facebook,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.120]   yeah, but Apple's not dominant.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   They're a small market share.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.320]   Are they, are they a monopoly?
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.960]   They, yeah, I think you can put them into that category
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.600]   in part because of the ecosystem that Apple has,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.000]   where everything is what,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.160]   I think we've heard the term the walled garden,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.480]   and Apple sort of dominates all of its own stuff.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.160]   So the App Store, for example, the iTunes,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.320]   and all of the services that are like.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.960]   I guess you could say the App Store is a monopoly
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.320]   in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.600]   Right.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.480]   But the Apple, you know,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.240]   iPhone is at best a 50% market share in the US, right?
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.640]   Uh, much smaller worldwide.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.400]   Mac OS is 5%.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   I mean, it's not like they are a dominant player
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.280]   in the technology sphere.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   Right.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.240]   But I think the reason they're being
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.440]   kind of called out in this particular situation
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.560]   is just that, is specifically that,
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.640]   they're dominating their own ecosystem.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.720]   And I think the reason they're being lumped in
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.920]   with all of these other companies
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.840]   that are significantly larger than them
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.240]   is there have been a lot of complaints of people,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.120]   you know, app developers even saying,
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.600]   you know, you're making it really difficult for us to
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.720]   participate in your playing field.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.640]   And so the general sentiment, I think, is different,
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.440]   but I can see how the government,
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.800]   not knowing the details would lump Apple into that.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.040]   Apple may not be as big as the other companies,
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.560]   but they're certainly talked about
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.040]   as much or more than the other companies.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.360]   Dave?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.680]   Yeah, well, that's just it, right?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.760]   They are one of the most popular companies on the planet,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.440]   one of the most valuable companies,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.680]   and that makes them one of the most powerful companies
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.240]   on the planet.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.000]   So I think it's, if we don't include them in these talks,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.040]   what will people say about our decisions to target
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.200]   Google, Facebook, and not Apple, right?
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.960]   So I think they have to be there.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.480]   I think there's a risk, though,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   there's a risk you don't want to look like
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.160]   you're punishing a company for being successful.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.800]   And so if you lump Apple in because,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.600]   merely because it's the most valuable company
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.520]   in the world, historically,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.200]   actually it's not right now, Microsoft is.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.680]   I don't notice, is Microsoft on these hearings?
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.640]   I don't see them.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.320]   You could argue Microsoft has a much larger percentage
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.600]   of operating system business.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   They have a monopoly in operating systems.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.840]   I don't know.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.320]   Who?
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.080]   So, okay, but I think largely the antitrust action
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.200]   against Apple is due to how they operate the App Store,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.480]   particularly how they have competitors in video,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.080]   they have competitors in music,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.000]   and those competitors, if they want to operate
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.160]   within the Apple ecosystem, have to suffer
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.400]   financial penalties that Apple itself does not have to suffer.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.160]   And then, of course, there's the closed system
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.520]   of iPhone development that you can't simply,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.000]   you have to always obey Apple's rules,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.240]   and sometimes that's for the good of consumers,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.880]   and sometimes arguably that's for the good of Apple.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.240]   So I think the stakes aren't quite as high for Apple
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.560]   as they are for Facebook and Google,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.000]   particularly how those two companies
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.080]   have been operating the advertising business.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.560]   But they're not just there because they're making
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.360]   too much money and they have to be part of this collection.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.200]   Elizabeth Warren, who by the way, initially called,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.520]   remember, she was the first as a presidential candidate
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.760]   in 2020 called for the breakup of Google
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.400]   and the breakup of Facebook.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.440]   Then later, the next day she was asked,
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.000]   well, Apple II, and she said, and felt like almost,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   oh, yeah, yeah, Apple II.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.960]   No.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.760]   Today, she said,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   "Today's big tech companies have too much power
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.440]   over our economy, our society, and democracy.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.280]   But actually, she said that when she talked about breaking up
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.240]   in March, Ted Cruz said,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   "By almost any measure, the giant tech companies
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.640]   are larger, more powerful than standard oil was
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.360]   when it was broken up.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.040]   They're larger, more powerful than AT&T
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.920]   when it was broken up."
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.520]   And yet I have to point out, AT&T was one company.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.520]   Standard oil was one company.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.200]   If you say in aggregate, the tech sector has too much power.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.760]   That's a very different thing.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.560]   That's not the same thing as saying one company has too much power.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.480]   And I really don't think Apple's a monopoly in any sense of the word.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.360]   So this is almost a new way of thinking of what anti-trust means.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.000]   And I think you've got to be very careful because
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.600]   you can't look like you're punishing the tech sector
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.920]   because it was successful, or you're punishing Apple
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.520]   because it's valuable, or worse, you're punishing Apple
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.040]   because they stood up to the FBI when they wanted them to unlock that iPhone.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.440]   That would be an even worse optically.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.000]   Well, again, this is a bipartisan panel in every sense of the word.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.280]   Yeah, we get a little bit more than Ted Cruz and sit next to each other.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:05.520]   And Koutong to the FBI is not necessarily a democratic imperative at this point.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.520]   Yeah, I have to point out Ted Cruz is there because of bias against conservatives.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.400]   He's not there because of privacy violations.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.080]   He's there because he says, "Twitter and Facebook are biased against our political party,"
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.400]   which is not the perfect.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.320]   Well, this is going to be part of the conversations moving forward.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.840]   Again, these panels are supposed to be mostly anti-trust.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.360]   There are going to be other more partisan actions against Google and Twitter and Facebook
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:42.400]   against the perceived attempt to silence conservative voices.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.640]   This is another issue where there is huge bipartisan support,
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.920]   but for opposite reasons, Google, excuse me, the conservatives want to get after Facebook
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.000]   and Twitter and Google because they believe that conservative voices are being censored and silenced.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.920]   Liberal side of the fence wants to go after them because they feel as though they're not doing enough
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.120]   to tamp down white supremacist speech and hate speech and all that other sort of stuff.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.600]   Yeah, that's just pointing out that this has nothing to do with antitrust for at least some of them.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.560]   The other thing is traditionally, anti-trust is about unfair price competition.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.600]   In the United States, we look at is pricing that hurts consumers.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.440]   The problem you have is Google's giving away services.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.880]   Most of it's services for free.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.920]   Facebook's giving away all of its services for free.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.800]   So what's the pricing that's hurting consumers?
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.200]   So what this is all going to require, I think, is a regi--
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.160]   I don't know if really what we should be talking is anti-trust here.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.840]   Maybe privacy concerns.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.440]   That's legitimate, Laurie.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.480]   Well, I think privacy concerns is a completely different conversation that has been had and should
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.720]   be continued to be had. In this particular case, though, 100 million years ago when I was still in
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:04.560]   college and the internet was just starting. I remember having discussions about how right now,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   at the time, the internet is this sort of wild west. It's the beginning of radio.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.160]   It's the beginning of television. There's no regulations at the time that there was nothing.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.920]   So we are now today looking at what that looks like when we've had this sort of open
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.840]   entertainment and media source that hasn't been regulated yet.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   And now it's grown to the point where it needs some kind of checks and balances.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:38.000]   And it's so big. It got so big that I can imagine that where do you start?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.760]   Do you call it anti-trust? Do you create brand new laws, which I think is probably the best thing to
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.560]   do but might be the most difficult to do? Brand new laws for tech because the same sort of
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   standard stone apply and shouldn't apply to technology. To me, this is a long time coming,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.000]   and I'm surprised that it hasn't happened sooner.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.760]   Yeah. I'm surprised.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.120]   But you say that Google gives things away for free, right? But the price is privacy.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:16.240]   So your point, Laurie, that this is huge, right? Because Google's taking your information. Yes,
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.080]   they're trading you their services and harvesting your information. Facebook's doing the same thing.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:29.040]   Apple's taking a different approach. So I think the Federal Trade Commission should be looking
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   deeper than just the direct monetary relationship between consumer and Google and consumer and
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.680]   Facebook. You've got to look at the whole picture and where that money is actually being made and why.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:48.960]   And to your point, Laurie, hopefully new laws get made that help regulate some of this stuff.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:55.120]   Well, it's a white map. Anti-trust is just part of this. And not only are they looking at
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.040]   how is this affecting consumer prices, but they're also looking at how does this affect markets.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   The first big hearing a few weeks ago was part of it was a coalition of local news producers,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.520]   like local newspapers and such, essentially saying that they don't have the ability to really
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:20.080]   negotiate against Google and Facebook for the amount of money that they get from ads.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:26.560]   They wanted to get sort of a waiver so they could create sort of a collective negotiation
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.840]   group so they could create a trust of their own so that they can demand better, more favorable
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.560]   positions and rates from Google and Facebook. So this is not just going to be about the question,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   how does this affect how much money people consumers have to pay for
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:50.080]   going to affect if a group of developers, if a group of service providers want to get together
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.440]   and say, here is how Apple's policies are limiting what we can do for our customers and the products
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.920]   that we can do and produce and why is Apple allowed to
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.400]   bend these rules for their own interests, but we can't bend them for our interests.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.480]   That sort of thing is going to come up. Now the need for more regulation is also going to be
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.360]   very, very important, but it is a separate issue. And it's not one that I like Elizabeth Warren for
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   so many reasons. I don't necessarily agree with the if you're a big, big, big company that means
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.400]   that it is in consumers best interest that you be broken up into smaller companies.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:33.200]   Because if you think about Google as we often say, as I often say, it really is a transaction,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.680]   either you're okay with a transaction that happens when you use Google Maps, Google Search,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.720]   Google Docs, all these other Google Apps and services, then great, go ahead and do it. If you
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.520]   don't, then you should not be participating in this sort of stuff. But the fact of the matter is,
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.120]   if they do break up Google, the fact is that all these really wonderful services that Google
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.200]   makes no money off of and doesn't really get as much content from as you might think. If these
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.560]   work all disappear, because it's all being funded by Google Ads, and now Google Ads is going to be
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   a totally separate company that can't necessarily prop up all of these free products, it's hard to
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.320]   really look at how much good has been done by the virtue of the fact that there is this thing
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:22.400]   called Google Maps out there. I use Google Research all the time where I just want to,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.120]   I need to become less dumb on a topic that I know nothing about, and I don't want to just look for
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.080]   like BuzzFeed articles about it. I need to get to original academic research on it. You can go to
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.880]   a Google Search page that is only for academic papers and has no ads on it whatsoever. Those
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.520]   are the sort of things that tend to go away. So that's why it's just a complicated issue.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.440]   It's not as simple as, but Google is huge and powerful. Facebook is huge and powerful.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.960]   Apple is huge and powerful. They need to break up their hardware and their software and their
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.760]   operating systems and their services businesses into separate units that can't interact with each
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.680]   other. I think that is in the long run worse for consumers than it would be better for industries.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:07.040]   Well, I agree it's complicated. I doubt very much Congress has, in fact,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.000]   Philip Elmer DeWitt, when he writes about it, says, "I wonder who on the committee can tell
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.720]   the difference between Apple, Google, Facebook." The good news is that when Elizabeth Warren proposed,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.920]   like Breaking You said, "We must break up Google." That wasn't done from her Senate account. This was
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.480]   done from her campaign account. So this is-- So this is-- Measure. It's good. It's grandstanding.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   I'm sure there's grandstanding going on right now in the meeting room.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:43.840]   I can't wait for the time when the people that sit on these panels actually understand technology
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.120]   and ask the right questions and actually are able to understand the answers and when the
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.280]   answers don't make sense, they can actually say, "Wait a minute. You didn't answer my question.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.440]   Answer my question." Because right now-- I watch these things in this--
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.480]   I think that's really interesting because when we went all through all this in the '90s, we were
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.520]   dealing with legislators and legislative aides who did not grow up with the internet, so they had
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.520]   no idea what they were regulating. Right now, though, we have plenty and plenty of people in
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.000]   Congress who did grow up with the internet, and they have assistants who grew up with the internet
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.920]   and maybe even grew up with mobile wife-- with a mobile internet. So even if specific congressmen
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.400]   are not as on the ball, they're being advised by people who are more on the ball and hopefully
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.280]   understand how bad, gutting something like Section 230 of the Communications
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.480]   Decency Act would be. So my hopes are higher than they would normally be when I hear that,
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.840]   "Oh, thank goodness. Congress is considering regulating technology."
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.760]   I feel like there's been a little schooling, too, from the public, and that you can't just
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:57.440]   slide on this thing as much as you might have. It's very-- look, no, everyone understands. It's
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.120]   very complicated, and it's subtle in a way. I don't know if Congress or the laws are sufficiently
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:11.920]   sophisticated to solve, but these hearings seem to advance nothing. But I guess it's a start.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.160]   We're going to take a break, and we come back. There is Mac News. There is Apple News. There's
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:22.000]   lots to talk about, but first, a word from our sponsor, Dave, before the show we were talking about
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.720]   Mongols. I averred that I think the time will soon come when we don't see Type A,
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.240]   USB anymore. You said, "Yeah, but what about printers?"
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:40.080]   I use a wireless printer, and I bet there's a USB connection on there. I don't know. I use an
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.920]   Epson Eco Tank printer. They are fabulous all-in-one wireless printers, but my favorite feature of
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.680]   the Epson Eco Tank printers is you can kiss expensive cartridges goodbye. They're inkjet
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:59.520]   printers that don't use inkjet cartridges. They're all-in-one super tankers that come with a lot of ink,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.480]   a ridiculous amount of ink in the box, enough to print thousands of pages. In fact, you're going
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.520]   to get up to two years of ink in the box, and with each future replacement, it bottle inks
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.360]   at another two years. So when you go to the store in 2021, actually, a couple of things you're
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.320]   going to like about it. When you go to the store-- is that Shaq? When you go to the store in 2021,
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.000]   two years from now, you're going to say, "Wow, this is a lot less expensive, too." And then you're
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.880]   going to get another two years of ink. You're not going to run out of ink. That is the deal with
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.920]   super-sized, easy-to-fill ink tankers. Eco Tank printers mean fewer trips to the store,
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.160]   less frustration for you. Eco Tank printers are changing the way people print. Get the compact

[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:53.920]   We just love them. Dave Hamilton is here from the Mac Observer. It's great to have you Dave
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   Andy Inako from Chicago, I'm sorry, Boston Public Radio, and Lori Gill from iMore.com,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:08.480]   where she is the managing editor. Update on the Zoom web server. Actually, I think there's an update
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:14.880]   on the update. We talked about it last week. Zoom, which is that teleconferencing software
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:21.920]   that you install. Then, like most people, you probably uninstalled after the conference was over.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:29.840]   If you did, what you didn't know is that they left a secret web server on your system.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:37.040]   Apple has pushed a silent Mac update to remove the Zoom web server, because it turns out,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.480]   since even though you didn't have the Zoom software on there, since that web server was sitting there,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.000]   if somebody sent you an invitation, they could actually turn on your camera and get you in a
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.920]   conference without your knowledge. Zoom has also done an update, although the first Zoom update,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.280]   I'm sorry, the first Apple update maybe didn't do enough because it's pushed another update.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   That's the latest. Apple has pushed another automatic Mac software update to, I guess,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.920]   their additional Zoom-related vulnerabilities.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:19.040]   Everybody's muted. No, just nobody's talking. No, no, everybody was muted.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:28.320]   Carson turned you all off. Let Dave take this one. I want to get Dave in here more.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:37.680]   Yeah, so interesting. I used it this morning for a web conference with a company. That's the thing,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.960]   is it super popular, and it works really well. I think that is the reason their engineers
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.520]   originally created this web server. They wanted to give this seamless, fluid customer experience,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:57.280]   and their engineers said, "I know how to do that." They didn't think two steps beyond that,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.600]   like, "Hey, maybe somebody could exploit this." But the same could be said about SMTP,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.280]   the engine that's used to send email. If the people knew about spam when they created it,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:14.640]   they might not have created the same engine. I get it. Where the issue comes in is their response
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.840]   last week, where they... Jean-Louis Gasey, who was the president of Apple France for a while,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.800]   has this great concept called the two-tokens concept of customer service. He says, "When a
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.360]   customer brings you a problem, there are two tokens on the table. One says, 'It's nothing.'
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.640]   The other says, 'It's awful.' And you get to pick up first. Whichever one you pick up,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.680]   your customer picks up the other you force them to." Zoom came out and said, "It's nothing."
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:46.640]   Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not a good idea, because the customer then must. By the customer,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:53.200]   we mean all the rest of us got to pick up the "It's awful" token. They learned their lesson,
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.680]   I think. But do they recover PRW's from this? Actually, I think they do it.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.120]   I think they did. If somebody asked you on a Zoom conference this morning, I think it's
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.720]   already fine. They're already okay. I was wondering. I think companies are so tied into it that
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.640]   it's too hard for them to find another conferencing solution, and so they just use it.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:17.840]   Yeah. It was a potential exploit. I don't think we heard of anyone using it, although there's no
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:25.200]   reason people couldn't have. It's shut down, and it all happened very quickly, and Apple's fixes for
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:33.600]   it are probably credited to Zoom by many, many non-techy people. Because I mentioned it on the
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.960]   call, because I was five minutes later, something, and they're like, "Why were you late?" I'm like,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.040]   "Well, you're using Zoom." I had to go and get it again.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.920]   Deeter Bone says exactly this in the Verge article. "The core issue stems from a change Zoom made
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.600]   to its software to work around a security update Apple made to Safari." You probably noticed this,
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.200]   Safari was recently updated in such a way that it required user approval to open a third-party
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.840]   app every time, and Zoom didn't want to have users having to deal with that extra click.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.360]   So they installed the web server that listened for calls to open up Zoom conferences,
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:16.160]   and combined for that the fact that it was common and easy for Zoom users to have their
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.640]   default set to have video on when joining a call, that's when the maliciousness began. Zoom has
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.320]   backed down. They changed their attitude. They said, "Yeah, we're going to fix it."
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.400]   Apple did push a second fix out today, but these silent patches, you don't have to do anything,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.120]   right? Do you see them? I haven't seen them. No, I don't. I think they're just... I'm sorry, go
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:46.320]   ahead, Laurie. I was just going to agree with you. Yeah, but they just simply happen. When there
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.120]   this important security updates, they just simply happen. You don't have the option of turning
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.800]   them down. I think that's good. I like that. And they happen without your interaction even.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:00.560]   Yeah. This is a really good example of sometimes when Apple does something that's very,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   very good and very, very positive, such as creating all the new security
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.200]   enhancements in the latest versions of Mac OS. Sometimes when you take this idea that is
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.480]   brilliant inside one infinite loop or inside the spaceship campus and you put it out in the wild,
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:22.400]   it becomes... People don't see the increased security. All they see is, "Why is this app asking
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.720]   me for permission to do something that every computer should just be able to do on its own?"
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.320]   And then the complaints... One complaint that I've been hearing from a lot of developers was
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.400]   if a user's Dropbox folder and other certain kinds of folders, they're in a certain place
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.640]   unless the user changes the default. So this app should be able to find the Dropbox folder and
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.840]   sync to something very, very easily without forcing the user to go through dialogue boxes or stuff
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:55.680]   like that. But then there was a change so that now you have to actually ask for permission to use
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:03.200]   to go outside of your box and actually find and locate the Dropbox folder. You have to ask the
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.800]   user, "Please locate my Dropbox folder for me." And from the user's point of view, suddenly the
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.080]   developer of this graphics app is an idiot who thinks, "You know where it is. You've always known
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.200]   where it is. Why do I have to suddenly point at the Dropbox folder for you?" And they really can't
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:27.040]   say, "Apple is making us do that." So sometimes to try to keep your customers happy, you find yourself,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.600]   again, if you're inside this conference room, not knowing how badly this will go once this is
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:38.160]   exposed to non-air conditioned air, how can we get around this so that we're not inconvenienced
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.080]   our customers? I know let's leave a persistent web server on the computer at all times that they
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.680]   never know about. And so this is not so much of them being idiots so much as they're wanting to make
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.040]   their customers happy but not thinking the requisite number of steps ahead, not flipping to the end of
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.880]   the book to see what happens after they do this thing. Turns out that there were others white
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.120]   labeling zooms technology including Ring Central, one of our former sponsors in Joomoo, Z-H-U-M-U,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.640]   and that's what Apple's doing. These are white label versions of the zoom technology. So Apple's
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.600]   now removing those as well. To answer your question before Leo, whether these get installed
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.920]   automatically or not, I think they do no matter what. But if you go into system preferences,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.280]   software update, there's an advanced button in the lower right with three dots which means there's
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:35.360]   more to it. If you click that at the bottom of the list, at least in Mojave, is install system data
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.960]   files and security updates. I recommend leaving that checked. So you could uncheck that if you
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:46.480]   wanted to. You could uncheck it for sure. Whether or not that would have avoided the zoom update from
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.640]   coming, I have no idea, right? But I'm going to say leave that checked. That makes sense. And then
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.120]   there are people like you, Dave, you're working in there. Maybe you're using Pro Tools on a Mac,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.080]   and you don't want to affect the stability of a system. And so you're afraid that in the middle
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.240]   of a recording session Apple could push something. So there are people who would turn that off,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.360]   of course. But in the normal course of events, leave it on. I recommend leave it on. Yeah.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:16.800]   Let's see. What else is going on in the world of Macintosh? This is a rumor. I don't know.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.600]   Well, you can tell me if it's credible. This comes from Tom's hardware.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.800]   Apparently, actually, originally came from Digitimes, Apple is killing its AR glasses.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:37.200]   Due to alleged technical problems, the port came from Digitimes, which as Tom's hardware
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:43.040]   points out has a mixed track record. In fact, Ming-Chi Kuo in March said that supply sources
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.600]   confirmed Apple may produce those glasses as soon as the end of 2019. But Digitimes is also a supply
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.080]   chain rumor mill. What do we know about this? Is this a permanent issue? Is Apple giving up on
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.480]   AR? Remember that Tim Cook was saying AR at every single analyst call, right, Lori?
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.040]   Every time over and over. And he stopped. He did not mention it at all in the last analyst call,
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:12.000]   right? He didn't mention it at all at the last analyst call. I don't know how much credit I would
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.720]   put to this particular rumor, though. There's just a rumor we should say Apple said nothing.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.080]   Right. There's something to be said for. The technology isn't there yet.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.360]   Right. So if Apple has done enough research and development to realize that right now, today,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.200]   they can't make the AR glasses that they want to make, they're going to shelve it and they're
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.120]   going to wait until the technology does exist. And then they're going to make it. It doesn't
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   mean that there's a problem with design inside Apple. It means that how long have we been hearing
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:49.840]   about an Apple TV, not the Apple TV box, but this television set that Apple was supposedly making
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.040]   15 years ago that we're talking about it and it still hasn't happened, the Apple car.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.280]   These are the companies out there doing all this research to try to figure out whether or not they
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   can actually do this. And there might come a point where they decide right now, the technology doesn't
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.480]   exist for us to do this. So we're going to shelve it until it does. And that makes a lot of sense.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.040]   I think all companies do things like that. So I don't think it's scrapped. I think that if it's
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.080]   at all, it's just being shelved until there's a little more advancement in what we can do.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:30.400]   Yeah. I think that I agree 100%. I think that for one, Apple does have a very successful AR
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.800]   consumer device and it's called the iPhone. That's all we've been seeing in the past two or three
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.280]   years. It's an interface to augmented reality that consumers are willing to use and willing to
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.840]   introduce into their lives. And you can do some really nice, really, really effective
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   tools, things with it, not just things like aiding maps, not just doing games. But
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.200]   do you know that as part of the 50th anniversary of the moon landings,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.520]   the Smithsonian has an actual 3D model of the Apollo 11 command module that you could just
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.960]   put it right on the desk and just zoom around and just take an absolute tour through. So these
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:14.720]   phones are really the only way you can do augmented reality on a consumer level. If you want to do
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:23.280]   it on a business level, if you want to do it for consulting, you can have something like Google
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.800]   Glass, which is being manufactured and sold. You can have something like Microsoft's product,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.880]   which again is being manufactured and sold. It's a really kind of goofy looking piece of headwear
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.360]   that you wear because you are working in an architecture firm and you absolutely need to
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.680]   be able to show offs. You do walk throughs of certain properties or you need to be able to teach
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   somebody how to fix a certain aircraft component in a way that's more effective than having a
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.600]   three ring binder next to an engine. But the problem with augmented reality and the reason why
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:03.440]   I am prejudiced to believe the report that Apple is backing away from immediate plans is that
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:11.760]   I haven't seen a single technology that would provide augmented reality in a way that people
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.640]   would expect for it to work, where you look around and there are things in your field of vision that
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:25.040]   aren't actually really there. I don't know if it could be incorporated in a non goofy looking device
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.600]   that consumers would simply buy, the way they would buy AirPods, the way that they would buy
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:37.840]   iPhones. Secondly, there's the second huge problem is that people like us who wear glasses have a
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:44.000]   huge, huge advantage over people who don't in that I can buy a pair of like Bose headphones that are
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.680]   built into eyeglass frames and be walking around all the time with headphones on without appearing
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.520]   as I'm wearing headphones. Whereas if you don't wear glasses naturally, you are forced to basically
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.960]   put something on your face, you wouldn't normally have on your face. The lenses are not doing anything
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.600]   useful for correcting your vision. They're just there to put more stuff in front of your face.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:11.360]   Are you going to get people to put something on their faces apart from sports glasses, apart from
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.400]   sunglasses, just to get augmented reality features? So I'm not saying that this breakthrough hasn't
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.760]   happened. It's just that I haven't seen it anywhere. So I'd be given that Apple would not want to be
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.240]   the company that would want to make a goggles sort of thing that wouldn't they don't want to make a
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.680]   a pair of like swim goggles that has a cable to a pod they have to wear on your hip for cooling
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:37.680]   and for processing. I just wasn't able to see how Apple would be able to manufacture something
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.920]   that would be very, very Apple like. Yeah, I just I don't think anybody will ever be
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.080]   a hold on a second. I just got a message. I don't think anybody will ever be doing.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:52.560]   Oh, these are very annoying. Okay. So we have a couple of these in house.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:00.000]   This one is who makes these? Music's blade is a views explained. And then there's another
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   company that in fact, Anthony went down to San Francisco. He said, Hey, you want to go down to
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.040]   San Francisco get fitted for some AR glasses tomorrow? I said, that sounds incredibly annoying.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.640]   No, I do not. He went down. So he is yours are coming this week, I think, right? Tomorrow he's
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:20.720]   getting them. So we're going to do some reviews on these. But Jason Howell had these
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.040]   music for a while. He said, No, I can't do it anymore. Because you're look, what first of all,
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.640]   what do I look like? Do I look good? Or everson? You don't look bad.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.920]   I'm great. So I was wearing him this morning and I thought, what do you do? The eye doctor,
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.720]   do you get your pupils dilated? Why are you wearing these weird? Oh, he just asked me if I
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:46.000]   want to coffee. That's the other problem. I am talking to you. And like this color message,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.160]   this is a heads up display, not like the Google glass where it was over your eyebrow.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.120]   So while I'm looking out, I see the world that looks like I'm maybe a little bit wearing sunglasses,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.560]   but this is projecting onto the back of the screen messages and notifications. If I tap this,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.920]   I can see the weather forecast. I can see other things I can see Anthony's messages.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:15.040]   Let's see. Here's home. It's July 16th. It's 1.11 PM. I could see cache data, user data. I don't
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.000]   know why. Maybe I'm on some sort of weird settings thing. This has its own processor,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.480]   its own memory. What was your battery life like, Anthony? Did you get through the day with this thing?
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.280]   I was trying to find out. I was very good. Probably not. I'm at 50% now. You started wearing them
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:35.520]   what time? This morning. So yeah, it won't get through the full day. Now, admittedly, we're at the
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:43.200]   Atari VCS stage of this. This is very early days of the technology. But I could see if Tim Cook,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.880]   you know, Johnny said, "Hey, before I leave, I'd like to show you something." And Tim Cook
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:55.920]   comes in and puts these on. I could see him saying, "Not today, Johnny. Not today." It's just there.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.240]   It is very early days yet. I mean, it's there. I think there'll be people who will want this,
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:07.680]   I guess. I wouldn't. I don't know. And Laurie, do you think I'm a good-looking fella in these?
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:15.120]   Or if I walked up to you at a sick burn concert and I just said, "Hey, man, you're so good. Can I buy
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:25.680]   you a cup of coffee? Would you reject me out of hand?" The glasses are weird looking. They definitely,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:33.440]   those ones, the one you're wearing, they look like a guy who's trying to show everybody how
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:40.080]   cool he is. His glasses aren't cool enough to really make that work. Definitely when it comes to
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:47.600]   design, that the AR glasses are just failing 100%. But they have to be, because they have to contain
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.440]   batteries and there's a PC in here and there's all this stuff. To me, I look like I'd be more likely
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.720]   to come up to you and say, "No, is it time on Splockets when we dance?"
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.840]   No, no. This isn't a hidden camera. I'm not really thinking video-
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.000]   I'm not recording you. Don't pay no attention to my swiping.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.280]   Think about this. Wearables had been around watches. Smart watches had been around for a while
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:19.680]   before Apple finally jumped into the smartwatch industry. What did they do? They came out
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.400]   presenting it to you as this well-designed luxury piece. I think AR glasses could be the same thing.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:32.880]   Yeah, maybe. To me, there's still an issue with the thing popping up in front of your eyes. It's a
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:40.480]   little annoying. Oh, there's one other thing. These are $700. So you're paying a price to be that guy.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.880]   And honestly, if you wear them, you are that guy. Anthony?
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.520]   That guy.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:55.760]   You are that guy. Thank you for letting me wear those. But again, if I got an Atari VCS and I was
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.480]   playing pitfall with my little plastic joystick and I said, "Some day these games are going to be so
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.720]   immersive, you'll think you're living in them." You said, "Yeah, but not today, buddy." We're at the
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.160]   early days. I don't know whether to credit this rumor or not.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.200]   I think that right now, mobile AR is kind of like where smartphones were before mobile broadband.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:26.160]   Okay, it's very, very nice. I'd have to boy have a really good reason to have a full pocket-sized
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.320]   computer on me at all times. But once we get the secret sauce of, "Well, what if you could actually
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.800]   browse the web and actually do things on the internet wherever you are and get your email and
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.400]   not have to relay it through a text messaging portal or something like that?" That's the secret
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.720]   sauce that made it all work. We were waiting for the secret sauce technology to make actual
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.480]   real consumer mobile AR work.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.800]   Robert Mike in the chair says, "Not only are you look like Bono."
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:02.240]   The difference is, every time I snap my fingers, I'm not Bono. If I were Bono, no one would say
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:08.080]   anything. Yeah, that's right. Well, maybe the rumor comes from Apple had to shelve it until they
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:14.400]   could hire Johnny's design company to dream it up. Maybe not. I think that we remember how
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:20.240]   all the mockery with the Google Glass, it hasn't gone away. This has the same issues that Google
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:27.200]   Glass had. Maybe it'll be a hearable. Maybe Apple's going to do something with the AirPods instead.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:34.080]   I really seriously think that the breakthrough is really going to be an even more compact version
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:40.160]   of the AirPods because the ability to simply have a conversation with Slomo and not only ask
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   the questions and get information back that you need, but the ability for it to click a button
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.800]   and say, "By the way, you are allowed to interrupt me and actually say things." Now,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:56.560]   imagine all of that plus something the size of a camera the size of a ballpoint pen that you have
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.360]   in your front pocket that faces forward so it can feed video to your phone so we can say,
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.400]   "Oh, by the way." And in your piece says, "Oh, by the way, I recognized that person. You met her
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:14.320]   at a conference two years ago. Her name is Shelley. She works for Obama. And the last time you emailed,
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:20.080]   you talked about this. Like, "Shallie, how are you still with Obama?" There's so many great
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:25.440]   things you could do without necessarily having actual screens in front of your eyes, so long
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.400]   as the device can see out, and so long as it can talk to you through your ears or even just through
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.320]   some discreet taps. How's the device going to see? Are you going to wear a funny hat?
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.840]   I'm saying, what if you have a device like the size of a pen where you just in your front
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.480]   pocket, right, exactly, and just with a lens popping up in the front? That's not at all a creepy
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:53.600]   feet. Oh, that's why. No, no, no. This is Jane from Anders' game. I want Jane from Anders' game,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:59.280]   but I want privacy first before somebody makes me Jane because if I don't have privacy first,
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.920]   Jane has to see everything. Jane has to join you in the bathroom. Otherwise, you don't have Jane.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:09.120]   Jane needs to know things that are only mine to know. That's right.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:17.520]   That's why that pen camera has a swivel lens that swivels all the way 180 degrees to face the
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.880]   cloth of your shirt if you need to. I'm sorry, and a little light. Pen cameras just not going to work.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.640]   Fine. Then I guess you don't want to be invited on my super mega party yacht when I make a billion
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.920]   dollars off this idea. Good. I guess your band does not want to be paid a half a million dollars to
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.680]   pay to play at my IPO party. My name is not Jane. I don't work at Obama. I don't know who the
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.480]   hell you are and why is there a camera sticking out of your pocket? And the next time I see you,
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:53.200]   like my earpiece will say, oh, her name is Laurie Gill. She does not own three mansions because
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.520]   you offered her a spot on the ground floor of your business as she made fun of you instead.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:02.080]   Yes. Dream on and not code. Dream on. Please don't be mean to her. She really regrets it.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.640]   I showed it. I brought to you by LastPass. I use LastPass. You should use LastPass. In fact,
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   I just locked myself out of my Firefox because I use LastPass. And I really a strong believer in
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:19.440]   not only two factor authentication, but using a dongle for two factor authentication. This
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:26.400]   is a Yubiki. Unfortunately, I forgot my Yubiki Type C to Type A adapter in this computer,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:31.760]   this silly Windows computer doesn't have any Type C adapters. So I couldn't open up Firefox.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:37.120]   But that's kind of what you want, right? You don't want any way you can sneakily get around
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.480]   your two factor authentication because LastPass has all your information. And by the way,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.080]   I trust LastPass so much that I put my driver's license, my social security numbers,
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:55.360]   my passport images. LastPass is the last password vault you'll ever need. It's a vault
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.880]   that uses super strong encryption. In fact, they do everything right not just strong
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:13.520]   encryption, but they use PBK DF2 to make it impossible or at least very, very difficult to brute force
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.640]   your password. I have my PBK DF2 set to I think 100,000 iterations. That means every single time a
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.440]   bad guy tries a password for brute force, he has to go through 100,000 iterations before he can do
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:31.200]   the next password and the next one. It's virtually impossible. It's little things like that. LastPass
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:36.720]   does it right. Your LastPass vault is only decrypted on device, never anywhere else, including the
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:42.880]   LastPass servers. And they have apps for every browser, every device. It's the first thing I
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.120]   install when I get a new phone and I get a new browser when I get a new computer, I put LastPass
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:52.880]   on it. Because all I have to do is remember my master password and have my Yuba key or whatever
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:49:00.000]   two factor you want to use. And then I can get into every other password. LastPass has just
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.800]   done something very exciting for us. We use LastPass Enterprise. Every business should be using LastPass
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   because really the weak link in your business is the employees. They have the passwords to your
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:16.240]   bank account, to your bookkeeping system, to your servers, to everything. And that means that's a
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:21.520]   vulnerability with LastPass. They can get access to those services, those websites, that information
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.920]   without actually having a password. You can easily change it, you can completely control it.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.280]   And with LastPass's new business lineup, this has gotten even better. This is brand new.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:38.400]   LastPass Enterprise now includes single sign-on technology. And this is always the problem is,
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.840]   how do we balance security with convenience? You can do it wrong like Zoom did or you could do
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:51.200]   it right like LastPass does. Single sign-on technology, there's more than 1200 now pre-integrated apps.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.720]   So in addition to its existing market leading password management capability, LastPass Enterprise
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:03.920]   lets your employees log on simply to all 1200 plus of those apps. They manage access for every
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:10.080]   entry point with one solution. Apps that are covered by SSO, it's easy, it's fast. If they're
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.840]   not, it's the old-fashioned, but still very successful way of doing a password and two-factor.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.560]   They go beyond even two-factor now with MFA, multi-factor authentication. They're using
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:26.640]   biometrics. They're using other factors like geolocation. LastPass MFA ensures only the right
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:31.920]   users are accessing the right data at the right time. Again, without adding complexity or inconvenience
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.480]   to your users, but they're locking down the security. That's the key. LastPass really knows
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:40.960]   what they're doing with this. Finally, there's LastPass Identity. This is a combination of the
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:47.280]   LastPass Enterprise features and the new LastPass MFA features. As an IT guy or security guy, you're
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.200]   going to love this with a holistic view of end user activity from a single dashboard,
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:58.240]   passwords, authentication, all the apps in use, single sign-on, password management, adaptive
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:04.560]   authentication. These are state-of-the-art tools, now yours from LastPass. LastPass Identity,
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:14.000]   where you'll get granular control plus frictionless access. It's the holy grail of password management.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.320]   We love LastPass. I've been using it for as long as it's been around, I think, almost 10 years.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.760]   We use it, of course, at work. We offer it as a benefit to all our employees because I want them
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.480]   to be safe at home to LastPass, bridging the gap between access and authentication
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:34.960]   simply and securely manage identity. That's really what it's all about. 13 and a half million people
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.640]   use LastPass. They're loving it and trusting it. Tens of thousands of businesses visit lastpass.com/twit.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:47.840]   Find out how they can help you. Thank you, LastPass. LastPass.com/twit. Can I mention
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:59.360]   what we're doing with LastPass in October? No? Okay. Stay tuned. I'm excited, but I will wait.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:07.920]   We'll tell you about it a little bit. I love, I have to say, I've said it before, I love my 2018
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:14.400]   MacBook Air. Even though it's got the butterfly 3 keyboard, I find it usable enough. I love it
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.320]   that it doesn't have a touch bar, but it does have fingerprint ID. It's got a retina screen.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.640]   It's good enough fast enough, not super fast, but fast enough to do all the things I want to do.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:31.520]   Danny Sabato over there and I'm more as a surprise for us. The new 2019 MacBook Air
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.320]   is slower at least one respect than last year's. Laura, you want to talk about this?
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:47.600]   Yes. The best that I think we can understand from this is that
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:55.680]   for the sake of getting the price down, it's possible that Apple put in a
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:05.680]   lower S-T to just, if you read the information on the percentage difference,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.160]   it's not very much. It's not very much. It's a price point down. They might have just kind of...
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.120]   It's still fast. Let's put it that way, but it is 35% slower, which I think is more than
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:24.480]   a little bit slower. This is using the Blackmagic Disc Speed Test. It comes from Konsamac.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.440]   Now remember, there isn't an SSD in these MacBook Airs. This is soldered in memory and the T2 chip
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:38.880]   uses the software controller. But it is conceivable that they put different memory in their cheaper
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:50.560]   memory in there to reduce the price. I think the idea being that there's an exchange of price
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:56.320]   for speed, because most people, the MacBook Air is not their heavy machine. It's kind of intended
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:02.000]   to be used as sort of their light browsing the internet kind of machine. It doesn't necessarily
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:12.640]   need that faster processor speed or that faster usability. If there's a reason why,
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   it would be, let's drop the price of the MacBook Air because everybody complained about how
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:22.240]   expensive it was when it first came out. At the same time, let's use a slightly cheaper chip so
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:28.480]   that we can afford this kind of exchange. Most people wouldn't notice it. I really do believe
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:33.440]   that most people wouldn't notice that change. The difference between writing a gigabyte a second
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:40.080]   versus 0.9 gigabytes a second is not going to make a big difference. Reading is a lot faster.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:47.440]   It's my old MacBook Air is 2 gigabytes per second. The newer MacBook Air is 1.3 gigabytes per second.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.120]   But that's gigabytes, not gigabits. You're reading one and a third gigabytes every second.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.880]   I can't think of a lot of applications where you need anything faster than that. So I think
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:02.320]   that's a reasonable place. They cut the price. With the CPU that's in there, I think you're going
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:08.080]   to, I have the same MacBook Air. I have the original OG 2018 MacBook Air. And like you,
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:16.240]   I love it. It's a great machine. But I see it hit CPU walls long before I see it ever hit
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:21.280]   disc-read walls. So yeah, I don't, I think this is actually a smart move on Apple's part.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:31.680]   One, it's a 1.6 gigahertz dual core i5 that's in there. I'm thinking it's a U part, but I don't
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:37.520]   know. Maybe it's a Y part. Apple's not real forthcoming in the tech specs on that. But to get 100 bucks
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.960]   off the price. Yeah. You know, it is a Y part. It's a Y part. That's the slower.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.120]   Well, in the original air. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess the real
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:51.520]   memorial here is don't buy the new one thinking you're going to get a faster one. If you already
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:56.720]   have a 2018, you're good. No need. Not that anybody would be crazy enough to do that.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:05.280]   The walkie talkie, speaking of flaws is being disabled. Does anybody, I used it, Lisa and I
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.680]   used it. I got the new watch. I was so excited. Got the new watch of us. We used it for about two
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:17.280]   days. And then she said, I'm not using the same text. You if I need you. Does anybody use walkie
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:25.840]   talkie? Anybody? So I was talking about this on the I'm more show. There are use cases where
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:34.720]   this could be really beneficial. Yes. Sorry. I was just making sure that you're muted. Yes.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.800]   I heard you every word. Okay. There are use cases where this can be very
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.360]   beneficial. And Georgia Dow was talking about how her and her husband and her kids use it every
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:50.400]   time they go out to the mall or to the store. Of course. They use it to communicate with each
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.120]   other when they go separately to do a little shopping. It's their quick and easy way to chat
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.960]   with each other. I am like you Leo that I tried it out at first with Renee and I've never used it
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:07.520]   since then. But I can see a very limited use case or for some people that have sort of picked it up
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.520]   and they're using it regularly that this is actually a really great feature for them that
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.720]   they've come to sort of enjoy and trust and think of it as like they're sort of helping
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:23.760]   helping friend. So I hope that Apple doesn't permanently take it away. I don't think they will.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   But because it doesn't seem to be used a whole lot, I could maybe imagine that they were like, well,
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:37.600]   there's this flaw. Let's just get rid of it. Yeah. They did say we've disabled the function
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:44.400]   as we quickly fix the issue. So the issue was that it could be used to eavesdrop on you. Okay,
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:50.000]   that's kind of an issue is a similar problem with the the FaceTime bug. Remember where somebody could
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.880]   create a group conversation without your knowledge. The walkie talkie app apparently would allow
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:04.400]   somebody to listen in on your phone or maybe your watch. I don't know. Must be a watch, right? So
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.560]   they rather than try to figure it out, they just say just as they did with the FaceTime bug,
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.240]   they disabled the feature until a fix can be made. But they did say they're going to quickly fix it.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:18.800]   I hope they do. Basically the same exploit that zoom felt prey to just handled differently.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:25.760]   Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. So good. You know, that's the right thing to do is fix it. And but yeah,
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:31.440]   I hope they I guess for those for for Georgia Dow, I guess I hope they fix it. That actually
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.040]   does make sense with kids because you don't necessarily but then that means every kid has to
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:44.640]   have an Apple watch. Well, it's it's probably got Georges. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's nice to have that
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.280]   feature for people who are going to take advantage of it, particularly families. I know a lot of
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   families that actually have like a little bag of FRS radios that's like really good modern walkie
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.960]   talkies exactly for that reason. Yeah. Because it's you can either like text message somebody
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.400]   and you're going through a network or and you don't know like how it's hooked, things are going
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:12.000]   to be or you can simply push a button on this this this walkie talk you got for for $400.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.080]   You get a ping. They know it's you and you're immediately talking to this person. So yeah,
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:20.720]   it's I'm glad that Apple is definitely on top of these things. You're isn't it great when you hear
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.920]   about this first from the company themselves rather than throwing away to do it from yeah,
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.160]   exactly from from Washington Post or somebody else. That's what we expect from Apple.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.280]   There are times when I would like to have instant communication. The problem is really
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.440]   that text messaging isn't really all that reliable. Even I messages isn't really
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:42.240]   all that reliable. Either somebody doesn't have the phone or sometimes going through a gateway
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:48.000]   from one carrier to another. It doesn't get through or can be delayed. So it isn't you know,
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.200]   or maybe just Lisa is ignoring me when I ask her when she's going to be home for dinner, but
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:58.560]   could be the recipient. That's right. But it'd be nice if I could say, hey,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.520]   when are you going to be home dinner is ready.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:09.040]   Apple TV plus coming soon. Yes, we think.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:16.400]   That's what they say. Yep. They got it. They got it up by August or September, don't they?
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.680]   Yeah, they certainly have to have it ready before the next iOS comes out,
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.160]   because if they miss this window of saying here is our new app for dealing with this service and
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.120]   they don't bundle it in with every single phone that ships every single brand new phone that ships,
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.880]   they will have missed a huge opportunity. All right, we're hearing budgets. This is for the
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:41.680]   C, which is the TV show where the future no one can see. $15 million in episode,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:48.240]   which is pretty stunning. That's Game of Thrones season eight money. I mean, that's big bucks.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:54.800]   And I talked to somebody who worked on the set of one of the other Apple shows who said, yeah,
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.120]   they were never price conscious. They had money to burn. They were glad to spend the money. So,
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:07.920]   I guess. That's the right way they have to do it, right? I mean, if they want to step in as a
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:14.320]   major player, they have to act like a major player and then some, right? Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.560]   Tim Cook and Eddie Q are at the Big Sun Valley Media Conference. Here's a picture of them
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:27.680]   in their sporty collared shirts. Tim's wearing a polo shirt. Eddie looks like he's wearing a
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.880]   Tommy Bahama. This is going on right now in Sun Valley, Idaho technology and media moguls gather.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.880]   This is the eighth year in a row, Tim and Eddie have been at the conference.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:46.480]   The other big joining them, by the way, it's in Sun Valley are General Motors CEO, Comcast CEO,
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, Cheryl Sandberg, C O O of Facebook, and Uber CEO, Derek Kosroshahi.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:01.600]   It's a big, big deal is Sun Valley Conference. The other big rumor that we've been hearing
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.280]   is that iOS 12.4 will come out and when it does so will the Apple card and some say this is the week.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:17.120]   It's possible. We thought Apple card was going to be out when the app store went down. A lot of
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:24.560]   us were like, is it? The app store was the Apple card. Yeah. Or the, sorry, the Apple's retail store.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.480]   Yeah. Right. Yeah. Like they were trying to stick it in there, but nothing. It was no change.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.240]   Anybody could see. You're going to get an Apple card, Lori.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:41.440]   Are you going to get an Apple card, Lori?
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.120]   But let me push the walkie talkie button. Are you going to get an Apple card, Lori?
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:53.280]   Get in here. Go ahead. We need to walk you talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:58.960]   Yes. I will be gaming Apple card. I'm actually very excited about it. Yeah.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.480]   You were. I remember when we were talking about it. You were. How about you, Andy? Apple card,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:09.600]   a titanium Apple card saying Andrew and not go in the future. I would like to try it out.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.240]   I think that's more of a limitation of my credit rating than it would be for
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.680]   a desire to give anybody one of those, right? You just might not get a good interest rate.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.840]   Well, if they give it to me, that'll prove it.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.680]   I don't know. That's one of the things they said, though, is that they're going to be more generous
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:35.040]   in offering that card. I just want it because it's titanium. I could cut my meat with it.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:41.600]   It is cool. Have you seen one in person? No, I helped one. Yeah. I have. I probably,
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.200]   maybe I'm not supposed to. I won't say who's I held, but yeah. I held one as they bought me
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.960]   coffee or something. Oh, that's neat. Oh, that's neat. Yeah. Yeah. It's heavy.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:56.240]   Like it is. Oh, really? Exactly what you would expect. Yeah. It's more substantial than a credit
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:02.560]   card. So yeah. Yeah. I have a metal. I have a metal Amex card. I don't know, maybe because I've
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:10.880]   been a member of Amex since 1980. It was thicker than those. Okay. Yeah. But it had that same kind
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.480]   of half cut me with this. Yeah, you wouldn't cut me with the Apple one. It was, as you would
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:23.440]   expect, it was glorious to hold and it felt like, yeah, of course. There's a glow coming off of it.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.360]   This one has a number. It's etched into the metal, but it does have a number. Apple's does not. It
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.840]   just has a name, no signature field or anything, right? But there is a chip. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.720]   Annie, are they kicking you out? No, there are some kids that seem to think that they
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.680]   have access to this room, but they do not. Okay. We were going to be done in time. Don't worry.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.280]   Tell those kids Santa will be here in half an hour.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:55.360]   Yeah. I'll get one. I guess. I mean, I want to play with it. You don't have to use it. You could
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:02.000]   just have it put it on the wall, frame it. Was it when you have more open credit? What was it like?
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.360]   Yeah. Right. No, it's not. But well, hell it is. Is it? I got an 850 credit rating. Yeah.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:13.600]   What? Totally the thing. I know. You got it. That's as high as it gets. As high as it gets, man.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.920]   Yep. It's true. See, I thought that your, I thought your FICO score goes down a little bit.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:24.480]   If you have too much money, you can borrow. No, it's, it's the percentage you want a low percentage
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.760]   of borrowed money as compared to how much you could borrow because it shows responsibility or
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.880]   something. Yes. Yeah. It's always it like, yeah. Anyway, Dave Hamilton's responsibility.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.080]   That's always gone together in my book. Well, this is, this is, this is, this is, this does
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.720]   point out a really good opportunity for Apple to teach people about credit and teach people about
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:50.000]   how these things work. I mean, I was shocked the time I realized when I had a long conversation with
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.960]   like a friend who was a banker who said that, no, no, no, see, you don't understand the fact that you
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.880]   have always, you've always taken a philosophy that I'm not going to buy anything unless I can
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:04.160]   actually afford to buy it. And you paid, and you basically buy your cars for cash and you pay all
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.440]   your bills as soon as they come in, that establishes you're a terrible credit risk because you've never
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.640]   like borrowed $10,000 and then paid it back. And I'm like, you're joking.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:21.760]   Andy, the ways of high finance are mysterious to the likes of you and I.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:28.320]   I know I am a poor little country mouse, but we shall, we shall turn to brother David from now on
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:33.680]   by the deep insights. Yeah. Can you get cosign a bunch of stuff for me because
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:41.200]   yeah, there's a reason that it remains 850 and answering no to questions like that, I think is a
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:47.680]   big part of it. But yeah, I will get one. I like my Marriott points that I earned, so I'm not sure
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:53.920]   if I'll use it routinely, but I'll get one. I think they're going to have to do, it's an app, right?
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.760]   So the whole application process happens on your iPhone, doesn't it? That was my impression.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:03.040]   So they'll have to do either a system update. I think it's going to have to be an iOS update.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.520]   Yeah, yeah, I'm almost positive that you'll have to update your phone in order to access the
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.880]   new Apple card application that I believe will be in the wallet app.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.480]   Oh, I see. Oh, that makes sense. Finally, the wallet is actually a wallet.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:25.840]   All right. So I'll just keep looking. Now, here's a question somebody asked us on iOS today and we
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:32.080]   didn't know the answer. There's historical precedent for this. If you do decide to do the iOS 13
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:39.760]   public beta, will Apple push out the app on the public beta as well as an iOS 12.4? Or will you
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:49.520]   have to wait till September to get an Apple card? I feel probably everyone probably has to do it
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:55.200]   at the same time. Mike, Mike has thought that that had happened with an iOS 11 to 12 update that
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:00.400]   some people on the public beta didn't get a feature. I think it was ECG, the EKG feature of the watch
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.640]   because they were on the next generation and they have an update for that.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.640]   So if you think you want an Apple card, do not do the public beta of iOS 13 or at least preserve
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:16.960]   one device, I'm going to think you can't use. Could you use this the iPad to apply for the app?
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:25.040]   See, it's so many questions. So many questions. I would guess that you would have to have an
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:32.640]   iPhone because the importance of a cellular telephone number has become more and more important
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.840]   because people can move from place to place to place. But that as an identifier and as a means of
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.000]   contact with you remains the same. This is why so many different apps try very, very hard to get
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.080]   you to sign up for two factor authentication because if they have your phone number,
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   they basically have this basically the keys to the castle that will unlock all kinds of other
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.200]   information about you because it's constant from used to used to use. So I have a Yuba key instead
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.640]   of a phone text messaging. But yeah, there's so many advantages to the Apple card that yeah,
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.920]   although I'll happily like take that rejection letter.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.120]   On the off chance, I might get like a $250 by spending them.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.720]   So now we'll have to ask the question. Did you get the Apple invitation? Did you get the rejection
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.520]   letter? It's just Apple. Apple's breaking our hearts back all the time.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.960]   Airdrop was being used. This I thought was interesting. This is a story from a quartz.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:35.280]   Airdrop was being used by the Hong Kong protesters to pamphlet visitors from China.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.400]   Chinese visitors unable to, you know, they had to go through the Great Firewall of China even in
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.480]   Hong Kong. So when you arrive, in fact, they in the quartz story, they talked about arriving
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:53.200]   in Hong Kong and being bombarded via airdrop. Here this is Alice Su,
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:10:00.640]   arrived at TST station immediately bombarded with anti extradition bill flyers via airdrop
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.080]   and simplified Chinese. The fact that it's in simplified Chinese tells you it's aimed at
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.960]   mainland Chinese users. They don't use it in Hong Kong. And of course they've been
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:15.120]   blacked out as to what's going on in Hong Kong. So a very interesting choice of technologies for
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.880]   propaganda airdrop. Yeah, also pretty dangerous because they're probably they're going to have
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.560]   those people are going to have to pass back through a border at some point at which their
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.880]   phones can and will probably will be collected. And what happens when they see this when the
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.000]   officials at the border see this flyer or this this material on their phones that they didn't
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.200]   ask for? Maybe they're even not terribly where existed. So I'm worried about that.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.480]   That's a good point. I didn't think about it. You have to accept it though. You can't.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.360]   But you may accept it. Maybe you accepted something because you didn't know what was
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:53.360]   what was happening. And then you forgot to simply delete it. Or maybe there are forensic tools
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.120]   available to border control that can find the thing that got deleted. And now you're now you're
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.680]   talking about credit score is your social your social credit score is going down. And now you
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.920]   can't buy a train ticket to anywhere because you're no longer trustworthy.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.960]   Our pact is back. This was the software. In fact, the New York Times had a story about
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.120]   our pact, which is parental control software and a bunch of other parental control software that
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.200]   had been kicked from the Apple store a few months ago because they used MDM. That's the
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:32.160]   Apple mobile device managing certificate that allows well was intentionally intended originally
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:39.760]   for enterprises to allow them to control and snoop on employees iPhones. Apple in its original
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.320]   rules for the app store said you can't use MDM as a private company. They've changed those rules
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:56.960]   and put our pact back in. The new rules say that MDM is intended for enterprise or parental control
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:06.480]   apps. So it amazes me what MDM and VPN have been like the creative uses that app developers have
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:14.560]   found to sort of get around the limitations of iOS using MDM and VPN. It's like, I think this is
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:21.840]   a good use of of it is although Apple's initial. I think Apple's initial complaint still stands
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.600]   that it can be you know, MDM shouldn't be used by standard apps because you know, if you use it
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.080]   on employees phone, there's an implicit understanding that this is a company phone company will monitor
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   you. In fact, it's often explicit should be explicit if you're a company, but you're not
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.320]   required to make it explicit. I guess I mean, parents have the right to monitor what their kids
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.880]   are doing on their phone. But there's also the concern that our pact or any other company that's
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:51.760]   using MDM can also see that data. And I thought Apple's initial reasons for yanking it were genuine.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.480]   I didn't actually buy the New York Times contention that they pulled it because it was competition
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.880]   for Apple's own screen time technology. Well, you know, I didn't buy that either. I think.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.720]   But I think privacy thing, not a real thing now or.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.920]   It depends on how they're using the data, right? Or where where the data is flowing.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.160]   Maybe they've got maybe they've got a way of keeping it from going back to the developer.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.720]   Yeah, that would be good. Yeah.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.920]   This remember, it was also used by Facebook to spy on what with your permission, spy on how you
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.520]   used your phone with a quote VPN app that Facebook was offering. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Dave.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.160]   No, that that's exactly it is. I as long as we got to find out more about where the data is going
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.040]   and who gets to see it and all that stuff. Yeah. But like, you know, what one dot one or cloud
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:49.680]   flare with their one dot one dot one dot one app is doing like to use VPN as sort of the hack to
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.440]   to get into the network settings of your phone. That's awesome. It's so creative and effective.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.880]   Like it really works. Yeah. Yeah, actually, Steve Gibson was talking about a new.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:09.840]   I think a very smart policy that some people are advocating Firefox uses called DNS over HTTPS.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.040]   The problem, which is kind of what one dot does as well, the problem is the same thing.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:20.240]   Same thing is that when you're doing your DNS query, your internet service provider sees what
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.920]   sites you want to go to and records that and can sell it to marketers. In fact, often does.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.880]   So one dot, you put that on your smartphone or you, I guess you could use it on your computer as well,
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:37.600]   does an encrypted query to cloud flare and then on to the rest of the world so that your ISP can't
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:44.160]   see what you're doing. And that's and so in the same thing with HTTPS DNS, we talked about that
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.480]   last week on security now. I'm sure Steve will have more to say about that as well. This security
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.600]   now just around the corner, as a matter of fact. Let us pause and get your picks of the week.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:04.240]   And then we will let Andy get out of the library. I showed it a what I'm going to hang out here.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.160]   I'm just going to stand in the room. Let the kids in. That's what I should.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   Free comics, free magazines. Is it free? It's not free comic day today, is it?
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.960]   No, no, no, just in the library. Every day.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.240]   Comics got magazines. Every day is free comic day at the library.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.400]   Support your local library, kids.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.040]   Or should they brought to you by cap terra? Find the right tools
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.800]   to do your business. A lot of people use line of business software that's woefully out of date.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:36.640]   Internet Explorer 8 on Vista sound familiar to you? That is because the person or company who
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.920]   wrote that software is long gone. They haven't updated it, but your entire business runs on it.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.200]   I know how it is. I've seen this happen. You search for the category you need. There are 700
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.480]   categories, not just CRM, but IT project management, e-commerce link management tools,
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.960]   web conferencing, and even specific line of business programs like veterinary office management or
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.360]   yoga studio management. Thousands of programs, but here's the best part.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:09.360]   You go in there, you say, "Here's what I'm looking for. I need software to monitor whatever."
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.040]   "I need CAD software." That's a good example.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.400]   But a specific kind of CAD. You can narrow it down. See, on the left, there's all these filters
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.720]   where you could say, "Feechures the program has." You can narrow it down by reviews.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.400]   You know how many stars it has, product rating. You can compare them then side by side.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.280]   There's so many apps on here, which is so nice that you really have a broad choice,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:39.760]   but this is when Kepterra really becomes valuable. 950,000 reviews of products with a thousand new
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.000]   reviews every day. They're going to, in a couple of months, they'll have over a million up-to-date
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   reviews by actual users. That's what makes Kepterra so fantastic. You're not going in blind.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.440]   You're going, you're getting recommendations for software, and then you're getting reviews
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:17:00.960]   from actual users so you can choose the right product for your needs. Stop suffering with old,
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.720]   out-of-date line of business software. Start using modern software. There's great new software
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:12.240]   out there. If you could only find it, now you can at Kepterra. Go to kepterra.com/macbreak.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:19.120]   C-A-P-T-E-W-R-A.com/macbreak. I kind of left the most important part out. It's absolutely free.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.640]   Free. I know you'd pay for this. It's such a great service, but they don't charge. It's absolutely
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:34.080]   free. Kepterra.com/macbreak. What a great service. Support us by supporting them. Thank you, Kepterra,
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:42.560]   for your support. Go to kepterra.com/macbreak. Andy Anaco, let's start with you today. Your pick
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:48.960]   of the week. Mine's kind of a golden oldie, but it's still brand new. I was talking to Jason
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.720]   Snell the other day, and he was recommending saying how much he liked using default folder X
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.440]   as a system enhanced by Mac. Exactly. That was my real
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.640]   thing. That was my real thing. That was exactly my reaction.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:06.800]   The default is a classic Mac utility that enhances the open save dialogue.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.400]   Think of almost everything that you ever do that involves being confronted with an open save
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:18.640]   dialogue. I need to go into the finder, too, because I need to create this, or I need to move this
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:25.680]   first. Gosh, why is this app always open this folder when I really wanted to open this other
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.240]   folder on my Dropbox? All these things that complicate open saved file dialogue boxes,
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:38.000]   default folder X will fix for you. You can define, for a certain app, it will always, always,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.800]   always bounce to a specific folder as the default, not whatever the Mac OS thinks that you want to use.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.880]   It will keep better track of recently used folders. It will go directly to the finder from pretty
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.480]   much wherever you want to go on and on and on and on. Just little features that just really
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.200]   just enhance everything that you do if it ever involves opening or saving a file.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:07.440]   It's really well made. They're updating it for Catalina. They have a beta for Catalina out
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.480]   right now for people who have the public beta right now. This is not like an abandoned app that
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.720]   was sort of updated for Mac OS X and maybe there are still some diehards who are still using it.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:24.240]   No, it's still a very, very fresh and vital product. I downloaded the 30-day free trial a
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.960]   couple of weeks ago. I'm like, dang it, I'm going to have to buy this R&I because I'm now.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.440]   Now when I switch from the MacBook to my desktop, which doesn't have it installed,
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:41.040]   I'm annoyed that I can't use default folder. It's $35, but I'm very much in the reason why this is
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:48.640]   still a modern, completely of up-to-date and completely well-supported app in 2019 after 50,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:53.600]   60, 70 years. It predates the moon landings, as a matter of fact, is because they charge a
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.120]   amount of money that is commensurate with the amount of work they put into it. So I'm very,
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.280]   very happy to give them 35 bucks for this. It predates the moon landing.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.360]   That's the most of... That was 1969. I don't think it's quite that all.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:13.680]   Okay, well, were you looking like everywhere on the internet in 1968? You had to download it
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.480]   from an Archie server, but if you're in the know, if you're one of the cognizanties...
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:26.000]   I can't... It is about that old. I mean, I'm amazed that it's... I haven't heard that name in so long.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.400]   It's probably St. Clair software was probably one guy named Bob Sinclair or something, right?
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.840]   That's just awesome. I just love it. John Goetal actually is the name.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.880]   Oh, but it is. One guy. One guy. Really nice.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.760]   Yes, he, Dave, you've been around long enough too. You remember all of this.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.840]   I do. Yeah, I do. That's awesome. He's got some new stuff too. He's doing. So that's cool.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:51.520]   Can't believe it's 64-bit. Our little programs all grown up.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.720]   There weren't 64 bits in all the computers in the world when this app was first released.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:02.160]   This app was on the Apollo guidance computer.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.480]   Exactly. See, this is why it cost so much money because it was distributed on braided rope core
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.360]   memory that has to be hand braided for every single installation. I think you've been enjoying
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.480]   all the documentaries. I mean, I could listen to that's one small step for man over and over and
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:28.400]   over again. Actually, the thing I always get chills is not actually the first step on the moon,
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:35.280]   but the landing of the lunar lander and Neil Armstrong saying Houston, Tranquility Base here,
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:41.200]   Eagle has landed. I get chills just saying it out loud. And also copy that Tranquility.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.360]   Thanks for that. They were trying to blue take the river breathing again. Isn't that awesome?
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.000]   I mean, I could hear that over and over again. I'm still getting chills 50 years later.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:58.400]   One of the I think there's very few things human beings have done in our 80,000 years on the planet
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.200]   that are as significant or as amazing or as just mind boggling as that.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.880]   Dave Hamilton, we are not going to be strangers. I hope you will come back. It's always a pleasure
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:15.200]   to have you love to come back. Mac, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I know you're done. That's why I started
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.800]   with the program for backup. So thanks a lot. See you later. See you next week.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.760]   Dave's at the Mac Observer, Mac Observer.com. And of course, the Mac Gabb Fest is almost as long
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.320]   running. I think maybe you are a little longer running than Mac Brake. We call it Mac Geek Gabb,
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.600]   but you can call it Mac Gabb Fest. Whatever. Whatever. You know what I meant? We've been called worse.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.560]   That's right. You know what I meant? What's your pick of the week, David?
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.800]   It was going to be the wise bulbs. But when Andy said default folder, my second pick was also
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.560]   from St. Clair software. So I decided to do that, which is app teamer. This app. So if you're
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.000]   running one of the computers that was used in the moon landing, some of the CPU usage of apps that
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.560]   are out there might be a little much. But even if you're running one of these brand new 2019 iMacs,
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:07.200]   sometimes like the spotlight index or MD worker starts running rough shots or backup Ds,
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:13.280]   right? For time machine starts running all over the place. App teamer lets you pick which apps you
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.600]   want to throttle. And only when they hit a certain percentage of CPU.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.520]   When Dave says throttle, he doesn't mean strangle, although you may want to strangle them.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:29.280]   Correct. You can actually completely stop them too. It like this will let you do all of that.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.600]   That's awesome. It's one of my favorite apps to use. I started using it because I had some older
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.880]   Macs that were running and then quickly realized, wait, I want this on my podcasting machine so that
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.880]   like spotlight. Oh, you know what? We got to get everybody who uses Macs to do Skype with us.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.120]   Lori Gill, we got to get them all to use this because that's a big problem.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:56.480]   We the other day we had all these lip sync issues with Scott Wilkinson and a brilliant guy in our
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:02.080]   chat room said, oh, tell them to close Chrome and it all got better. App teamer would have
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.520]   used all the CPU. App teamer would. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's it really is. It's one of those things
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.680]   because like spotlight will kick in when you're not using your mouse or your keyboard. Well,
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:18.400]   talking also uses my computer. It was like, no, I want to like I need to stop it. And so
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.000]   app tamer does that and it it's awesome. Really works well. Yeah. Wow. There you go. 15 bucks in
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.520]   St. Clair software. Same guy. My Chester's best friend. When did you start the Geekfest?
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:41.440]   The Geekfest started on June 13 2005. Okay. So you might actually predate Mac break weekly.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.960]   I think you do. The Mac. Yeah. Not my moon landing. Yeah. The moon landing. Yeah. That's right.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:54.080]   GAB podcast. You're up to episode 770. So we're only at 723. We're just a child.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.440]   Just a child compared to you. Well, and then I look at like Adam Christensen with Maccast and I
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.680]   feel like I've just begun. Yeah. It's like, yeah, I think Brian, a bit with cover. I don't know how
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.600]   you stay so young looking after 15 years in podcasting. It's the drums.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.240]   Man, that's how I do it. I am thrilled that you were here. Thank you for joining us. Come back
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.320]   again soon. Okay. Thanks for having me. I would love to come back. Thanks so much. Yeah.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.600]   It's a deal. Macobserver.com. And of course, the great Lori Giel. What's your pick of the week
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:28.480]   this week, Lori? This week I'm going with a movie that I watched recently. I think it only
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.240]   came out about a week or week and a half and a go and it's called mid summer. It is by the
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:41.280]   same guy that directed hereditary Ari Aster and mid summer like hereditary is pretty
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:50.160]   intense. It's unusual. This is a sort of the opposite version of dark. It's actually quite
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:58.720]   bright in the way it's presented to us, but it tells the same unusual, weird story. And if you
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:07.520]   if you ever saw Wicker Man, it's nothing like it, but also a lot like it all at the same time.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:15.120]   You can tell that he loved that movie that he, you know, he cared about the weird story being
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.240]   told in that movie. You can see so many sort of parallels in the way this story is presented. And
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:26.560]   even at some points, I completely the opposite of parallels. Actually, it seems intentional.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:34.000]   So if you like hereditary, this is definitely different because it instead of being really
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.600]   dark and telling this creepy story, this is a really light version of a creepy story. So,
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.920]   you know, everything's bright and whitewashed. You can see in this in this example here,
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.760]   they're always in the sunshine and everyone wears white. So it's kind of
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.440]   summer, right? Yeah, yeah, it's the story, you know, the same same type of story that's told in
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:27:00.080]   Wicker Man of this sort of like group of people that celebrates, you know, like the changing of
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.680]   the seasons. And you know, I don't want to go into too many details, but you know, weird things in
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:14.320]   Sue. It's from A24 Films. Can you watch it online? No, you do you go to the movies? Where do you?
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:21.680]   Yeah, it's still in theaters. So it'll probably pop up on your streaming services in the next
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.000]   week or two. So if you don't go to the theater to see it, which I recommend you do, it's actually
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.240]   really nice to see a movie like that on the big screen. It will appear on the iTunes and probably
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:38.400]   a couple other streaming services at some point soon. It seems so scary. It'll probably be on
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:48.240]   Shutter TV. Shutter, yeah. Seems so Scandinavian. But it's not. I can't remember what they are in.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:55.360]   It says New York. Upstate. No, no, they're in. Oh, yo, they're in Sweden. They are. They're in a
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:59.120]   remote Swedish village. They're from New York, but they're in a remote Swedish village. Okay.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's so far. You have the strangest taste.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:13.600]   I like horror films. Yeah. Is this a horror film or just a? It is. It is. Yeah, there's. Yeah,
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:19.600]   it's one of those. I think I hear people call them smart horror, which is to me a silly term,
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.400]   but it's like that kind of movie, like the witch and actually A24 makes a lot of films like that.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.040]   I loved the witch. I thought that was amazing. Yeah. Okay. So it's kind of like that. Yeah.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:35.200]   Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Laurie. Laurie is a managing editor at iMore. iMore.com. She appears as you
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.040]   heard on many of the iMore podcasts. And of course, on this show every week, we love having you on.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.680]   Thank you, Laurie. Thanks so much for having me on. Thank you all for being here. We do Mac
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.480]   Break Weekly every Tuesday. We usually try to get in about 11 a.m. and Leslie is running late,
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.960]   which he was today. I apologize. That's 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1700 UTC. You can
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.760]   join us on the live stream. If you want to watch or listen as we do the show, you can watch it
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:07.280]   being made at twit.tv/live. If you're doing that, go in the chat room because that's where
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:13.680]   everybody else is who's hanging out watching live. irc.twit.tv. Yes, you can use an irc client,
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.840]   but you can also use your web browser. irc.twit.tv. If you want to be in studio, we had a great studio
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:26.160]   audience visiting us from Germany this week also from Modesto, California in Salt Lake City. And
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.800]   we had a lot of people in here in Atlanta, Georgia. Thank you to everybody coming by.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:33.920]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv. We'll put a chair out for you.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.520]   You can also download copies of everything we do because that's what it means to be a podcast.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.920]   As Dave well knows, just go to twit.tv. For this show, it's twit.tv/ios.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:57.120]   Twit.tv/ios. No, no, no, no, it's twit.tv/mbw. It's the GeekGab Fest podcast. It's twit.tv.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:03.280]   I don't know what I'm doing. Maybe 15 years in podcasting is too long, Dave Hamilton.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:12.560]   Twit.tv/mbw stands for Mac, Break, Weekly. But you can avoid this entire confusion.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:18.560]   If you just fire up your podcast app and subscribe, then as you and I get a little more
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:25.840]   doddering in our old age, the show will still arrive on our phone ready to listen to the minute
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.560]   it's available. Thank you so much for being here. But it's now, I'm sorry to say, time to get back
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:35.200]   to work cause break time is over. I remember that much. Bye-bye.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:47.600]   Bye-bye.
