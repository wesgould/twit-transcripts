[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960]   Joining us right now, as usual, Mr. Andy Inotco and the Squirrel
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.400]   Cam.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.880]   Hello, Andrew Inotco and the Squirrel Cam.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.680]   Well, now that Rita St. Kelly Lee is folding,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.000]   I thought I'd try out an eager young co-host.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.880]   I just sort of like the demographic.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.480]   I think I'm trending more towards a middle-aged nerd.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   So by getting some younger eye candy,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920]   we feel as though we'll get some of that Facebook generation.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.160]   We're going to get the big squirrel demographic.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.760]   I'm excited.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.160]   Also, a lot of dogs who like to stare at things in bark.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.080]   Squirrel.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.680]   There's a lot of consumer money there.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.120]   Squirrel.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120]   We're chasing the consumer dollar.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.640]   Ozzy's gone.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.960]   Squirrel.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   Squirrel.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.480]   We'll explain that in a moment before I say hello to Lander
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   Connie, who is, of course, the guy behind the cult of Mac.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.280]   Turn around.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.040]   Your head doesn't have an apple shape in it.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.880]   Out of--
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.880]   Out of--
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.760]   That's, you know, focus.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.680]   What's focus?
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.280]   What is focus mean to any of us?
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   It's not about the movie.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.680]   You are.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.640]   You're a little bit like that guy who's always out of focus.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.000]   Why are you out of focus?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.560]   Are you--
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.760]   I'm focused for me.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   Oh, you're-- oh, good.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.280]   For you, you look good.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.520]   I will see, you know, sometimes what Skype does
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.560]   with an inadequate bandwidth.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.160]   I don't know why it does this, but it makes it look softer.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.000]   It un-crisps it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.080]   But Lander, most people are listening by audio,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.040]   so they're thinking, what are they talking about?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.560]   He's in perfect focus for me.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.800]   Perfect.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.640]   Your audio is perfectly sharp.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.280]   Perfectly sharp.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.120]   So I think a big story for Apple fans today
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.520]   is that Amazon beat Apple to the punch
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.840]   and announced cloud storage for MP3s.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   Something that La La was doing, right?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.040]   Is this kind of like La La?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.560]   Is this kind of what Apple was thinking
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.000]   of doing in North Carolina, Andy?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.160]   Maybe and maybe not.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.800]   I tried it out this morning, and it's very, very simple.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   They've added a cloud storage service that's free for everybody.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.480]   Five, you get five gigs for free.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.360]   The twist is that since they sell so much content,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.320]   any purchases you make from Amazon MP3
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.120]   will supposedly automatically be added to this storage,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.000]   and it doesn't count against your five gigabyte total.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   As a matter of fact, you will get another 20 gigabytes
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240]   of free storage just by virtue of the fact
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.680]   that you're buying Amazon MP3s.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.000]   The other nice hitch is that you can download a free helper app
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.320]   that I installed it and it scanned my entire iTunes
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.960]   library for any kinds of audio content
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.400]   that its streaming player could actually handle
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.680]   and allowed me to upload the entire collection,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   just selected playlists.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.560]   So we're not talking about just Amazon purchases here.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.840]   Any MP3, any file that their streaming cloud service can
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.040]   handle will be uploaded automatically.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.080]   And you can play it all back via the web,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.440]   via very nice little player that manages playlists,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.600]   it's a really nice iTunes-ish sort of experience.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.080]   And if you happen to have one of those Android devices,
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.000]   they'll also give you a free app
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.360]   that lets you transfer all that content
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.640]   into your device, stream it without actually downloading it.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.160]   It really is quite slick.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.280]   And if there are people who are a little bit on the fence
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.640]   between Android and iPhone for pocket devices,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.840]   and I think that's a very, very smart thing to be doing
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.080]   because the Android device is getting much, much better,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.840]   a lot of people, I think that's going to tip the scales
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.680]   for them.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.120]   - There is no iOS version of this.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.720]   - There is no iOS version of it.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.360]   On your Mac desktop, obviously the web player will work.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   If you load up the web player on your iPad,
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.920]   it will load in, but it won't actually function.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.560]   So it does work via Adobe Air.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.960]   So that's probably the hitch to it.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   I don't know if Amazon would even be prejudiced against iOS.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.280]   They've always been interested in just making sure
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.440]   that anybody can buy their content and play it
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.000]   on anything, realize that there is no device
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.200]   that does not have a Kindle app available for it.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.160]   So I think that the reason why it's only available
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.040]   for Android on mobile devices right now
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.200]   is because that's where a lot of their talent is right now.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.800]   I wouldn't be surprised if we saw an iOS player
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.120]   in the future, and if we saw that web player
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.720]   open up to iOS, and I can't do it with Safari right now.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.560]   - Yes, you can.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.400]   - I can't.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   - You can play it with mobile Safari.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.600]   - Oh, okay.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.840]   - Only one song at a time.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.680]   - Really?
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.000]   (laughs)
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.320]   - You can't do it.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.640]   You have to hit the download link,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.040]   and then it opens up in--
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.200]   - Interesting.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.520]   Okay, meaning that it will actually--
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.360]   - Meaning that I can play--
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.480]   - It's like a lot of songs, but not,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.320]   you can't play this.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   - But it will, so it's playing via iOS quick look.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.600]   - It's something like that.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.440]   I'm already sure what it is.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.760]   Yeah, I think it opens up in whatever application you've
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   associated with whatever file.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.360]   So quick time, I think most frequently.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.200]   - Ah, interesting.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   - If you have, you can do it inside one of the browsers,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   the other alternative browsers.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   - Yeah, I'm trying that right now just to see.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.400]   - Actually, it was interesting that it'll play video too.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.240]   - Oh.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.080]   - So, I think it will go down.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.160]   - And now, do they currently store stuff in,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.000]   and they don't, it's only music right now that's in the cloud.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.920]   - No, you can even store it.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.000]   It's a regular Dropbox style storage.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.840]   - Oh, look at this though.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.680]   - Look at this.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.320]   - Your browser is not supported in saying--
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.080]   - Yeah, that's what I got this morning,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.120]   and if you click through that, it will load up the player,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.800]   and I was able to tap on songs,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.440]   and it looked like it was trying to play it,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.920]   but it would just never, the scrubber would never move past
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   the zero minutes, zero seconds.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.760]   - Are you doing this?
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.600]   - One way.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.160]   - Yeah, you have to click and hold, I think,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.040]   and hit the download link.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.440]   There's a down, there should be a pop down menu.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.600]   - So instead of the player link, I have to do the download link.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.440]   - Yeah.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.520]   - And then, okay, so I'm gonna check that and download.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.400]   That's just kind of a workaround because, okay.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.360]   - That's just the standard behavior that would
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.000]   be in any web browser.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.920]   - Right.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.160]   - So now I'm just gonna try, yeah,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.600]   'cause I'm gonna try, it's gonna play it,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.120]   as you said, the lander through quick time.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.960]   - Yeah.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.520]   - Okay, but one song at a time.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.560]   Hey, at least I have access to it.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   - That's the standard iOS.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.200]   - Yeah.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.480]   Is there any way I can save that now to my iPad?
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.320]   No.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.160]   - No.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   - I don't believe so, no.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.840]   But someone's gonna come out with an app pretty quickly.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.920]   - I think it's just a matter of time,
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.760]   and I don't think there's any reason why
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.040]   there shouldn't be an app, right?
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.440]   - I think Amazon's gonna come out with that.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.360]   I don't see, and they're not a company that cares.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.040]   They don't have allegiance to Google,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.240]   they just have allegiance to their own app store,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.200]   and their own content store.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.560]   So I think, I would not be surprised if somewhere inside
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   there there was decision that,
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.720]   let's develop the Android app first,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.480]   'cause we know for, 'cause given that we own an app store,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.080]   we know for a fact that we can get this installed on all,
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.160]   it will get approved for all Android devices.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.920]   We're not so 100% sure that if we write the iOS app first,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.480]   that Apple will allow it immediately.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.280]   It gets, it's kind of an end around on the music companies.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   It, in effect, means that once you bought a song on,
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.440]   when you buy a song on iTunes and you download it,
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.920]   without Apple, you know, you can only download it once,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.840]   you're supposed to back it up,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.920]   and we know that you can call Apple once in a while
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.400]   and say, "Oh, I lost everything,"
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.560]   and they'll kind of re-let you re-download it,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.080]   but it's not, you're not supposed to.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.080]   Now, if you buy something on Amazon MP3,
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.000]   it's on your cloud storage up to 20 gigabytes.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.200]   So in a way, that's kind of like re-download.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.800]   That's the only thing, it seems to me,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.400]   that it's a real advantage.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.640]   I guess being able to stream it to your phone is of advantage,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.480]   although with the RDO and Rhapsody
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.280]   and all these other streaming services,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.360]   I'm not sure you gain much by that.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.040]   - But there's a stream ownership, even with the--
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.880]   - Right, people like to own ownership, right.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.080]   - People like to own it, yeah.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.400]   - But also, remember that, it's not just the stuff you purchase,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.200]   it's also the stuff that's already on your system.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.040]   So I quickly uploaded to Playlist,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.120]   and that means that now any device that I have,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.760]   that's not an iOS device.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.080]   - And that's okay, can you do it all?
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.720]   - Can access that and play without any syncing.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.240]   - Leander.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.840]   - Well, the fact that Amazon can do this now
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.680]   is gonna be a sign that the record companies are--
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.520]   - Relenting.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.800]   - Leasing the licensing terms a little,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.520]   and sure it's gonna come to Apple too.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.280]   Apparently the big trouble with Apple
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.720]   implementing this was that the record companies wanted
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.240]   to assure that people were downloading to devices
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.320]   that they owned, and not down into other people's devices.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.720]   - Is there a guarantee through Amazon system
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.560]   that that's the case?
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.480]   I don't think so, right?
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.320]   You could play it. - Well, the clue,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.720]   I don't think so, no, I just imagine
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.560]   they're loosening it up a little bit.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.200]   - I just log into my Amazon account
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.440]   and on any device and I could play it.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.320]   - That's what I found so interesting.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.160]   I would have expected that all Amazon MP3 purchases
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.360]   would transfer over, but it was transferring over
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   stuff that I'd ripped from CD.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.080]   That stuff I downloaded from God knows where.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.120]   It doesn't seem to be, all it seemed to be looking for
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.520]   is is it encoded with the right type of encoding
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.880]   for the streaming players to serve?
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.720]   - Yeah.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   - And this was what the rumor was that Apple
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.840]   was building the North Carolina data center for,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.440]   that they were gonna, that's why they bought Lala
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.680]   'cause Lala did something similar.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.240]   So-- - This was the Lala thing, dude.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.880]   Yeah, this is what the Lala service did almost, exactly.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.440]   - So, I mean, this is good.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.960]   20 gigs is not enough for most many people.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.280]   I don't know, 20 gigs is,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.800]   I couldn't put my record collection on it,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.480]   but I guess 20, I could put 20 gigs of music.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.000]   That's the significant amount.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.280]   It's more than I could put on my iPod, I guess.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.400]   Is it an-- - Yeah, you probably
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.920]   should build lists, playlists, just the streaming.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.600]   - Wait a minute, I can get 160 gig iPod
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.400]   so I can even put more on my iPod.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.080]   - Yeah, remember that that's just for free content.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.880]   If you wanna expand it, you can plus--
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.760]   - That's right, everything you buy on Amazon,
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.280]   so I think this is my understanding.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.680]   20 gigs immediately opens up when you buy an album
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.520]   on Amazon, but everything you buy on Amazon
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.360]   does not count against it, so you could buy all your,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   this is a big advantage for Amazon.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.040]   All music you buy on Amazon is stored for free automatically.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.160]   - That's my understanding.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.200]   I do have a couple of questions in
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.560]   just to make sure that I understand it correctly,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.440]   but that is my understanding.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   And doesn't it give people sort of that extra sort of oomph
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.360]   that if they don't, there's a lot of people
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   that don't really know whether they should be buying music
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.320]   by iTunes or by Amazon MP3, this is a nice advantage.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.120]   If I know that every single purchase I buy,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.480]   I don't even have to worry about ever uploading it back
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.560]   to this Amazon cloud service,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.920]   that I know that I'll have it on iTunes,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.360]   I know I'll automatically have it available
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.960]   for streaming wherever I go, over the course of a year or two,
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.320]   all the albums and all the tracks,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.680]   just automatically being available for streaming,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.400]   that's interesting, that's definitely gonna turn my head.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.280]   - Yeah, I'm excited, I think this is great.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.640]   Leander, do you think Apple will immediately
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.840]   like in the next week or two announce something similar?
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.120]   - I doubt it, no.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.080]   I think Apple's, they've got time to take their time
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.800]   to come up with some alternative,
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.360]   but I think they've got to get into streaming.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.760]   All of the most exciting music services are streaming,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.200]   Spotify, radio, Napster, Rhapsody, even those guys,
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.040]   are pretty good.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.360]   I got a Sonos system.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.200]   - Love Sonos.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.840]   - It's absolutely awesome, yeah.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.160]   - 'Cause I use radio on Sonos.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   - I don't have to use it on the Sony music internet.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.640]   - Yeah, I can use Rhapsody or radio on Sonos.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.160]   Oh, now that would be a nice app,
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.560]   and I bet you Sonos will announce this any minute now,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.120]   is it access to your clouds?
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.960]   Amazon Cloud on Sonos, that gets really--
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.920]   So for those who don't know, I know you know Andy,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.120]   those Sonos's are those Wi-Fi,
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.560]   they're just speakers, you plug them in the wall,
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.920]   they hook up into your Wi-Fi,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.840]   and then can play music from the internet,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.160]   radio, you know, Pandora, Rhapsody, RDO,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.760]   and can play your collection using the iTunes music server,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.120]   but even better if they could use this cloud storage,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.400]   then my whole, from now on, I mean,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.760]   I guess the question is, why buy from iTunes?
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.560]   Is this gonna hurt iTunes?
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.760]   It's at for a while.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.920]   - Yeah, I don't see any point in buying music at all.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.040]   (laughing)
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.120]   - Why not just steal it all, put it on Amazon?
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.440]   No, no, but if you're gonna buy music,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   this is a major, well, you're right.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.920]   I mean, you've got RDO, you've got Rhapsody,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   you've got Spotify outside the US,
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.560]   so you pay the $10 a month fee, and you've got it.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   - It makes much sense, I think,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.360]   'cause you get a whole bunch of new music,
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.960]   you get a much, much bigger access
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.720]   to a much bigger library than you would
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.320]   if you were buying it once, I'm at a time,
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.680]   I'm from either iTunes or Amazon.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.280]   - I know nobody cares about this.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.040]   Is there a quality concern?
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.160]   Do I get better quality music if I buy it on Amazon?
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.600]   Isn't it 320 kilobits every threes?
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.520]   - Yeah, they were one of the first ones to go to
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.320]   high bit rate, right, high bit rate and in long.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.520]   Although it's gonna really define for people
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.600]   how they listen to music.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.880]   I like Rhapsody and I like Pandora,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.640]   but I like to have music that I own and I control
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.440]   and that I can simply assemble and get on the fly.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.240]   I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be having,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.120]   making sure that my access to my music
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.440]   is always dependent on a separate app.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.720]   So I do like buying it down, letting it be.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   - But let me ask the question again.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   Does this mean that, well, actually,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.000]   I can ask the chat room too.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.720]   Alex Lindsey, who's not here today,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.760]   he's taking the day off, he's in Paris, I think,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   is always said, oh, but the experience buying music
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.280]   is so much better on iTunes, that's why I don't buy it.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.200]   Even though I know it's cheaper on Amazon,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.000]   I've been buying most of my music on Amazon these days.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.400]   Does this mean a mass exodus away from iTunes
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.760]   or are people who are gonna stay with iTunes
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.080]   just 'cause it's easy?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.360]   - I'm not sure if there could ever be a mass exodus away
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.200]   'cause it is so simple, especially since
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.320]   that there are always those mobile apps
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.080]   allow purchasing to be so easy and so pretty much instinctive.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.240]   - And Alex is right, iTunes does a really good job
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.840]   of saying here are things that are similar
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.040]   to the thing you're looking for right now.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.000]   But I find myself more and more,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.840]   if I use the iTunes store to browse,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.960]   I'm very often going to the Amazon store to purchase.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.760]   - We should mention that this is,
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.080]   right now, as of now, this is US only in the Amazon MP3 store.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.880]   So I'm talking about US only at this point.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.480]   Of course, if you're outside the US,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.000]   you'll continue to buy where you buy.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.560]   Dr. Mom says, I'm gonna leave iTunes
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.640]   because of this, Lenin 201 says,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.320]   you'd have to be seriously lazy
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.440]   to choose iTunes over as Amazon now.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.920]   Unless you set your account to auto-renew to a paid plan,
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.680]   the 20 gigabyte plan reverts to a free plan
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.880]   one year from the date of your MP3 album purchase.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.840]   So you have to continue to buy one MP3 album purchase
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   a year to keep getting the 20 gigabytes.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.640]   I don't know what the paid plan is.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.480]   Have they announced a paid plan?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.720]   Additional storage plans, oh yeah, here they are,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.280]   are available from 22 terabyte.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.600]   Holy cow, so a terabyte is $1,000 a year.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.680]   (laughing)
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.200]   I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.080]   You could put video on this as well.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.360]   - Also known as the BitTorrent plan.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.280]   - So it's a flat rate buck a gigabyte a year.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.960]   That's what it costs.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.600]   Buck a big gigabyte a year.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.920]   It's free though, if 20 gigs is free,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.240]   if you buy one MP3 album from Amazon.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.040]   And of course, as long as you continue to buy all your songs,
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.240]   this really does encourage you to buy your music
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.400]   if you're gonna buy music from Amazon.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.520]   But Leander, you're not giving up your,
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.120]   what do you have, Spotify, what do you have?
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.520]   - Actually, I do have Spotify, yeah.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.640]   But I have to go jump through all these hoops to get it.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.400]   I had to buy a, what do you call it,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.080]   to VPN, a British VPN.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.200]   - Right, 'cause you can't do it in a live London IP address.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.680]   But I use it for the BBC's I Player 2.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.520]   - Ah, so you already have that.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:04.440]   - Yeah, so it does, it goes a little bit too far.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.000]   But you know, radio here in this country.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.120]   - I like radio or audio or whatever it's called.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.440]   I like it.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.120]   - I think times have changed.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.000]   Steve Joseph's right when he said that people want to own
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.720]   and buy their music and they want to buy a dollar a time.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.200]   But that was 10 years ago.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.000]   I think these days now it makes much more sense
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.480]   to get a subscription service.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.880]   And even Rhapsody and apps are really good too.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.040]   - You know what's really interesting is that
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.280]   an audio file will say this.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.000]   This is the end of high quality recordings.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I mean, it just means everybody's using MP3 now.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And why would you, you know, I mean, you'd have to be--
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.120]   - I guess it's true, you know.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   - I don't know if that's the end.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.760]   It's everybody that we know buys all their music digitally.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.960]   But the last time that I saw sales figures
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.040]   for what percentage of the entire music market is CD,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   it's still hugely the majority of sales worldwide.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.440]   It's trending downward, but it's still,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.040]   I seem to remember to still something above 70%
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.720]   or 75%. - Our CDs.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.680]   - Physical media is still by dollar unit sales.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.800]   The main driver of sales.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.600]   - There's nowhere in my little town of Petaluma
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.960]   that I could buy a CD.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.720]   Oh, I take it back, Starbucks.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.200]   They have five.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.080]   But there's no record store anymore.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.280]   The last one closed months ago.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.720]   There's a Best Buy down the road out of town
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.120]   that still sells CDs last time I checked.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.880]   But who sells CDs anymore?
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.440]   Target Best Buy Walmart.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.280]   - Amazon?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.320]   - Amazon, yeah, you're right.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.920]   - I still buy, if almost all of my album purchases
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.880]   are still via CD, because if I'm gonna buy the entire album,
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.960]   it's worth a couple extra bucks to have uncompressed,
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.840]   highest quality archival that I could then transcode
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.240]   into whatever compression format I ever want anytime.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.640]   - I agree, but then you got this plastic.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.280]   You've got to get rid of it.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.200]   - I'll keep it, no, we'll keep it,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.840]   because that's why later on,
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.720]   to 10 years from now, I might want to remaster
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.600]   to something else, because it's an unlocked,
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.720]   uncompressed format I'll have a really good master
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.560]   to go from.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.480]   If there's any reason why I will always have
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.840]   at least one storage locker,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.920]   it's so that I always have all the paper books
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.520]   that I might ever want to remaster,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.120]   all the laser discs I might want to remaster
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.520]   and all the CDs I might want to remaster.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.360]   (laughing)
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.200]   - I have to say, I have to say--
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.040]   - And the comics.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.200]   - But audio files are increasingly a minority
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.360]   and that almost everybody now listens to compressed music
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.000]   with crappy earpuds on an iPod.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.840]   - Exactly.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.520]   - If you listen to me, you're right, but earphones,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   you're not gonna excel.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.560]   - It's terrible.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.520]   And this just encourages that,
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.240]   although in a way, more people are listening to music
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.880]   than ever before, but on the other hand,
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.960]   the music they're listening to is of somewhat inferior
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.000]   reproduction.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.240]   - One of the interesting things about Amazon's move today
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.720]   is that it shows that they are probably
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.200]   a much bigger competitor to Apple than most people
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.360]   give it credit for.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.640]   - Yes, sir.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.480]   - They're the only one,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.320]   the big weakness with Android is the lack of,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.000]   you know, content strategy.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.520]   They don't have a store where you can go and buy
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.320]   a movie, it's not easy to get,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.920]   it's still a pain in the ass to get video onto,
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.760]   you know, your Android tablet.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.360]   You can't load it up the way you can.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.560]   - Just a matter of time before Amazon does that, right?
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.400]   - Absolutely.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.080]   - They've got the Android App Store now,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.120]   much to Apple, Chagrin.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.880]   They've got this cloud storage on Android now.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.440]   I think it's just a matter of time before they're doing
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.200]   cloud storage, sales of music, and movies as well as music.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.320]   In fact, I don't know why they didn't launch that.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.000]   - I honestly feel as though this is kind of like
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.240]   that moment in the game where the manager walks up to the
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.520]   mound, puts his hand on the pitcher's shoulder,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.720]   and he asks for that ball, because Google has had
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.480]   a few years now to actually do something serious
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.600]   with Android and they've been nothing but
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.200]   beating batters and consumers for three years now.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.080]   This is Android saying, guys, you got kind of an OKOS here.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.360]   What you need is a bunch of grownups who actually know
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.840]   how to make a consumer product.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.040]   - I think from Google's point of view,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.280]   that's exactly what they want.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.120]   And I don't think Google wants to become a retail agent.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   - That's great.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.120]   - All they care about is--
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.960]   - They want partridge.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.560]   - What they want is people to use the OS
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.120]   and to use their browsers so they get
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.560]   the click-throughs and they get that metric of that information.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.240]   - So Google's glad to leave the mound and say--
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.080]   - I'd say so.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   They would have been glad or if their bookstore
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.400]   made any traction whatsoever, they would have been glad
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.560]   or if they were able to do anything with selling music
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.720]   and content like that.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.960]   I think that deep, deep down when they get--
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.080]   Gonna get them good and drunk, they'll all admit that
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.000]   we have no idea what we're doing there.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.040]   We know how to--
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.000]   They're layers between the CPU and the user,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.560]   and Google gets lost somewhere well before the user.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.040]   And at some point, that's where you hand the ball to someone
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.520]   like Amazon to make a nice final product.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.640]   - Yeah, and I think that it also raises,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.320]   monopoly questions that Google doesn't want to have to answer.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.200]   So let, it's nice.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.600]   Let there'll be an ecosystem.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.120]   Apple, that's where Apple's success is
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.840]   in this kind of unified ecosystem.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.320]   But if Google does it all, there's gonna be a lot
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.440]   of antitrust questions.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.320]   So it's good, Google likes it.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.080]   Let Amazon do it, that's great.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.920]   - I agree.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   - That's good.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.120]   And I think Google makes its money in advertising.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   Let's not check that out.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.880]   - I don't think they care.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.000]   Very interesting.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.280]   We're gonna find out what Andy's doing
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.840]   with a squirrel eating behind him.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.160]   And frankly, that squirrel is hungry
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.360]   because he hasn't stopped eating since the show began.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.280]   - That's a different squirrel.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.800]   We, Blabber Law says we have to hire twins.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.640]   - Ah.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.880]   - And so they get, every squirrel gets 15 minutes on,
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.720]   15 minutes on.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.560]   - Perfect.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.400]   - Perfect.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.240]   Do they have a little spit bucket?
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.880]   - No, no, no, no child.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.720]   No, no, no animal rights letters please.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.360]   They're really very happy.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.360]   - We'll put a disclaimer at the end of the show
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.520]   saying no squirrels were harmed
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.080]   in the making of Mac break weekly.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.640]   - No trans fats in the peanut butter either.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.080]   - No, it's healthy food.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.400]   Coming up also, a visit from Kat and Neil,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.760]   the guy who puts together those crazy geek cruises,
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.000]   Macmania.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.400]   I was just on the Macmania 11, had a blast.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.600]   You've been on many Macmania's, I know Andy.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.920]   And there's a couple coming up that I'm not gonna be on,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.120]   but I thought it'd be fun to get Neil on to talk about him.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.800]   One I'm not gonna be on because it's going to San Francisco.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.560]   However, I have already told Neil,
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.760]   if he wants to do an excursion to the Twig cottage
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.720]   for that particular cruise,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.360]   we'd be glad to have a bunch of tourists,
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.320]   lightly inebriated tourists come up here, it'd be great.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.560]   - Although you should make them require
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.240]   that they have the exact same polar gear
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.200]   that you bought for yourself.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.160]   - We'll put them on a bus.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.920]   They can drive by the cottage,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.480]   stop, take pictures and drive back.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.880]   It'll be great.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.720]   - No, you can't come in.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.560]   - You can't have some penguins on hand.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.840]   - Yeah, you know?
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.280]   That's the one thing missing, penguins.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.680]   We'll get some penguins.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.720]   - And before we continue though,
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.280]   I would like to say hello to my friends
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.400]   and your friends, I know it's, Jean is so great.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.680]   It's Smile Software.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.720]   You should be Smile on my Mac.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   They've redubbed themselves.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.520]   It's smilesoftware.com.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.560]   If you go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.360]   you could take advantage of a deal right now
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.560]   on a program that I have just been having a blast with.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.360]   Somebody asked me actually on the radio show this weekend.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.440]   He said, "I have this form.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.480]   I have to fill out.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.840]   It's a timesheet basically every week.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.680]   It's the same damn thing every week.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.800]   They email it to me.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.560]   I have to print it, write it and mail it back
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.640]   or fax it back to them.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.560]   Isn't there a better way?
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.520]   I said, "Yes."
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.160]   Go to smilesoftware.com
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.720]   and enter the 21st century.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.040]   Actually smilesoftware.com/macbreak,
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.880]   so we get credit for it.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.840]   Smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.280]   and take a look at this great program,
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.600]   PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.200]   There's a free trial so you can try it before you buy.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.760]   What does it do?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.080]   Well, Don actually did a great screencast,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.520]   so you can watch a screencast there to see what it does.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.560]   It allows you to open up a PDF file,
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.440]   make corrections, sign it.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.520]   You can even have a library with my signatures and my initial...
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.880]   My wife's signature and my signature are initials,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.120]   so I can buy a house.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.240]   I can do anything.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   She's given me full license to steal.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.960]   You can scan an original in it and edit it
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.560]   because it's got basic OCR built in.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.040]   You can redact.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.480]   I just redact for fun, just to have a good time.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.320]   I can...
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.880]   Just to make yourself look more interesting.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.920]   Yeah, I'll redact things from a contract.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.200]   I'll put nonsense phrases in there, then black them out.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.040]   It's fun.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.600]   This is a really great program
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.800]   and allows you to annotate, edit, modify PDFs.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.760]   Everybody uses PDFs now, even the IRS,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.440]   if you're doing your taxes.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.760]   They've got a form-filable PDF,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.920]   but it would sure be easier to just get the forms
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.480]   and download them and you'd be set.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.360]   This is such a cool program.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.160]   You can draw, you can write.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.000]   You can even shrink.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.440]   Sometimes PDFs are awfully big.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.360]   You can resize them or cut pages out.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.840]   You don't need repurpose them,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.360]   stamp them with a watermark.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.120]   All of that, it's wonderful.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.400]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.360]   And the best thing to do is go to
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.600]   smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   And take a look at it.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   There is a basic PDF Pen is $59.95,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   and then there's also the Pro version.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   You can get free trials there.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   I am duty-bound to tell you it's also in the App Store,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   but we don't get credit when you buy it in the App Store.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   On the other hand, you might want to do that.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   There's an advantage to doing it in the App Store
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   because this is really frustrating to me
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   with this App Store thing.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   A lot of apps, actually,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   rebying things like,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   I rebought Aperture, not only because it was cheaper,
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   but because then the App Store does the updates automatically.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   So, you know what, I'm going to take a hit here.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   We won't get credit for it,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   but you might want to buy it in the App Store.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   PDF Pen, PDF Pen Pro, smilesoftware.com
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   to find out more smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   Go there, spring their server down,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   and then you can buy it somewhere else.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   That's all we ask.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   It is really a great program,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   and we really love the smile software, folks.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.600]   And, you know, you know,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   there's no way we can track it if you buy it in the App Store,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   unfortunately.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   But it's so much easier.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   What do you...
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.600]   I mean, that's kind of one of the issues I have with the App Store,
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   as you're seeing.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   Well, there's even forking of programs.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   I think that bare-bones software has different...
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   like text Wranglers different in the App Store and stuff.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   And now, of course,
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   WWDC is coming up.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.600]   Apple announced it will be in June.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   Thank goodness.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.600]   They announced it more than a week ahead of time this time.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   I mean, last year,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600]   poor developers had, like, two weeks to make their plans
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   to come to San Francisco,
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.600]   sold out in one day, immediately,
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.600]   even though it's a $1,500 ticket, sold out immediately.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   They are going to have, for unlike last year,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   they're going to have Apple Design Awards for Macintosh apps,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   but only if they're in the App Store.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   So, Apple's definitely got a little bias towards the App Store.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   I'm going to bias towards the App Store.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   I love this idea of, you know,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   once I bought an app,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   being able to update it automatically,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   you know, it knows what I've bought
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   and I can just press update just like you do with iOS.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   Here's something I wonder about, though.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   Look at all these purchases.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   This is going to get pretty long.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   I don't find any way to delete these from,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   you know, even if I haven't installed it on this computer,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   for instance, I still have stuff in here.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   Is this list just going to get longer and longer and longer?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   These are my purchases.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   There's some structural issues here.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   What's your take on this, Lander?
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   You know, to be honest, I haven't actually used it that much.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   Oh, you will.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   You will.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   Yeah, it does look pretty slick.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   You know, it does for software,
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   what I changed it for music.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   Right.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   And so, I'm really tempted to buy more and more apps in there.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   You know, I said, I bought a new MacBook Pro
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   last over a few days ago.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   But you get the new one?
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   Yeah, that's just sweet.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   And that's just the colossal pain of the butt
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   because the four apps I've bought from the App Store
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   click one button, they all download, I'll revalidate.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   I had to go find my aperture code.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   I had to find, I still have to find my, I had to read,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   I had to re download my Scrivener code, had to, oh,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   of the six or seven apps, I really, really need for,
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   to make this into a daily, daily workhorse.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   I've only got three or four of them working because I'm still
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   looking for a frustration code for two or three.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   I can't wait until everything's in here.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   And I was disappointed because I was reinstalling logic yesterday.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.600]   My son's computer, hard drive died.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   And logic's not on here.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   I was going to pay them more money.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   They got an extra 80 bucks out of me just for the aperture.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   You know, if only aperture was made by the same company that runs
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   that app store, it should be, they'd have a way to valid,
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   revalidate this, just to get the same.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   You know what?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   They do have a way because guess what shows up in there?
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.600]   If you bought iLife 11, which on the new computer,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   the iLife 11's on there, it says installed in the App Store.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   So now it's part of the system automatically,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   even though I didn't buy it in the App Store.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   Nothing to say.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   A, Mr. Jobs?
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   Oh, he's not with us.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   I mean, so anyway, that I got off on a tangent.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   You should dare him to come on the show and refute these allegations.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   Yes, I dare you.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   No, I don't.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   No, I don't.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   Where's my wallet?
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   I got cash.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   Well, maybe I don't.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   But if I'll tell you what, I'll get.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   I'll go to the ATM, Steve.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   And what do you think?
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   You'll take 100?
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   200?
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   I'll $200, Steve Jobs.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   I'll have cash for you.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   All you have to cut dues come on the show.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   It's yours.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   That's a recycled Saturday Night Live joke.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   I shouldn't really take credit for that.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   Remember that?
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   They offered the Beatles 100 bucks.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   No, no, $3,000.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   $3,000 is a 10 year.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   $3,000.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   We will give you.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:45.120]   And unbeknownst to Lord Michaels, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were like at Lennon's house
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.040]   watching Sarah Net Live that night.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.600]   And they actually would have come and they decided, you know, it's kind of late.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   We're kind of tired.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.280]   Oh, oh, where'd you read that?
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   That's a great story.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   I love that.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.360]   That's from Paul McCartney.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   That is a great story.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.160]   Yeah, we thought about it.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   We could have used the money.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.240]   And now there's a Lord Michael size size.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   Lord Michael's head size hole in his office.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   Oh, damn it.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   Damn it.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   Because remember, I can't remember who it was.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   I think it was Michael.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   The guy with the little glasses and the weasel fetish who held up the check.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   I mean, it was Lauren.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   Lauren Michaels.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Lauren Michaels, not the other guy.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.240]   Get out to the Beatles.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.240]   The Beatles.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   You can split up all you want.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   You want to give, we go less.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   That's up to you.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   So, so, Annie, you're, I take it, you're using this.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   You're using the HDMI dongle.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   40 and $45.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   It goes on to your iPad.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   Yep.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   And, oh, the squirrel left.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Oh, that's okay.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   It's a shift change.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   It's like the one, it's like the Warren's Brothers cards.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   If you look at the very, very top, I'm sure that he'll be coming.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   He'll be coming.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   I'm now.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   Does he actually pop up?
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   It's like, is that playing off your iPad or is that off?
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   Yeah, there he comes.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240]   We discussed it.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   It's more dramatic and like the line.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   He comes in from the top of the rock.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   The circle of love.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   The only thing greater than yourself is squirrel.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   Wow.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   You even called it.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   You said you knew at time it was going to happen.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   I can't read.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   I run a very professional operation here.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.240]   Shamedy Christmas.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   So, you got that.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   I powered influence in this industry.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   I will never again.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   Is that off your iPad or is it?
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   That's off my iPad.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   I played with this last night.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   The mirroring on the iPad, it does fully mirror it, as you said.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   It's very cool.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.960]   I mean, I have to change the screen to dot by dot so that it will not try to stretch this
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   out to 16.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   You mean on your TV?
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   On my TV.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.240]   I told the TV, just take it as you're getting it.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   Don't zoom it or stretch it or anything.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   So, you get black bars on the side.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   It is, you know, it's four by three.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   I'll tell you what I played, which really looked fantastic.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   And it was this, this is going to be a 1080p game on here.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   Yeah, they're there.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   They showed a preview and the frame rate is spot on.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   Already it works.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   You can play.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   You can play.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   Yeah, play.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   But a feature edition is going to be full-tay at 1080.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   I'm talking about firemen said latest version of their real racing game, Real Racing 2, which HD,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   let me turn off the sound.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   And as you said, I think you were the one who said this is going to be a great controller.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   So I'm steering like this, but watching the big screen TV.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   Really cool.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   It's a $2 million.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   I'm sorry, go ahead, leaner.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   I'm sorry, Andy.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   They spent $2 million to develop that app.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   What?
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   Really?
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.240]   Really?
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.240]   Only.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Only.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   Why was it so expensive?
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   I have no idea.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   I'm trying to get some answers from them because this is the, you know, I thought it was all, this is the most
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   money I've ever heard of anyone spending under there.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   Yeah, $2 million.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   That's real.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   They've got a full lot.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   That's PC game territory.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   Actually, it's cheap for a PC game.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   Right.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.760]   But it does sell to show, I think, you know, this is becoming a big, a big business deal.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.840]   Well, let me think about that because how much is it?
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.360]   It's $10.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.720]   So they have to sell, you know, quite a few of them.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.560]   Although I guess they could easily sell, they could make their money back, right?
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.560]   I think so.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.400]   Well, it's funny that the other game is the big money is the big, you know, was the big
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.920]   hit really.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.120]   Firemen's that airplane game where you land in the airplane.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   So they work a deal.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.600]   But that was a, and that's a very, I guarantee they'd spend $2 million on that.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.760]   So you steer this by steering the accelerometer.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   And so when-
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   It's the gyroscope.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   Yeah, or maybe it's the gyroscope, I don't know.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.280]   But it worked on the old, it works in the old iPad.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.120]   So I'm thinking it's accelerometer.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.880]   But what's cool is this makes a lousy control if you're staring at the screen as you can
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   see.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.440]   Ah, tilted.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.720]   But if you're looking at a big screen TV, suddenly you've got a steering wheel that
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.920]   looks like a box of cornflakes.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   Yep.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.600]   I think it's interesting though.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.380]   I think it's going to actually, I tweeted about it when Real Racing released their first
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.880]   like teaser video of it.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.080]   I thought that I, my reaction was, my God, there's going to be a really interesting adaptation.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.040]   There's going to be a really interesting change to the gaming market.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.360]   And very correctly, a lot of people who are serious gamers said, well, look, you're still
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.160]   dealing with the idea that you have a controller that has a big wire sticking out of it.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.560]   And no one's going to speak seriously.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.360]   But the answer to that is that there are so many people like myself who really can't spend
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.280]   300 bucks on a console.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.560]   It's not that I don't have 300 bucks.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.400]   It's just that I don't spend that.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.240]   I'm not that involved in gaming.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.720]   I don't have friends coming over spending a good casual day.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   Right.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.040]   I would certainly, and I love games like this on my iPad.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.880]   My iPad is my gaming system.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.320]   And if you give me the ability to play high definition games on my TV, that will turn
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:51.480]   me from a guy who spends maybe $50 a year on iPad games to maybe a guy will spend $100,
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   $100 on iPad games.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.640]   The squirrel just jumped down the back of your shirt.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.280]   I just, in case you didn't notice that later, later.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.720]   But people are going to have to spend that's for that's that's that's that contents for
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.720]   premium subscribers.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.040]   Age verification required.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   I do.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.720]   I would love to see it on on airplay as opposed to having to use this cable.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.200]   Maybe there are technical limits to how high the quality of the video can be and all that.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.440]   But when that, but can you imagine like a John Madden?
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.720]   NFL game where every single player in the room has their own private display.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   Yes.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.880]   They put in their own calls and one joint display for the game play.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.280]   That's that's the point that point in which a lot of people will suddenly start to stop
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.760]   seeing the iPad as it's a great device.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.160]   And it also plays some really good games and turned into this is the game platform for
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.720]   this segment of the gaming population of the serious gamers who really need a huge display
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.280]   and all kinds of controls on it.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   That's.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.160]   Yeah, people are in the chatroom or sale.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.240]   Come on $499 plus $10 plus $40.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.800]   But nobody buys his chest to do that.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.080]   We're just saying it's kind of exactly you get it in addition.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:06.120]   That's another reason why I don't I don't own a game console because I have I have $300
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.400]   God God bless this industry.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.680]   I will make another $300 in the future.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.440]   But it's this device that I would be use it's $300 device.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.320]   I'd be using maybe an hour or two per week.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.640]   And so it just doesn't make sense.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.360]   I have I need this iPad.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   I use this iPad.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.960]   And I get a free gaming system with it.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   That's how I tend to see it.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.320]   That's how a lot of other people going to see it.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   Right.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.600]   Coolest thing to use an old iPad to do.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.240]   Let me see if I can get this link up to show you.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:42.600]   We have to translate it from some odd language Danish Danish as soon as Google finishes
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   a translation.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.240]   Apparently, it's working extra hard today.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:53.280]   The Google the Google's working a little hard on the translation.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.760]   Turn it into.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.080]   Now it's a slide show.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   I hate it when they do this.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.120]   That means I'm going to have to load each page, translate it.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.800]   Yeah, I got bored after about three slides.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.200]   Yeah, into a typewriter.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.400]   Actually, we talked about this a little bit on the daily giz was this is a real company
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.840]   that lets you use your typewriter to type on your iPad.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.160]   And I could wear my steampunk glasses while I do it.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:27.400]   So it's a USB kit that converts a traditional typewriter into a USB keyboard, which I think
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:34.880]   is a novel, not cheap, but it does work kind of crazy.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   You could put it.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.600]   You know, we've seen this one also put it in a cabinet.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.240]   Good uses for old iPad ones.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:49.040]   Tom Merritt demonstrated how if you have the case, the magnetic cover, and you could slap
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.400]   that on your refrigerator.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.960]   And the whole thing goes from.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.240]   Yeah, I'm so worried about that though.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.640]   I know we do not recommend this.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.720]   My pick of the week is actually a mounting bracket for the iPad that I actually really,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   really like.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   Okay.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.240]   But one of the things one of the most one of the modes that I went through is I've got
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   these MIT flea market.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   That's what you need.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.920]   If you've got a child that's being unruly and they're wearing like a set of coveralls
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.640]   with a metal buckle on the back, this magnet can definitely hold that child against the
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.320]   fridge for the rest of the day until she settles down.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   One word.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   Neo-dimeyum.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   Exactly.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.360]   And yet I think about I hold this love my personal iPad, the one that I personally spent
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.720]   money on, not the one that Apple loans.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.320]   And I think how upset would I be if this just suddenly went clump off the fridge and broken
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.640]   in bazillion pieces?
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.600]   And I realized, I thought back to this moment when I looked at this magnet and this glue
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.960]   holding it together and thought, Andy, I bet that could fail in some way in the future.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.440]   I think I'd feel pretty damn stupid.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   I think it was brave because Tom not only did it, once he did it on the refrigerator,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.520]   then he went on an expedition around his home to see what else he could glue it to.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.640]   I believe he glued it to the water heater.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.600]   Well, that's just that's just what happens when you buy a two but two part epoxy or hot
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   glue.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.240]   First, first, you do the thing that you're supposed to do with it.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.400]   And then once like the vase would write, it's like, I wonder if I could stick this to
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   this.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   Exactly.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   I can't remember the CD and a Lego guy on it.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   His washing machine.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.560]   He just, but you just slap it on.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   You're right.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:27.640]   I'm not sure I would recommend it as a permanent installation, but we will have a solution later.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.520]   I mean, Leander, this is, if you write a sequel to the cult of Mac, clearly you're going
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.440]   to have to add iPad to this.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440]   Oh, yeah, definitely.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.320]   Look at this guy's turn it is an iPad into a safety jacket.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.440]   He's embedded it in the back of his jacket and shows whether he's turning left, right
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   or stopping.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.400]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.880]   I don't think I own a single article of clothing or an entire suit that causes much
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   of the iPad.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.680]   Yeah, right.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   How about this?
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:02.080]   I embedded it in an old I book, you know, one of those old clam shell I books.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   It's faster.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.400]   It's higher res.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.280]   It's superior in every way.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.840]   Got more RAM.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   Wow.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   That's pretty.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   You know what?
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   That would work fine.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.840]   I think that's a clever solution.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.680]   I think WWDC.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   We mentioned this.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   It sold out one day.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.680]   They did announce it will be in San Francisco early part of June.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.240]   This is their developers conference.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   They did also announce the Apple design awards for iOS and Mac apps only.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.400]   But here's the real question.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.440]   Will they have an iPhone 5 to announce?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.440]   I'm keeping now.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   I would love to get your reaction, Lander and Andy on this.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.760]   I keep hearing rumors that in fact June will not bring us an iPhone 5.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.240]   What are you hearing, Lander?
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.920]   Yeah, the same thing that they're not going to, they're not going to update it.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   Although it's kind of conflicting.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.360]   I've heard NFC, you know, 4 inch screen.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.040]   There's been so many rumors that they are going to do something.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.720]   But then there's been a lot of counter rumors, but they're not going to do anything at all.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   This is Josh Wontzak.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:11.480]   Paul Skis apparently still writing an Engadget saying they just, you know, all the suppliers
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.120]   are saying they haven't ordered parts yet.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.760]   I guess if you would make sense if you're a Verizon customer, you'd like them not to
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   ship a new iPhone so soon.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   Right.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   So the iPhone 5 is just a white iPhone as well coming out pretty shortly, which doesn't make
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.280]   any sense if they're going to update the hardware.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.680]   Wait a minute, say that again?
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.960]   Well, the white iPhone 2, the white iPhone 4.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.160]   Oh, they're really on track.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   You're kidding.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   No.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.400]   This is what Phil Schiller said this a couple of months ago that it was going to be the
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   spring.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.200]   So maybe the iPhone 5 is just a white iPhone 4.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.800]   Well, it makes sense because I think Apple's always had this problem.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.160]   You know, they update their hardware too quickly.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.400]   And just as they get the production lines up and running to full steam, they go ahead
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.720]   and rip them down and put up something new.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   So they tend to, you know, they need at least two years, I think, to get their money's worth
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   out of a number of years.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   Well, two years.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.920]   It does make sense in the sense that that's how long your contract is with your carrier.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.720]   So you can get a new iPhone every two years for 200 bucks.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.880]   And you could jump carriers if you wanted to.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.920]   But that's not what they did in 2007, '89.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.120]   I mean, don't you think a lot of people expect to?
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.880]   The new iPhone and will be disappointed?
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.880]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.600]   I think people are going to be just going to be riots in the streets.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.760]   There's going to be people to expect part of it.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.760]   It's a given, isn't it?
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:36.080]   First Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, and now Yemen and now San Francisco.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.580]   You agree?
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.080]   I'm not really sure.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.760]   I haven't heard anything specific about the lack of new hardware.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:50.680]   It would be less of a surprise than simply a difference from what everybody's expecting.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.120]   But all the information comes from places that you can read.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:01.160]   Jim Dallerimple, I do read the loop as often as it updates on Google Reader.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.240]   And so when he says something like that, that certainly is an interesting data point to
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   me.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   Do you think they're credible?
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.440]   I mean, Jim's credible, right?
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.480]   I like that the loop has a pretty good track record by my site.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.280]   But the other thing that I find more interesting, this isn't something that I've seen written
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.200]   elsewhere, is that it's possible that Apple knows that they already have a pretty hefty
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.320]   plate of things to show off for WWDC.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.600]   And it's possible that they're just saying, do we really want to spend 45 minutes showing
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.440]   off a new phone?
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.240]   Especially considering that we really want everybody's attention on the fact that we
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.440]   have, now that Mac OS and iOS aren't merging, but they're becoming a lot more intimate
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.520]   and connected with what one can do with the other.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.960]   Don't we want the focus to be on the idea that we are bored, we are one, resistance
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   is futile.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.640]   When we could just simply kick out a release for a new iPhone the next week, the week after
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.120]   that, hold a special event and handle it there.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:02.560]   This raises an issue that I thought I would talk about today and certainly be something
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.800]   that I would love to hear your guys' opinion on.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.960]   I think it's time for Apple to declare victory.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.440]   Get a parade?
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:18.520]   I mean, seriously, not shipping an iPhone 5 would be that kind of a declaration like,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.560]   hey, we don't need to give you a new iPhone.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.560]   What's wrong with the old one?
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.080]   We got an iPad 2, we got an iPhone 5, we got the MacBooks, we got the MacBook care.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.880]   Or are they going to say, come on, big for it, big for it.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:36.120]   Come on, jump, say on this right here, iPhone 5 larger screen, 4G, jump for it, jump for
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   it.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:42.440]   I think that this point they can say, we won.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.920]   I mean, Microsoft?
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   No.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:51.280]   Look at the problems Microsoft's already having with Windows Phone 7.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   Look at the other tablets.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.240]   The Zoom, I saw the Zoom yesterday in Costco.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.240]   Not exactly a line.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.240]   Yeah, I know about it.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.760]   This is why Apple, you know, is so special.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.480]   This is why Apple stays ahead because they're always so paranoid about getting their asses
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.560]   kicked by somebody else.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.320]   They're always their own faces competitive.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.840]   So, so they never wrestle on their lowers with the iPod.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   True.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   They have now.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   It got to be.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.280]   Come on, the Laurel resting has begun with the iPod.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.560]   Well, it switched to the iOS is now that that's a screen device.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.640]   Yeah, they won in the iPod.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   So they said, okay.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.600]   But, you know, they came out with a much, much better to put solution than the iPod.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.720]   I mean, they could have been churning out, you know, higher capacities, bigger and bigger
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.200]   and bigger hard drugs forever.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   The white bother exactly.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.520]   So they've come out with the iOS, you know, the iPhone, the iPod touch.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.800]   I think there's even rumors that the classics done.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.720]   I mean, they're not going to even do a, you know, this was the only way you can get a
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.240]   160 gig iPod nights and white and bother.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.360]   They haven't updated it in two years.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.560]   It's, I think there's something to what Leander is saying because I can't remember the last
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:55.760]   time that Apple released as defensive, a commercial as the new string of commercials for the iPhone,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.040]   where they have to say, do you want to read books?
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.680]   Do you want to listen to music?
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.880]   Well, you'd better have an iPhone.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.520]   And even people who really like Apple, like me, are saying, yeah, here's an Android phone
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.840]   that has all of those things.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:14.200]   And also, I mean, this is the new phone, Verizon's new HTC Thunderbolt.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.440]   And it might be the, it's probably the first Android phone where I could definitely see
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.600]   myself, if I had a choice between an iPhone and an Android phone, I would be very, very
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.960]   tempted by this phone.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.200]   I would still go with the iPhone, but that would be chiefly because of its app store.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.200]   But this is, it's responsive.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   It works nicely.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   What is that?
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   Is that the new Sprint one?
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   That's the one from Verizon.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   Verizon is the Thunderbolt.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.000]   It's the Thunderbolt, right?
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.480]   And chiefly, I got it so I could check out three G, four G speeds.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.320]   But it's a, I, I, the more I use these larger screen phones, the more enamored I get from
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   them.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   I get it.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   You're finally coming around, Mr. Naco.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.120]   I've been saying that for months.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.960]   Well, the Android still kind of sucked as a consumer device.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.920]   And it's still, and you still have Android X.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.680]   I love that phone until it was lost in a cab somewhere and somewhere I can't remember
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   even more.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.680]   All right, let's take what you said.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   You mentioned the new ads.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.040]   Let's show you the new iPhone ads.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:10.320]   If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have the app store.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   This is a defensive app.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:18.040]   The world's largest selection of apps that are this easy to find and this easy to download
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   right to your phone.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   They're specifically addressing how to do it.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.880]   So it can be almost anything like a boarding pass.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   Of course, they did that with the Switch campaign, didn't they?
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.480]   Like, pay for your coffee.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   Yep.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.880]   If you don't have an iPhone, well, remember, you don't have an iPhone.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.840]   I can't remember one that was that really made me just sit back and say, oh, that was kind
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.240]   of a mistake.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.480]   That one is partially the sort of thing I'm talking about.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.280]   But I'm talking more about the one that says if you don't have an iPhone, you don't have
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   an iPhone.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   You don't have an iPhone.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   Let me find that one for you.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.440]   So the iPod and iTunes one, let's look at this one here.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.960]   I just like showing Apple ads.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   You're still a little produced.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.120]   You don't have an iPod in your phone.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.120]   Is this the one you mean?
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:09.440]   With your music and your playlists and you don't have iTunes on your phone, the world's
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:18.120]   number one music store with genius that recommends new music based on the songs you already have.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.000]   Yep.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.600]   If you don't have an iPhone, well, you don't have an iPhone.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.480]   Well, you're saying that the response to that could be Amazon saying you don't have
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.680]   cloud storage.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   You don't have.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   Let's see.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:36.360]   The difficulty in a commercial like that is that you're not to Apple has would have
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.120]   necessarily a hard time explaining the truth of why iPhones are so good.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   They're well integrated.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.120]   They're well designed.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.360]   They're very humanly produced.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.600]   But it's hard to show that.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.760]   It's hard to come up with examples.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:51.000]   But when you do a commercial like that, all someone has to do is even without knowledge
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   of the Amazon store.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.400]   So let's say if Amazon comes on and says if you don't, if you have an iPhone, you don't
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   have access.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.680]   You don't have direct access to the Amazon MP3 store where you can stream all of your
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.240]   purchases without having to do anything.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   Right.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   You also don't have the direct access to the Kindle store, whether the largest online library
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   of digital products.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   And this is something I've been saying for a long time, which is that on feature by feature
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.680]   basis, it's very difficult to compete with Android.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.880]   You end up resorting to the aesthetic objective.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.240]   But it's not as though aesthetic is a bad thing.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.640]   No, no, I'm not saying that, but it's hard to demonstrate.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.120]   You can't compare anything from a bullet.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.080]   You can't make a buying choice based on a bullet chart and simply says, well, this
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   has a 5-megapixel camera.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   I can.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   It's a big pixel camera.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   This one's better.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   Well, lots of nerds do, don't they?
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.320]   And I think this is actually quite an interesting example of Apple trying to show the features,
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   which they haven't done for years.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:48.640]   From the IMA/Mac/AMMA PC ads, which were, I guess, the closest thing you could do to
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.040]   talking about the virtues of the Mac compared to the PC, they went that specific.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:58.000]   It was things like viruses and ease of use and having no IT headaches.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.240]   This is the first time I've seen an ad from Apple that gets into the specific features
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.640]   of the product for a long time.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.000]   Does that mean they're scared?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I don't know.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.160]   I think, and it's right, it's a little bit defensive, but it's also a pretty good, they're
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.960]   reinforcing this message that is a device.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.760]   You hit two buttons and it's instantly transformed into a completely different device.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.800]   It can be a musical instrument, it can be a game console, it can be a productivity machine.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.960]   The great thing about Apple is that we can have this speculation.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.200]   You can't have this kind of speculation about a Microsoft ad because it's clearly some monkey
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.760]   through a darted aboard and they said, this is our strategy today.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.240]   But Apple's very careful, very strategic.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.040]   If they're doing an ad that touts features of an iPhone, there's a reason.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:49.960]   I think you're rightly under that they've decided it's time to talk about this.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.800]   They're definitely getting some heat from all sides.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:59.640]   Amazon is presenting a credible challenge in the media area and Google too.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   It says some of the Google hardware is beautiful.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.320]   These new Android phones are really, really nice devices.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.040]   Steve Jobs said these big screens are like hummus in your pocket.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.040]   They do really great.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   They're not.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.040]   I love them.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   They're really nice.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   That's kind of silly.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.160]   Here's my iPhone and here's the Thunderbolt.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:24.120]   If you can't deal with a device that's this much larger, especially when you consider that
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.760]   it makes it so much cooler to be able to when you're reading books with it and in gameplay.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.120]   This is practically nothing.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.320]   I don't have a single shirt pocket that is too wide for this, but now we're enough for
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.320]   this.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   That's why I don't have to say that.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.560]   We've got a hard time switching screen sizes now though because of all the apps that are
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   made.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.760]   Yeah, and Apple's been saying, "Oh, fragmentation, fragmentation."
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   They can't.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.520]   It's a tricky thing.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.520]   You start saying things like that and then when the time comes that you would like to
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.400]   do some different screen sizes, it's going to come out.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.720]   It's coming out to the point now where they're going to have to start to differentiate the
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   hardware.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.600]   I think all this talk about the iPhone Nano.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:08.280]   It's a smaller, cheaper, less feature-rich iPhone for a lesser price.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   They talked about the Nano.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.960]   I don't think it's going to be a smaller screen size, but it's going to be cheaper iPod.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.960]   Yeah, it's a 3GS.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.680]   Actually, they're selling a 3GS right now.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   Pretty cheap.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680]   49 bucks.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   In a way, that's the Nano.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.760]   They're advertising that too, aren't they?
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:26.280]   I'm just going to say, Andy, that I've been trying to get you to switch to Android for
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.240]   a long time.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.600]   Now you say it and everybody's going, "Oh, it's time."
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   "Oh, no, no, no.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.080]   I'm not saying it's time to switch.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.360]   I'm saying that it took a number of years for Android to, in my eye, become a real credible
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.040]   choice.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.200]   Even now, it's not a case where the same user could make that same decision, either go Apple
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.200]   or go Android.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.440]   I'm saying that if you're the sort of user for whom a huge variety or even a wide variety
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:53:00.120]   of high quality apps isn't a motivating factor, that releases you from, that gives you a lot
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.240]   more options in Android because that's always going to be the weakness.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.320]   If you really are a, "I need the email, I need a web browser, I need to make and receive
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.600]   telephone calls, and I need three or four core apps, including I want a good book reader."
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.760]   There's a lot of stuff in those five simple categories available for Android, and there's
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.320]   some advantages to Android.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.880]   If there's, my top three things that I wish that Apple would add to the iPhone that I
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.800]   love on the Android is, it would be just an alternative keyboard.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   I love swipes.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   Swipe is fantastic.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.040]   Because I can just blaze through text on swipe.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:41.920]   With the iPhone, I'm still, I'm pretty fast-typed, but gosh, if I've been spending a day, like
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:47.720]   a deep immersive test mode on the Android, I've been sending 9, 10, 11 emails just by
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.040]   going, "Hollow, how are you doing today?"
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.760]   I was wondering if you got that one I said.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   When will you discover when I get back to H-E-L?
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   No.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.760]   When will you?
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.760]   Oh, I can't.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   Every time I go back to the iPhone, it's painful.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   When will you start dictating stuff?
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   It's the dictations I made.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.200]   But that's my attitude.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   That's not my goal here.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   [inaudible]
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   I'm the one.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   Two times in my life.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:15.600]   I was testing turn-by-turn navigation.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.920]   Only two times in my life, I got so furious, I ripped the phone out of the mount and threw
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.080]   it on the path to get it to shut it.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.680]   It was just, I was actually having, I'm not trying to be funny here.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.560]   It was actually giving me pain in my head.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.640]   The voice was so bad and so grating.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.960]   I have to say, motion X GPS.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.440]   King of the Hill, King of the Hill.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:41.200]   Now, okay, so I started this by saying time for Apple to declare victory apparently not.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.800]   I also don't think that Apple's a sort of, they have a reputation for being arrogant,
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.760]   but they always have, they don't define themselves by what other people are doing to say that
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.240]   we've declared victory would be just for them to say that we deeply profoundly cared about
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.040]   what other companies we're doing.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.240]   We measure ourselves by how much better we are than an Android phone, by Windows mobile
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.280]   phone, by a Palm pre.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.120]   And that's, I don't think that's the truth at all.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.280]   This is, but the 2011 is going to be Apple's year.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.880]   I think it's pretty clear again.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.080]   I think they get the clear victory.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.880]   That is my thought.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:18.440]   I think 2011 is the year that Google's team decided, oh, wait a minute, you're supposed
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.760]   to hold the bat by the skinny end.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:26.160]   I think, I think we want to see Steve Jobs come on stage with a big mission accomplished
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   banner.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:32.080]   I'm just saying, I'm just saying, yeah, I hope we see on a aircraft carrier.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.280]   Now is the time to fly in and on a helicopter.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.520]   Steve, if you ever wanted to, all right, we're going to take a break.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.120]   When we, when we come back, uh, Captain Neil will join us.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.080]   He's got a big boat Steve could use.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.360]   It's not an aircraft carrier, but it's pretty big boat.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:54.720]   I was going to say, I would like to see like the Richard, the Richard Branson photo.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.800]   I think the Steve Jobs could definitely do that.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   I think so.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:03.000]   The one, the one where he earned the love of everybody who might not have liked him that,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.520]   you know what, if I were a billionaire, I would have my picture taken.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.840]   Water skiing behind a super boat while a naked super model is holding his thing into my bag.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.240]   That was a good picture.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.040]   I cannot begrudge him for doing that.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.960]   That's kind of awesome.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.680]   Captain Neil joins us more news too and your picks of the week as well.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.080]   But first I want to mention our pick for eliminating business travel.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   Go to meeting.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.440]   I've already had this week.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.440]   It's Tuesday.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.760]   I've already had three go to meeting meetings.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.800]   I love go to meeting.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.000]   It eliminates the need to travel.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   You can meet.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.480]   You can save time, save money, save stress.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.840]   You don't have to, you don't, I mean, business trips just kill me because I have to, I have
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.920]   shows to do folks.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.520]   I can't, I can't be getting on an airplane.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.560]   So for sales presentations, for product demos, for training sessions, collaboration, we've
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.040]   been doing a lot of meeting over the new studio.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.040]   Go to meeting amazing.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.440]   I want you to try it free right now.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.920]   Just go to go to meeting.com/macbreak 30 days free.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.640]   Very easy to stall Mac or PC.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.960]   So you know, it's a true cross platform solution.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.480]   So you put it on your Mac.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.160]   You can, you know, send an email.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.400]   It has a link to the meeting.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:16.000]   By the way, has built in VoIP or telephone conferencing.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.560]   So when you set up the meeting, you're also setting up a conference call, a conference
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.200]   bridge is set up with a phone number, a login.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.440]   But when you're, you kind of try this.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.440]   It's so cool.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.440]   Let me see if I can describe it.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.920]   So I'm setting up a meeting.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.960]   I say we're going to meet, you know, this time this day.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   Email goes out.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.520]   Now my client, now they made me don't have anything installed.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.720]   So I don't want to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.720]   No problem.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   They have that email in front of them.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.960]   So I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   I'm going to make them jump through hoops.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   They can use the built-in speaker and headphone.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.960]   They don't need to make a phone call.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.960]   Suddenly, they're seeing your screen.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   You're talking with them.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   You're presenting to them.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   It's very easy for them.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   It is an amazing way to collaborate, to present, to train.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   The more I use it, the more I appreciate it.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   It has just saved us a lot of time.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.960]   I have to say a lot of money.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   I want you to try it free.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.960]   30 days.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   Visit go-to-meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   We thank them for their support.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   Go to meeting from our good friends at Citrix.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Let me see if Captain Neal's on the line.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Neal, are you there?
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   I am, Leo.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   I love it.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   Neal Bauman, who is the cruise director, the guy in charge.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   That's a good title.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   Cruise director is flying.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   You started this.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   When was the first Macmania?
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   I believe 2001.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.960]   I think it was...
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   Ten years ago.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   Memorial Day.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   I think.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   You're going to have a celebration.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.960]   Did you have any idea what this would become?
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   No, not really.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   On the one hand, on the other hand, my cruises had right from the start had attracted over
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   100 people.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   It seemed to me that there was this interest in hanging out and extending the Mac world
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   parties.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   That's kind of what it was.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   It was like a floating Mac world.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   I think so.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   A little more intense on the hanging with people side.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   On the one hand, on the other hand, it wasn't nearly as many.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   But wait a minute.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   Now, you typically...
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   I know Andy's done this.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   You typically will have four or five lecturers in a bunch of different areas.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.960]   Andy's done all sorts of topics.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   Give me some of the topics, Andy, that you've done on a Macmania cruise.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   I did a day long on Mac OS morning, four hours in the morning on basics, four hours in the
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   morning.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.240]   I've done, when my favorite ones was a couple hours, just saying, here are all the really
[00:59:55.240 --> 01:00:00.400]   great free things that you get with the Mac OS that you haven't used before and the commercial
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.960]   equivalent so you don't really need if you're going to have these apps.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   Every time I give a talk, there might be...
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:11.560]   If I talk for 12 or 13 or 14 hours, there'll be a couple hours, two or three hours of things
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   I might have done before.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.520]   But it's always, gee, what's new this year?
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.640]   What can I talk about this year?
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.840]   And there's always a really great group of people there that I know is there...
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.440]   I know it's there there to listen.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.400]   And also the other advantage is that shipboard, like the onboard ship, you don't get Wi-Fi
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400]   everywhere.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.320]   So it's one of the few places where you give a talk where you know the people aren't going
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   to be just like, have their heads down on their screens.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.600]   They're actually going to be paying attention to you because you're the only live thing
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   in that place.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   Although I have to say, they've gotten better with the internet access.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.160]   Isn't it amazing they sure have.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160]   Yeah, they've really improved it.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.360]   And you know, this river cruise we're doing a year from next month, free Wi-Fi on the entire
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   ship.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   It's interesting.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.560]   That's because you're not very far from land.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.560]   You're in a river.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   That's correct.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.560]   That's correct.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   So it's a little easier to do.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.560]   A little less expensive, right?
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   Not a satellite link.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.160]   Yeah, on a boat they have to use a marine satellite system to...
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.160]   That's a cruise ship out the ocean.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.160]   So you got...
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.120]   I wanted to bring you on to give you a chance to do some plug-in because you've got a couple
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120]   of cruises coming up.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.360]   I know there are a lot of Mac listeners.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.760]   If you've never done a Mac Mania cruise, go to InsightCruises.com.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.560]   GeekCruises.com still works.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.560]   Indeed.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.440]   These cruises are so much fun.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   They really are.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   I love them.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.040]   It's hard to describe the fun.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.960]   The Mac world is sort of an inkling of what it's like.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:33.360]   It's just this large collection of people that are just so heavily into their devices.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   Right.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.160]   And the applications.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.880]   And in the community aspect, they're looking to share and exchange information.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.760]   But unlike a Mac world, the speakers are walking around.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.800]   The speakers are really part of the community as well on these things.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   That's what I like.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800]   I get to meet so many people.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.200]   And really, it's a social event.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.200]   You...
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   I see you doing a...
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   You're doing a quilting cruise?
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.000]   We have to bring that up.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.480]   He does Scientific American.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   He does astronomy cruises.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.280]   You're going to do a solar eclipse cruise to Australia next year in November.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.800]   But you did Pearl World.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.600]   You did Linux cruises.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   You're also doing...
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.600]   I went on a chess cruise.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   It was great.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.600]   But quilting?
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.600]   Quilting.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.000]   Well, this is my partner, Skye and Telescope.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   They own a collection of magazines.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   Ah.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   And one of which is Fontanporters Quilting.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.800]   So they asked us to do this.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.000]   And if an interesting cruise, we take over the meeting room and put in sewing machines.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   I mean, you make quilts.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Exactly.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   They do a nickel.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   That's why you're going to Alaska.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   It wouldn't be really great to go to the Bahamas.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   I remember.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   In international waters, the child labor...
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Child labor laws were...
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Child labor laws were...
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   The peace work do not apply.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Not apply.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Bring the kids.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   So let's plug the Mac mania.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   The first one is Mac mania 12.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   That's right.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   You're getting out of order now.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   You used to do one a year.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   Eleven was in 2011.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Twelve is so...
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   Well, you actually...
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   We did at 2.5 and at 3.5.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   Right.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   I'm not mistaken.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Right.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   You're limiting the point.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   You're limiting the point.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   You're a little bit out of order.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   So it sort of...
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   You know, it sort of...
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   They ebb and flow.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   They go when it appears we can take advantage of a good cruise and a good location.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   Now this one, I would love it.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   I don't know if you've got an excursion to the...
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Cottage, but I know San Francisco is on the itinerary.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   You're going Vancouver down the coast, down the west coast.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   That's right.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Well, we'd love to stop in on the cottage.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I think that that must be on your itinerary.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   We'll do it.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   It's coming up February...
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   I'm sorry, September 9th through the 19th.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   10 day cruise down the Pacific coast.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   David Pogo will be on it.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Randall Schwartz.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   Sal, who's always the greatest.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   He is always fabulous.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   He is the...
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   Apple script and Automator Guy.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   Apple...
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   I'm not supposed to say...
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   They only said, "Don't say Sal's name out loud."
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   But...
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Never mind what I just said.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   Rob, we do Mac break week.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   We only come on Tuesday.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   Yes.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Because we're going to be in San Francisco, I guess, Wednesday, Thursday.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Well, come Wednesday.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   You could watch the Google show.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   Okay.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Or Thursday.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   You could do the iPad show.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   We'll figure it out.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   By then, we'll be in the new studio.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   There'll be plenty of space.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Typically, there's around 100 Mac fanatics, plus...
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   And then you add spouses and other family members.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   So, it's really a lot of fun.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   And in this case, you're going to get to go from Vancouver to...
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   And then I'm O in Washington, Victoria, Seattle, San Francisco, Monterey,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Catalina and San Diego.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Sounds like a wonderful cruise.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Yeah, these are some places you typically do not go on a cruise.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   Monterey Bay.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   That was fun.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   It's even not that easy to get to.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   I guess people fly into Santa saying, "Get down."
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   But it's not a well-trafficked tourist place.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   And you know, this is a fairly affordable cruise.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   It starts at $1,000 for the cruise.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   And then, what is it?
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   $850 for the conference?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   It's $10.95 for the conference.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   $10.95 for the conference, because it's a 10-day conference.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   So, you're going to learn so much here.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   And it's so much fun.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   And these guys are great, obviously.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Yeah, and a wine cruise that goes along with it.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   You know, interestingly, they are the cruise line itself is running a wine cruise the entire event.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   So, they'll be wine-tasting every day.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   Nothing like a bunch of drunk Mac fans.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   I tell you, it's fun.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   On a boat.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   On a boat.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   I'm on a boat.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Then, of course, we have to talk about Mac 12, Mac 14.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   This one, I really wanted to go on.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   I was planning on going on, and my schedule is so up in the air.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   I can't plan ahead.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   I can understand.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   I would love to do this one, though.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   This was the cruise of a lifetime.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   It's Rhine River and the Moselle region.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   Well, not only the cruise, but the tourist is to turn.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   The tour to the Max Planck Institute.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   And these are the just civilians cannot go.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   I really, really like to go.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   This one's booking up fast, though, so don't delay.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   It is actually this retritoring the whole boat.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   And it's a small ship.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   It's 75 cabins.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   And we have 40 cabins filled.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   50 cabins filled now.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Wow.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   So, wait a minute.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   You said how many... you have 75 cabins, so you're almost there.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   Correct.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   Two thirds is sold.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   Now, this one you can save up for, it's not until April 2012.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   So, you have a year to save up for this one.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   And what a great trip this is going to be.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   At the start in Paris or Amsterdam and you end in Paris.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   Now, that's all I need to say probably.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   I would think so.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Neil, I think what you're doing is so good.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   I just wanted to give you a free plug in here.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   I've had so much fun on these Mac mania cruises.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   I've been on five or six of them.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   And we hope to have you back, of course.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   I will come back.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   I know I will.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   And you've got to get Leander and Andy on back again, too.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Maybe we do a Mac break weekly cruise.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   I would like to do that sometime.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   You know, you might be able to broadcast.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   The riverboat.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   The riverboat maybe.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   You know, you guys produced the Jonathan Colton cruise.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   Yes, we did.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   And that was like Jonathan Colton, Hodgman.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   You had 380 or so people on that.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Amazing.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   They didn't do any broadcasting from there.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   No, but we should do something like that.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   I'll talk to you, Neil.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   You know, I'm coming up actually in a month or so.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Good.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   So I'll make an appointment and we'll come.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   We'll set up the grill because he's a king of the grill.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   I would love to grill.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Of course.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Oh, like a matter of fact, I was thinking when the Mac group hits the cottage.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   In September, I can actually cook for the grill.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   We will set you up.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   We'll have a grill set up and we'll.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   We need a massive grill.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   A massive grill.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Right.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   Okay.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   We won't have a backyard anymore, but I'm sure we can do something.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Oh, we have an alley.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   We'll put you in telephone alley.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   Oh, he felt great.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   You know, all I needed was a cigar and I'm set.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Neil, Vama, great to talk to you.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Neil, great to talk to you.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   Thank you, David.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   Thank you again.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Always do.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Andy did a ukulele concert on one of those.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   I will never forget.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Yeah, Chris.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Chris Brain, which who is not only the Mac expert, but also on hell of a musician.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   And that was one where he also had the virus.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   We also had was we had a band.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   That was a pretty awesome.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   It's so it's I think I should speak to a serious segment of the listenership who would think I would never that they would never ever want to go on a cruise and enjoy because that's exactly what I thought about it.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Like the first time I was I was invited one of these things because you know, that's just not my kind of group.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   But man, it is so much fun when you're there with a group of 70, 80, 90, 100 people who are also who are all your kind of people like, you know, Mac guys who are interested.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   You're going to these really fun places where it's I there are really great places in in Eastern Mexico and Central America there that they're lovely, but I probably would not fly all the way down to to go to Costa Rica just for the day myself.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   But you get you spend three or four days hitting all these other cities doing all it's just a lot of I got to go to match a Pichu last time.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   I mean, incredible, incredible.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   I would I was able to add China's Korea and Japan to my life list.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   Yes.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   On one cruise a couple years ago and it's like my God what what like what kind of what how what other time would I be able to spend like 10 days just having really good experiences in each one of these countries except for and also again hanging out with cool people.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   And having and having basically all all you can eat buffet 24 days.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   That's also a selling point.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   It is a selling point, but I to me it really is.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I'm not you know, I would have I like boats and I like cruising, but this is nice because it's in you pour your pouring stuff into your brain at the same time and even those of us lecture we learn a lot.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Oh, actually.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   All the great stuff that I know about aperture and about Photoshop I've learned because I have attended other people.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   Absolutely.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   Absolutely.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   Really amazing stuff.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   Let's see.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   We got a 10th anniversary story, not just of the of the Macmania cruise of geek cruises, but of OS 10.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   It when was Lander.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   What is the what is the official birthday of OS 10?
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   March 24th, 2000 and one five days five days ago, 10 years ago.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Wow.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   It was in public beta before that, but that was the official launch date for the public.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   And you know what's interesting about OS 10?
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   It hasn't.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   Unless my memory is completely wrong changed a huge amount, has it?
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   From its.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   I think so.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   Look at the look at the look at the mail app for one thing.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Look at the finder.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   Look at the they went through.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   They go through like this.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   The chrome, the third change in background.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   They went through after starting off with Aqua.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   It was a Aqua then the brushed steel.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Oh, that's right.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   So this is the this is from a Landers article at cult of Mac.com an image of OS 10 version
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.400]   one.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.000]   What cat was that?
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   That cheetah?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   I mean, good.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Yeah, it was.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   It was.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   They didn't actually declare the cat until it was like.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   Oh, it was.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.600]   I mean, they're always internal names, but they didn't bring them to the forefront and use
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.000]   them as public product names until I think it's 10.3 10.2.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   I think this was the one that Steve Jobs said you could lick.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   It was water droplets.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   It was so good you could lick them in.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   Yeah, water droplets.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   It was it was beautiful for the time.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   It was a huge, huge leap forward.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   I mean, if you remember Windows at the time and Mac OS 9.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   Well, it needed to because OS 9 was very by then was really behind what what Microsoft
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   was doing with operating systems.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   It didn't have memory management.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   You crash an app and OS 9.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   You crash the whole system.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   Microsoft was well ahead of that by 2000.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.560]   It had Windows 2000 in fact, which was much more robust and had real memory management
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.440]   and, you know, real task switching.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.680]   So they needed this.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.200]   They got OS 10 when when they got Steve Jobs.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:59.640]   It really is based on next step later open step, the next operating system and Avi Tivanian
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.720]   came along from next and really spearheaded development.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.120]   This was, you know, Unix.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.400]   It was based on BSD.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.520]   It had that great Aqua interface.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:18.760]   Next step used used the open PDF description for the for the screen and this used quartz,
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.200]   but they were very, very similar.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.680]   It really that this is an example of hiring the right guy.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.800]   Steve Jobs who came along happened to come along with an operating system that was ready
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.120]   to go.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.080]   Remember pink?
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.920]   This was this is what Apple wanted to do was they were doing a joint venture with IBM
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.720]   for their next generation operating system.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.400]   I think was Gil Amelia or Michael Spindler that started pink.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.560]   That was a flop.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.040]   They needed this badly.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.320]   Yeah, pink Dylan Rhapsody Sonata.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.960]   I think yeah, I think that it was Gil Amelia though that made the decision.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.280]   But I think it was Gil Amelia that made the decision instead of they were looking at,
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.240]   I remember Jean-Louis saying they were going to buy BOS.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.400]   It was between BOS and neck and and and and hiring Steve Jobs.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.720]   And it was Gil Amelia who said, let's go with jobs and absolutely the right decision.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.240]   Although I love BOS.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   I don't know.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.000]   Can you say what life would have been like had it been BOS?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   I don't know.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.760]   I think that was an episode of fringe.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.200]   It is kind of an alternate historic universe.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.720]   Anyway, happy birthday, OS 10.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.320]   No doubt about it.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.920]   Just the best operating system ever designed.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.160]   It depends so much now as well what Apple does, you know, from the Apple TV to iOS.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.160]   Right.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.920]   It was the foundation for a whole lot of things afterwards.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:44.000]   Are you of the opinion iOS really is OS 10 under the hood?
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.560]   I mean, I know they say it is.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.320]   I don't see how good a clue.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.320]   I guess it is.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.760]   I think they used a lot of this in core technologies.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.960]   You know, Apple was always good at that.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.200]   It was, you know, taking even the iPod, you know, was using a lot of the sort of hardware
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.600]   expertise they had from the making portables.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:08.240]   Steve says, no interest in an iPhone radiation measure application.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.520]   If this if you're right about that.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.920]   That's I don't know.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.520]   That would have been the, you know, there's there.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.640]   There are two ways to really get yourself hated by a lot of people.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   One is to sell a padded bra for eight year old girls.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.120]   Another would be to sell a commercial app that tries to exploit people's fear about
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.120]   radiation.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   Oh, so you think?
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.120]   Okay.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.120]   So that makes sense.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.640]   There's an unfounded fear of your phone that that this application takes advantage of as
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:40.760]   opposed to, see, I interpret it as well, this is valuable consumer information that Apple
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   doesn't want you to know about.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   But I think that makes sense.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   If you say that there that's just it's just taking advantage of your fear, then that makes
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   sense.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   I think so.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   Lander.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:54.560]   I think, you know, if you're Steve Jobs, you don't want to radiation me to a new iPhone.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560]   Well, that's what I'm thinking.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.800]   It's not a good idea.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.600]   Maybe a consumer would.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.200]   Well, this argument goes back for what?
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.720]   Thirty years now.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.440]   And like Andy says, there's a lot of fear.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.200]   There's a lot of tin hot, tin foil hot fear about radiation from your iPhone, but there's
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.480]   absolutely no, or from any phone, so any cell phone.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.840]   But there's no, you know, it's like people being in front of their smart meters that
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.920]   they're trying to put in here in California now.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:24.680]   So Gil Friedlander, who is the founder of the company, TalkOn, that made this app sent
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.400]   Steve Jobs an email or a mail, it said, you know, it's a startup that's been working
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.760]   for the last 20 months on a patent-pending mobile application, allowing users to see
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.400]   the level of radiation they're exposed to from their mobile phone.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.680]   I don't know how they would measure that actually.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.040]   We're not approved for the app store.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.520]   We had very constructive dialogue with an Apple employee and his team were hoping they
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.880]   required APIs will be added to the iPhone SDK.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.960]   Oh, I see.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.720]   So there's a missing API that they take advantage of.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.520]   He says, please approve TalkOn for the iPhone.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:00.480]   And Steve's terse response, according to Gil, no interest.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.280]   No interest.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.600]   I guess you're right, Andy.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.560]   You know, I took the, I took, of course, because I'm an Apple hater.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.840]   I took the point of view that this was, they just didn't want bad publicity.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.760]   What if there is radiation coming from the iPhone, but you make a good point that it
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.040]   really, this is bogus, it's been, you know, there's really no evidence that there's any
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.440]   damage from radiation from phones.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   Although it'd be kind of interesting to see.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.440]   I haven't looked into this.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.840]   I wonder if they've thrown, submitted a book application that talk about the link between
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.160]   the, I'm going to, for listeners, I'm putting really sarcastic air quotes around this.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.600]   The connection between vaccines and the rise of autism in children.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600]   Would they sell that?
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.160]   It was provably idiocy.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.600]   Would they allow that through on the basis of, well, I know it's, there's no basis for
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.960]   this, but should we be evaluating whether or not people should be thinking about this
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   or not?
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.400]   And, and, and let's also acknowledge that I don't think there's any way an app could
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.720]   measure the radiation.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.640]   So it would be just a guest saying, well, we know there's this much radiation coming
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   from the iPhone.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.400]   So multiply that by the amount of time you've had it on.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.640]   And that's the radiation we're guessing.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.280]   Yeah, I guess it would be a pretty bogus app.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:15.640]   Barron's magazine says, Steve Jobs is without a doubt the most valuable CEO in the world.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.880]   Okay.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.880]   Nobody's going to gainsay that.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.200]   A shoe 13.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.200]   Next.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:33.320]   Um, lion, are we almost, are, are we going to get lion eyes soon?
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.680]   Leander, what do your sources tell you?
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.560]   Uh, yeah, it's going to be a WWDC.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.880]   You know, they'll have a, they'll have a fairly developed finished gold master then, although
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.240]   there's been rumors about a gold master out already, but that can't be true.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.920]   Uh, the other gold master at WWDC and then it'll be released in the fall.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.840]   Uh, you know, developers have had a time to, to, um, to code their apps for it.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840]   Fall.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840]   Okay.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.440]   So fall, you know, it's going to be, it's going to be rolled up for the developers first.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440]   Right.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.080]   But gold master, it's, it's kind of mostly, it's almost done.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.320]   So you think they'll have it by June?
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320]   Yeah, they'll show it off then.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.920]   And you know, maybe, maybe the end of July, I don't know, early August.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.640]   I'll tell you what, we will, uh, you know, the thing they do at WWDC is a little tricky
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   for us.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.360]   They allow a journalist into the keynote so you can cover the keynote and then they,
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.520]   they show you out and they have sessions for the developers, but the developers are
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.880]   enjoying from sharing that with journalists there under non-disclosure agreement.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:34.880]   Um, so while lots of information will leak out after WWDC, we can't directly cover it
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.040]   and give you that information.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.800]   But after it leaks out, we'll tell you what, what, what we know.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800]   It has a leak out.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.800]   Join the show.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   It doesn't take long.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   It doesn't take long.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:48.560]   Yeah, that's why you'll hear a lot of people, a lot of people, especially people who are
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:54.280]   like journalists, start saying, according to a published report on apple insider.com.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.880]   And then, right, because, you know, things you can't talk about, but you can say that
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.600]   apple insider definitely talked about this and selectively decided, yes, I think I'll
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.400]   pass this one along.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.160]   All right.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.520]   Let's take a, let's see what I'm just looking real quickly to see a samba networking tools
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.680]   are going to be dropped from lion.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.680]   That's interesting.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:18.360]   I mean, what does that mean, siffs or what do they use if they're not using samba, which
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:23.040]   is a emulation of Microsoft's Landware protocol.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.560]   So it's done used for file sharing with Windows machines.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.080]   Does that mean like apple will drop support for Windows networking or we'll do something
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.080]   else?
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.880]   No, you're going to kill me.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   Got me.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   We'll find out.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880]   That was, that was the list.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.680]   But I mean, does anyone really interested in that?
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.080]   Yeah, I use it all the time.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.320]   I was like, I saw that report and I was like, okay, who cares?
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   I can't.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   Well, one of the people networking with Windows, yeah, doesn't work.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   It was money.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.920]   It was a GPL issue, right?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.440]   It was they changed the license.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.920]   So figure out something in a commercial partner.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.240]   You have to network with Windows.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.760]   You can't not network with Windows if you want to sell.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:09.080]   I'm much more interested in like iOS and, you know, AirPlay, AirPrint.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.800]   Well, I know one last story.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.640]   The iPad 2 went on sale worldwide this week.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.160]   Do we have any reports about availability?
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.800]   I know that they're going to add radio shack locations today.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.440]   500 radio shack stores will start selling the iPad 2.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.800]   I guess the shortages are a thing of the past or soon to be.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   I doubt it.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.800]   I think, you know, they've got a couple of weeks before they catch it.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.840]   But look at this, you know, last year when they launched the iPad, it was only available
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.840]   at the Apple Store.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.840]   Right.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.560]   Now they've got like dozens of locations all over the world.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.040]   So they've got a much, much bigger distribution network.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.800]   And they'll sell millions and millions and millions and millions.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.320]   And millions and millions, yeah.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.800]   Our picks of the week are coming up in just a bit.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.520]   But first I want to remind you about freshbooks.com.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.960]   If you're a freelancer or consultant, if you send invoices, you know the pain of printing
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.320]   and sending invoices.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.880]   That was such a pain for me that I often would just forget about it for eight or nine months
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.840]   and try getting money out of a customer eight or nine months after you did the work.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.120]   That's going to happen.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.520]   That's why I was so happy in 2004 when Amber MacArthur told me about freshbooks.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.320]   And I use them for years.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.880]   It's easy online invoicing.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.280]   It couldn't be simpler.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   You go to freshbooks.com.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.440]   You can find out all about it.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.440]   It's online.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.400]   So that's nice, although they will for a fee print stamp and mail your invoices.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.320]   There are still some old fogies who demand a paper invoice.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.440]   So they will do that for you.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440]   But here's the deal.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.160]   I think this is really great.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:49.080]   That invoice that comes via email has a button on it that says, "Pay me now."
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.560]   And they can use a credit card.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.200]   They can use online payment services.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.960]   They can use PayPal, authorized, there's 11 online payment services.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.440]   They can even set up auto payments.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.640]   Now, that means you get paid faster.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:08.320]   A recent survey of freshbooks users found an average of two weeks faster than their old
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.640]   invoicing system.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.160]   There's also an iPhone app that makes it easy to track hours.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   You can use the web app to do that too.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.600]   And those hours are automatically put right into your billing.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.880]   It does estimates.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   You could include expenses on this.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.000]   You look professional because it's got your logo on it.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.640]   I'm telling you, this is the way to invoice.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.320]   If you've been doing it by hand, if you've been using a spreadsheet or word processor
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.360]   to create your own invoices, please do me a favor.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.720]   Try this free for the first three clients.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.040]   For many of us, that's plenty.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.360]   Just go to freshbooks.com, click the try it free button.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.080]   If they do ask, I don't know if they ask, but at some point they may say, "Where did
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.560]   you hear about us?"
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.840]   You just tell them Mac break weekly.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.600]   You can also call toll free 866-303-6061.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.040]   Freshbooks.com invoicing.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.280]   You will love.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.200]   You will love this.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.440]   You love getting paid.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:04.600]   I use a couple of freelancers that work for me.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.520]   I use it to pay them.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.400]   It's easier, isn't it?
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.400]   It's great.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.400]   It works really well.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.920]   I think somebody now who pays more invoices than he'd since, I think that the payer wants
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.840]   it too because it makes it so easy to push a button and you just pay it and you don't
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.360]   want to get it over with.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.440]   The easier they can make it for you to just pay it, the better.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.440]   This is a two-click, two-click.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.760]   You don't want to have to cut a check, put it in the mail.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.920]   You don't want to do all that.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.120]   I think easy pay is the key.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.120]   Let's get our picks of the week.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.880]   I don't know if we set you up a land or a head of time.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.280]   Did you know that you would have to do this?
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:42.560]   Do you have some software hardware or other that you would like to select as a pick of
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.120]   the week this week or you can recuse yourself?
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.960]   I just started using, actually two things.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.360]   There's two of us that just started using this week and I haven't really used them that
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.960]   much so then maybe problems that I haven't yet discovered.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.920]   Mapquest, remember Mapquest?
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.400]   They have a free app that does turn-by-turn directions.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   Really?
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:09.440]   It's the only free mapping app that does turn-by-turn directions.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.320]   I was so flabbergasted, I was like, "Mapcasts, Mapcasts, still around."
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.320]   They're still around.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.320]   I'll be done.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.800]   This is a really good app.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.840]   I've used it for a couple of things and it even does recalculating if you take the wrong
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.840]   turn.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.440]   So it will talk to you?
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.760]   Yeah, yeah, and it works pretty well.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.360]   I was really surprised.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.840]   All right, that's one.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.480]   You said you had two?
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:39.400]   Well, the other one is a cycling app that I haven't actually used yet but I just downloaded
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.400]   it.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.160]   The beauty of it, it's a GPS app that tracks a bike ride.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   Which one?
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160]   There's a number of them.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.160]   I've used bicycle and map my ride.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.880]   This one's Strava, link to Strava.com.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.880]   Strava.com.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:25:02.560]   Strava.com is a website for training and for tracking bike rides, doing routes.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.840]   And it's especially good for seeing how quickly you ride compared to other people on the same
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   route.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   I like that.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   I like the competition.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.960]   And so this is actually really clever.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.040]   It was just like, the Strava app only has three screens.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.880]   The first screen you see right here which tells you the time, distance, speed.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:29.040]   And then one of the other screens is how well you rode a particular section compared to
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.040]   other people.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.440]   And this is usually geared to climbs.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:38.200]   So if this one particular hill, you can see where you come on the leaderboard compared
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200]   to others.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.200]   And it's super cool.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.880]   It's like a pinball high score system.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.800]   You can be king of the mountain or queen.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   Right, exactly.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.800]   I love that.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.280]   So I haven't actually tried this yet.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.760]   And the speed I ride, there's no way I'm going to get anywhere near the leaderboard at all.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:59.960]   But I think it's a clever way of making, putting some competition into a fairly solitary
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   act.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   Sometimes it's solitary activity.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.280]   Well, if you just go up a hill, nobody else goes upwards.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.280]   Really not a steep hill.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.400]   Maybe you could be the king of a hump.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400]   Maybe a downhill.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.840]   No, back in college, I was considered the king of the hump.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   That was many years ago.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.320]   Thank you, we had to.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.720]   Clinton was an office, you know, it was a different time.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.480]   Yeah, times are different then.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.880]   Annie and I go, you're picking the week.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.720]   My pick of the week is a iPad mounting bracket.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.800]   I'm proud to show off my kitchen.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.120]   The only kitchen home improvement project that has ever really paid off well for me.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.680]   This is my kitchen, one of my kitchen cupboards.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.800]   And now you open the kitchen cupboard.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   Hey, look, there's an iPad there.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:51.360]   So I've seen a lot of different iPad mounting brackets over the past year.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.920]   This is really cool one called the pad bracket that if you go to padbracket.com, what I love
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.960]   about it is that I'll zoom in so you can see the thing a little bit better.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.720]   It really is next to nothing.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.960]   It's just a little clip that you hold on with two screws.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.240]   I'm certainly not the sort of financial league where I can afford to permanently mount an
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:17.840]   iPad anywhere and leave it there just as a permanent piece of decoration.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.000]   The use for this is always going to be I want to just simply have a place.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   I like this.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.400]   I have some place handy so that when I'm at my desk, I can put my iPad there and use it.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.240]   When I'm in the kitchen, there's so many.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240]   It's not attached to the wall.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.600]   You just it's like a little stand.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.600]   So you can just pick it up.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.600]   It is it is a bracket.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.600]   Right.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.040]   So it is a bracket that mounts with two screws.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.480]   But the idea is that it's easy to put these wherever you need them to go.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.520]   And when you when you don't have the iPad in there, it's not like you have this big ugly
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.440]   frame just bolted to the wall.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.160]   I'm going to mount this to my forehead.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160]   Or maybe my wife's forehead.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.080]   She says I've always looked at the iPad when I should be talking to her.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.000]   Actually actually maybe you can get one of those like Bob Dylan's style harmonica stance
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.080]   and put this pad bracket on it.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.080]   The harmonica.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.720]   Have a picture of your face only only your smiling and cheerful and approachable.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.080]   So if you're having a bad day, you can just be behind the iPad.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.080]   I am happy now.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.840]   I'm so glad to see you.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.880]   This is a very, very good idea.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.880]   As I said, it's simple.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   It's direct.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.160]   It doesn't it doesn't make more of itself than it does.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.160]   The only the only thing is that obviously if you're looking for something that will if
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.880]   you if you bump against your iPad or if you there's an earthquake or if you in this door
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.560]   thing, if you if you you can knock the iPad out of the bracket, if you have a desire to
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.200]   knock the iPad out of the bracket or if you're really, really careful with careless, it's
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.920]   not designed to be a permanent bracket of any kind, but it makes it really, really easy,
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.000]   especially for like a kitchen application like this, where you know, when the when the
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.680]   door is open, I can see my recipe.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:58.560]   I can see the Walton Brown walking me through how to make a make a dieogenesian apple crumb
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.000]   cake exactly the way that the chemical the chemical gastronymus said you're supposed
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   to do it.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.560]   But when I don't need it, the door is closed and I don't have this I don't have this bracket
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.160]   or this anything else messing up the rest of my house.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.640]   So really like it a lot.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.800]   It's 29, 99, but I think it's worth it.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:19.120]   I'm I as soon as I realized that that was exactly where I needed to go, I'm really glad
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120]   that I installed this.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:25.720]   I've been I've been really stupidly over ambitious with my meals for the past four days ever
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.040]   since ever since having this bad bracket in there.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.080]   So I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'm glad I just live in the
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.480]   kitchen now with my pad bracket.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.160]   I love my pad bracket.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160]   You know what?
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.840]   I think that tonight will have rice and beans.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.760]   I need a pad bracket in the kitchen.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.640]   You know, I think you are you might have already picked this Andy, but just in case you didn't
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:57.000]   I have to say I this is the we talked about this before the the HTMI adapter $40 at the
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.760]   Apple store for the iPad.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.240]   And I'm thrilled with how well it works, especially if you're putting this on a big screen TV
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.400]   or any, you know, a nice quality screen.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.320]   The iPad looks great and a great way to play games and so forth.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.440]   It has a USB connector too.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.440]   So you could plug this into the wall and keep the iPad charged.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.840]   Have you found another use for that USB connector?
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.680]   Zek give you USB access.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.080]   Another another doc connector.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:24.840]   No, as a matter of fact, I tried to find out if when I when I had the I tried to find
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:31.200]   out if I could give a garage band demonstration and have both the USB camera adapter plugged
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.840]   in and unfortunately did not work.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.600]   I think I think it's the only things I've been able to get it get this this second doc
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:43.840]   adapter to work with is my cables wrapped around something.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:46.720]   That's that's why I was the kick of the humpback college.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.200]   Hey, hey, I go I go like the only thing I can get that the second doc adapter to work
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.040]   with is charge and sync.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040]   Okay.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040]   I don't know if there I don't know if you can do anything else with it.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.440]   I couldn't I couldn't get a microphone.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.440]   That makes sense.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440]   That's what it's designed to do.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.680]   But yeah, it is and and should be mentioned that if you have the iPad it will only do
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:08.160]   the mirroring if you have the iPad to it will work with HD as an HDMI second screen if you
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.520]   have an iPad one.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.560]   If you have an iPad to the old fashioned VGA adapter will also do live mirroring through
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.560]   VGA.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:20.880]   But I the killer app for this is just you have a big 42 inch 50 inch 60 inch TV in your
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:26.640]   housing and the ability to have whatever happens on this happens on that just makes this so
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.160]   much more valuable to you.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.800]   And I should mention in the Apple store, they bill this is also working with the iPhone
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.680]   and the iPod touch as well as the iPad one and two.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.280]   But as you say, it will have to be an app that's enabled for setting video out.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.440]   So but but I mean for a lot of apps work the way for instance, the squirrel video that
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.760]   you have been playing all day is actually the coming directly from the Dropbox app.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   And there you go.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.760]   It does nothing.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:56.480]   It does nothing more than simply understand that see that there's a second video monitor
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.280]   attached and simply send the video through there.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.240]   So so lots of existing apps are these.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.320]   And if you if so does I the iTunes thing.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.760]   So if you've got a video on your on your iTunes and you've got this connected, you could also
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:11.800]   I presume send the video out to the to the TV set.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.360]   It is nice on the iPad to because you get 1080p video, which is pretty cool.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.800]   So that's I think it was a $39 at the Apple store.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.360]   And I think that's pretty neat.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.360]   Pretty nifty.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   Pretty cool.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.400]   Lots of people been asking me since I've been showing the iPad to I changed my wallpaper
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.880]   to this great live.twit.tv wallpaper and people have been asking me where they can get that.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.040]   It's on our Twit wiki was designed by Rob G of failed skateboards.com.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.120]   That's a great skateboard designer.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.520]   And he did it just kind of a cool kind of punk design with some splattered paint.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:48.240]   We made a t-shirt out of these actually that we gave away at South by Southwest.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.360]   Those are collectors items because they were printed backwards.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:55.080]   So instead of Twitter, it's toot, but that's okay.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.600]   That's okay.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.960]   But if you do want this, it is free.
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.800]   In fact, we have a version for the iPad, the iPhone and desktops as well.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:10.040]   If you go to wiki, wikki.twit.tv and then cert, the easiest thing is a kind of longer
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.040]   URL.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:17.920]   But if you search on wiki.twit.tv for desktops, that's the page, d-e-s-k-t-o-p-s.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.600]   And there's some other Twit desktops there as well.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.600]   But this is a great one.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.840]   Rob G did such a nice job.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.480]   So that's not exactly a pick.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.480]   That's a freebie.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:30.120]   But a lot of people have been asking me where to get that great live.twit.tv desktop I use
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120]   on the iPad.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.120]   That's where I got it.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.120]   I guess then you will email it to yourself or something.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.520]   I can't remember how I did it.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.840]   Hey, it's so good to have you.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.080]   Leander Connie is from the Cult of Mac.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.720]   CultofMac.com.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.320]   A great website for people who want to know about Macintosh.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.040]   I think you want to plug Leander as long as we got you here.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.040]   Oh, what website?
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.040]   Yeah, or anything.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.040]   You want to plug your Hillride?
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.040]   Anything.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:01.440]   I was going to talk about actually I discovered a really cool hack for the camera connect kit.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.440]   You know what?
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.800]   I didn't mention your article on that.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:04.960]   Tell us about that.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.920]   I haven't written this one up yet.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.920]   I just discovered this.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:12.600]   But you can use any flashcard as a storage device for the iPad.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:17.000]   By plugging it into the camera connector.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.760]   The trick there is to you have to rename whatever you load onto it to disguise it to
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.160]   pretend it's like a picture that was taken by a camera.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:32.360]   So, in other words, you put it in the, if it's a memory card, there's a DCIM folder
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.120]   that most cameras use to store pictures.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:42.360]   And if you can load on a bunch of videos in there and just rename them to be, you know,
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.360]   I'm sorry, it has to be eight characters.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.040]   So, you know, zero, zero, zero, one, four, three, go JPEG.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:54.080]   Then you can import that into the iPad.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.440]   And it'll play, you know, if it's a movie, if it's a full-length movie, it'll play inside
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.440]   quiptime.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.440]   Wow.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440]   So, you're not supposed to do this.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.120]   You know, this is not, this is kind of a little bit of a hack.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:12.880]   And you can, it'll, so you can buy a 16 gigabyte iPad and, you know, then get a couple of
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:17.360]   bunch of big memory cards and it'll, you know, infinitely expand the memory of the iPad.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360]   That's really interesting.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.920]   So, it's always moved as a music and other, you know, sort of any kind of file that will
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.560]   play PDFs where documents would be like.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:30.240]   Actually, that gets us kind of like that Dropbox hack that you're doing Andy, except
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.800]   that you can take it right off the flash instead of off a Dropbox.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.400]   Off the, off the try that.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.600]   I know, I know the camera connection kit works through the pictures and the movies apps so
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.600]   that rather rather, through the picture role, if it's a iPad compatible video file, just
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.440]   import as though it was a video camera that was importing a piece of video.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:52.240]   I didn't know that you could put a PDF on that card and we'll open the PDF.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.520]   He's saying it will open the PDF as though it were stored locally.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.400]   Apparently, any file that the iPad will open, you can, you can store on the, on the external
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.800]   card or the thumb drive.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.800]   It's a heck of a, how do you navigate to it?
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:11.440]   You plug it in and it brings up the, the, the photo app, you know, through the photo app.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.600]   And then you just do import and portal or import selected and it'll pull into the.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.720]   So, so it'll import the PDF and, or the word file or whatever into the pictures app?
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.720]   Apparently, yeah.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.240]   You know, I actually don't have only done it with videos and did I do it with the PDF?
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.960]   I might have done it with the PDF too.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.880]   But from what I recall, yeah, they said it worked with, you know, different, different
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.480]   times, any, any kind of file that the iPad can read.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.440]   Well, I hope you will write that up and put it on cultamac.com.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.960]   There's a how to section there.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.640]   Great place to find out about a lot of cool things.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:44.920]   You've got hundreds of tips there.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:49.520]   And of course, news, reviews, apps and deals, cultamac.com.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:53.080]   It's been going well since you spun this off.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.320]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.320]   That's great.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.320]   We're so glad you did that.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.320]   I think that's brilliant.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.320]   Me too.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.600]   I'm all for the, the individual media entrepreneur as you might know.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.600]   Right.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.440]   Well, one day I'll have to open up a studio next to you as a penpal.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.440]   Deal.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.360]   Actually, that's a great idea.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.920]   A lot of people saying they should, I should get off of Mac break weekly since I'm an Apple
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.920]   haters.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.920]   So maybe we'll just have you take it over.
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.440]   You do a good job throwing a critical line.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.480]   Such an Apple hater.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.480]   Hate Apple.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.200]   That's why I bought, I spent some, some of you said, you don't have to give Steve Jobs
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.680]   $200 to appear on Mac break weekly.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.640]   You give him thousands of dollars a month.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.640]   True.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.640]   True.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.920]   Andy Inako is at the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   That's where he and the squirrels appear.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.920]   Www.cwob.com.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:50.080]   I love it that they appear on command apparently.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.080]   Yes.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.720]   You can also read his stuff at the Chicago Sun times and he got my hands.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.720]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.560]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time live.twit.tv.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.560]   Stay tuned.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:14.120]   We have moved net at night to a new time and a new day and a new name.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.560]   It's called the Social Hour now.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.160]   Sarah Lane and Amber MacArthur host that.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.160]   We do that.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.160]   Now Mondays at 11 a.m.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.720]   We're trying to get good strong content Monday through Friday at 11 a.m.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.160]   I think we've finally done it.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.640]   So Monday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time for the social hour.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.320]   The first issue of the social hour is up in the old.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.400]   If you're already subscribed and then at night you'll get it.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.000]   It's in the old net at night feed.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.640]   Twit.tv/natn.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.480]   We should probably alias social hour or something.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.800]   We haven't done that yet though.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.840]   But a great show with two of my favorite people in the world.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.160]   Sarah Lane and Amber MacArthur.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.160]   Let's see.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.160]   What else?
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.160]   Anything else to promote?
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.600]   We're going to be at NAB in a couple of weeks covering the National Association of Broadcasters
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.600]   show.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.680]   Lots for people like you, Leanna.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.280]   Lots of interesting stuff about doing it yourself when it comes to broadcasting.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.880]   And we'll have to show our members in the big helicopters and all the other massive
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.360]   TV equipment they have there.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360]   So like fans.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   Cool show.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.360]   I'm looking for a helicopter.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.320]   You're like the Twitcopter.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.320]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.320]   Break time's over.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.320]   Get back to work.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:18.320]   Bye bye.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:18.680]   Bye bye.
