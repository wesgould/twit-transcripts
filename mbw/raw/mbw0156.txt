[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that answers the question.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.160]   What is the question?
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.600]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.160]   The question is why are we bothering wasting time
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.480]   with such trivial matters when people are suffering
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.520]   in this world today?
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.280]   Well, I won't have it.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.880]   I won't have it.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.360]   That's the question and answers.

[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.360]   good to talk to you, Andy, from the Celestia Waste
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   of Bandwidth, Imperial Headquarters, aboard Death Star 2,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.280]   somewhere in the galaxy of Tatooine.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.560]   >> No, no, I'm here from -- I have a mandate from God.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.880]   This is divine ordinance at work.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.840]   So if we're going to be discussing snow leopard,
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.440]   are you going to disagree with me?
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.960]   >> I am.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.880]   I'm prepared to disagree with Andy and Ico.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560]   But we'll see if we disagree.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.600]   Also here, first timer, Anubi.

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   I should ask you.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.120]   >> I had a 10% hack of fair.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   >> I should have asked ahead of time.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.280]   >> It's got a few diligence.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.360]   >> Yes.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.320]   Oh, I prepared.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680]   I really prepared for this show, let me tell you.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.280]   We asked John Syracuse from Ars Technica to join us.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.040]   He does -- anytime there's a new OS, he does a very --
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.560]   I think a very good job of dissecting it on Ars Technica.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   At press time, we haven't heard back from Mr. Syracuse.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   But it's possible he may join us last minute.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.000]   And also here in studio with me, Mr. Alex Lindsey.

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> Good to be back, I --
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.200]   >> So now, use guys, Andy and Alex, who were under NDA last week,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.400]   and finally speak.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.600]   You've been using Snow Leopard, how long?
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.520]   >> Well, we've had it for a couple of weeks.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   The release version.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   >> The release version.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> Yeah, what was what we assumed was the release version.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.280]   >> And as a developer, you weren't able to talk.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   >> Right.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.600]   >> Long of you had the -- Snow -- because you had to have it for your review,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.560]   by the way, excellent review in the Chicago sometimes.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.880]   You had to have it for that, right?
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   >> Thank you much.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   Yep, I've had it.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.560]   I got it about two weeks before the release, and I had a nicely silk screen to DVD and
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   everything.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.440]   So I didn't trust it enough to put it on the iMac and the really, really, really super
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   important MacBook.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.520]   But I had a brand new MacBook, and I had it on an old MacBook of mine.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.320]   So yeah, that was two weeks of what world am I going to live in today?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   Do world much everything makes sense?
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.480]   Or the world and -- oh, wait, that button does something more easily.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   >> Wait.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.600]   Now, you guys were very positive and have been very positive about Snow Leopard, and
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.040]   so I was very excited.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.120]   And of course, you know, I see an operating system in development for two years, and,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.320]   you know, long-time beta, I mean, like a year's worth of beta testing.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.680]   I'm expecting some pretty big things from Snow Leopard.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.240]   I read all the reviews from David Pogue, says it's, you know, big, big deal, and from
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.000]   Walt Mossberg and everybody.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.160]   And I installed it, and I had to do a double take, because as far as I could tell, nothing
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   had changed.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   >> Well, I --
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   >> Except that a bunch of crap didn't work anymore.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.960]   So I have to say, I was a little perturbed at first.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.440]   Now I know, and I've got a lot of hate mail for this saying this -- I call it Snow Job.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.880]   To me, this is a marketing ploy.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.320]   This is an attempt to beat Microsoft to the punch.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.240]   We've got to have a new version of the operating system a month before Microsoft does Windows
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   7.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.440]   I don't know if you're doing something here, but all of these changes should have been
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.880]   pushed out in a bit by bit over the last two years that they've been developing them.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.120]   The only -- the significant changes -- and we've talked about this -- of OpenCL and Grand
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   Central Dispatch are significant changes, but users aren't going to see any benefit from
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.880]   this until people write software to it.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   So in my opinion, unless you are a small percentage of users, we're going to get real benefit
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   from this.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.760]   There are people who want to use Apple Mail with Exchange Server.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.680]   If you're blind or you use the assistive technologies, major improvements under the hood, they're
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.360]   well worth the $30.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.200]   But the rest of you -- and I'm not talking about price.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.600]   Yeah, the price is right.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.360]   But the rest of you probably should wait until there's a compelling reason to go to Snow
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   Leopard.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   That -- disagree.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360]   Okay, Andy, go ahead.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.560]   There is a compelling to go to Snow Leopard, and that is two-digit number 29.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.760]   You do get -- now, if third-party developers have released two or three of the core features,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   user features of Mac OS X 10.6 in this release -- if they had released this as shareware,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.120]   if they had released an amplifier for the services menu, if they had released --
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.320]   No, I agree with you.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.320]   I'm not talking about price.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.920]   I'm talking about the fact that there's not enough in here to justify the compatibility
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   issues I'm suffering.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   Okay.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   What compatibility issues are you with?
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.920]   But do you have some really unique compatibility issues, maybe that the average user won't
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   have, though, right?
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.320]   We -- I was talking on Twitch, so I will say.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.080]   We are extremely excited about Snow Leopard.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.400]   We are prepping to upgrade all of our computers to Snow Leopard.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.520]   But when asked yesterday, when we were talking on this week of photography, on Twitch, about
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   whether photographers should upgrade, my response was not yet.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   Wait.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   And because --
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   Not about price.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   The price is right.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   I think the price is great.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.480]   You standard -- best of standard operating procedure for any upgrade.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   You never -- no matter how good the upgrade is, you wait a month just to make sure that
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   everything is compatible.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.160]   Now, this is unique in that it breaks a whole bunch of different stuff chiefly because Apple
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.440]   has finally said, "Look, we have been very nice to you over the past 10 years about this
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   whole.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.280]   We're moving away from PowerPC thing."
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.960]   So not only remove your old hardware, but remove drivers that are not based on modern
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.160]   Intel-based frameworks.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.240]   And that's what's biting most of these other applications in the bus.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   So I understand that.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   And to be fair, the thing that I hate listening to is this isn't coming from ULEO.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.000]   But a lot of people are saying, "Oh, well, this is like a Microsoft service pack.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   This isn't really an upgrade.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.640]   Apple should be giving this away for free."
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.840]   It's a very, very solid upgrade, unless you have -- unless you -- there's something in
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.880]   here that you absolutely need right now, wait a month as usual.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.320]   I mean, I don't see any reason to single out this particular update against 10.5, 10.4,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   and 10.3.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.160]   Yeah, you get less.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.360]   Well, but you're also paying like a hundred bucks less, though.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.920]   I think we should take the price out of the equation.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.480]   There's no question that $30 is cheap and it's worth $30.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   I'm not saying it's not worth $30.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.960]   You seem to be having more of a problem with the presentation than the price even.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.040]   Let me ask you this, Leo.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.000]   If Snow Leopard had come to you via your software update icon bouncing and saying 10.6 is here,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.440]   would you even question installing it?
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.280]   No, probably not.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.000]   In fact, that would be a mistake.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.040]   I would probably would say the same thing now.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.400]   I had to roll back a couple of machines.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.760]   My point is that -- look, they were very clear with developers.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.920]   I remember the WWDC slide that said zero new features.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.240]   They were very clear that -- after talking for an hour about the new features with developers,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.120]   I think what I'm speaking for is the average Mac user who sees, "Oh, the new operating
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120]   system is here."
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.840]   In the past, that's meant significant changes and goes out, spends $30.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.640]   It's not the dollars.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.360]   It's the hassle of the upgrade, which is significant no matter what.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   Operating system upgrades, major surgery, goes through all of that, the breakage that
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.880]   they're going to have, and then says, "And what did I get?"
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.360]   I got a control panel.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.440]   I got 512 by 512 icons.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.240]   I saved 7 gigabytes on a 500 gigabyte drive.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   What did I get?
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.760]   That's not what you get.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.440]   With previous updates, if you don't care about backup, you should.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.360]   But if you don't, you wouldn't care about time machine.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.640]   If you don't care about automation, you didn't care about getting automated.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.520]   Faster machines is something that everybody cares about.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.000]   And that's the core new feature of it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.640]   You really see them on a speed -- I see the benchmarks.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.240]   I haven't seen any speed increase.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.960]   You noticed a big speed increase?
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.600]   Absolutely hell yeah.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   I had two examples in my review.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.120]   One of which was an actual incident that may actually say more about how low-powered my
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   personal CPU is, my brain is when I'm just waking up.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.280]   As usual, woke up, dragged my MacBook off the nightstand in to bed, started checking
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.760]   email, and I was working with Mail.app for about 10 minutes before I realized that, "Oh,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.480]   wait a minute, I'm not actually working on the local machine.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.240]   I accidentally left a window open from screen sharing onto the iMac downstairs.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   I've never had that app work so fluidly before."
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.640]   Making up from sleep hugely faster on my MacBook.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.240]   That I will grant you the wake up from sleep is much better.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.520]   Watching certain apps also hugely faster, especially when you're using Mac-based apps
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.600]   that have already been updated to make sure that they take a certain advantage of OpenCL.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.280]   So I may not be seeing some of this because I'm using a solid-state drive.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.240]   It doesn't seem any faster than me.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.160]   Well, I mean, it's CPU performance.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.560]   And you're going to see way, way better performance in a month or two after all these developers
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.200]   start rolling out support for these new features.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.360]   Every app will be sped up to a certain degree, whether it's noticeable or not, depends on
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.040]   whether or not this specific app has been tuned for these two new technologies.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.840]   By the end, it's going to see a huge boost in performance.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   Well, and I think that as we start to see, I think you're going to see the biggest boost
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.280]   in Cocoa Apps, of course, because they are already sitting on the platform that needs
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.840]   to be able to take full advantage of it.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.800]   I think that for me, and this comes from our production pipeline, and people should really
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.640]   check out Macbreak Video this week.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.560]   We're starting on Friday.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.280]   We started posting stuff that we did with Sal, and you really need to see what services
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   are doing.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.840]   There is, to us, if someone said we would give you a feature set that looked like services
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.240]   that was $29, we would pay for it.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.920]   We'd pay for it for every application.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.960]   It is, to us, this is the reason that we're upgrading to Snow Leopard.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.560]   I think you're a bunch of fanboys who are really blind to the fact that this is not
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   a significant upgrade.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   Well, I'm not saying...
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.600]   I think you're disappointed that you can argue against this stuff, Leo.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   From a feature...
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.920]   No, I'm not arguing against...
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   That stuff's all in there.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   Does it add up to...
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   It doesn't have to point out dollars?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   It's $29.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   It's $29.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   I'm not disputing the price.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   As far as I can see, you have to...
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   Andy, let me argue on Leo's behalf for a little bit.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.880]   No, you don't have to, Scott, but go ahead.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   Well, let me argue...
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.400]   Let me also argue on behalf of kind of the ant-mable type user.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.640]   I mean, I would say I'm kind of just starting to be a power user.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.680]   I'm certainly not using Max to the degree that you guys are.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.000]   But my main reason for upgrading Snow Leopard is...
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.400]   Up to Snow Leopard is this fear I have with my Max.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.960]   If I don't upgrade to the latest version, something's going to break, something's going
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.080]   to get through.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080]   It's like it's just...
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:41.920]   It's not a fanboyism, but almost like this belief in the force that Apple made all this
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   to work together.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.160]   If you want me to have this, I should probably have it.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.200]   Because then went down the road when something bad goes around.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.800]   They're like, "Well, the jet upgrade to Snow Leopard, because we fixed that."
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.360]   And that was my main reason.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.040]   So I'm not looking for improvements necessarily.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:02.440]   It was neat to see DocExpose and my finder seems to be opening a lot faster on both my
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   machines.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.120]   But my main reason for upgrading was if 10.6 is out, I should probably have 10.6.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.640]   Yeah, I think that's why everybody...
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   I think that's why everybody does.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   I bought 10 licenses.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.480]   I'm not saying I didn't buy 10 licenses.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.800]   10 licenses for under 100 bucks is not a bad deal.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.400]   And there's a lot of things that I think that we got a lot less from.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.560]   So I think that for instance, QuickTime is a huge step backwards for the most part.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.640]   The one thing that's kind of like one step forward, two steps back, they basically gutted
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   QuickTime.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.600]   So the reason that you can still have QuickTime 7 installed on Snow Leopard, it's still an
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   option, is because the new QuickTime Max took out most of the tools that we use every day
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   in QuickTime.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   You have to say, it reminds a little bit about when they left iMovie HD available for download
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.960]   when they moved to the new iMovie, it was just a sopp to people who were going to say,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   "I need that stuff."
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.600]   I think going forward, you're not going to see...
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.640]   I mean, I don't understand how they're going to do it for Final Cut Studio users.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.920]   Well, and what concerns me is that I feel like looking at where QuickTime Max is going.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.400]   The one thing about QuickTime Max that is actually fantastic is the screen capturing.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   I don't know if you've seen...
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.480]   It used to be able to do...
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.480]   It's now no longer in Pro.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   It's built in Pro.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   It used to be so.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.160]   It used to pay $29 for Pro, and then you would be able to do an audio capture or a video capture.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.600]   Now you can do a screen capture and send it to YouTube.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.080]   That feature by itself is very, very useful.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.400]   The problem is that there's lots of little things that we used to do with tracks and
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.040]   compressions and all kinds of other things that we used to use QuickTime for, which is
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.920]   now a very consumer-based app.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.440]   The problem is that I think that in the problem for the Mac platform that I think is arising
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   is Apple is crippling Flash because it's not supporting it on the iPhone, not supporting
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   it on the...
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   What we think...
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   We don't...
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   Assume it won't.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   They won't support it on the iPad.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.080]   They probably wouldn't support it in Snow Leopard if they could get away with it.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.880]   So they're not supporting Flash, which is the forefront of interactivity, which is the
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.320]   future of the Internet.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.000]   So they're not supporting Flash, but they're also cutting back all the interactive features
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.520]   that we're in QuickTime.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.720]   What I'm actually getting concerned about looking at the new QuickTime Max is that Apple's
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.920]   dominance in certain areas is dumbing down our experience of what is actually slowing
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.760]   the technology of interactive video, slowing the development of the stuff where it could,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.200]   because they're obviously not committed to that.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.800]   If you look at QuickTime Max, they're not committed to interactivity.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.560]   And they're building devices that would be perfect for it.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.360]   And that I think is a frustrating part of Snow Leopard.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.280]   I think that, again, ironically, the consumer that I'm trying to defend is actually going
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.800]   to be happier with QuickTime Max.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   You're right.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.120]   In this case, that's something a consumer will benefit from.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.880]   As a consumer, you'll think that that's the best player you've ever used.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.880]   It's a great consumer base.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.720]   They'll see that as a big improvement.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.200]   As a power user, I still-- and I'm going to keep on coming back to this because it is
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.760]   the combination of what Automator can do-- or not Automator, but services with WebKit,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:58.240]   which is what we're showing on the show, where you can actually open iPhone-based interfaces
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.040]   with a keystroke, allows us to do all kinds of things.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.120]   And I know that for us-- and as I said, it's not for everyone-- but for us as a workflow
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.360]   issue, being able to-- the services are going to change.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.320]   The way we use services are going to change completely our entire pipeline and automating
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   these pieces.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320]   And it's just--
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.400]   I guess my question is, OK, so Time Machine is twice as fast.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.280]   Wouldn't that have been-- how long has that been around for?
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.960]   How long ago did they make Time Machine twice as fast?
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.880]   Wouldn't that have been a nice thing to ship out in a service pack or an update?
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.120]   In fact, wouldn't about half or three quarters of these things been nice to have just pushed
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   out?
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   Instead, I feel like they held onto it.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   They had to make it into a compelling bundle.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   There is something--
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   Let me let Andy because Andy's--
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.840]   I was going to say a surprising number of these things that seem to be simple features
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.640]   were actually ungodly difficult to do.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.360]   I had a briefing a couple of weeks ago when they gave me the DVD and they showed me,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.560]   oh, and now the Breakthrough New feature where when you click to eject a disc or eject a
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.000]   volume, if it's busy, it'll tell you why it's busy.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.400]   Something it should have done years ago, but now they've got it.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   And I made the usual WISES comments saying, oh, well, thank you for not giving us that
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   1988.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:18.440]   And they explained to me that this problem was so deeply rooted inside the Finder that
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.920]   the only way to fix it was going to be to completely rewrite the entire software mechanism
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.400]   for unattaching volumes.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.720]   And I think that a lot of the features that seem like small things and we wonder how come
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.760]   it took us three years to get it, there was something where, you know what, it's going
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.480]   to be ungodly easy to push that out as a .1 update.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.600]   It'll be very, very easy once we totally rewrite the Finder and Coco, which we're planning
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   to do in the next two years.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.320]   So let's just put that on the table for another release.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.200]   That's POGS point, which is this is a brave thing for Apple to do, which is to release something
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:55.480]   that will appear to many, myself included to be a service pack, even though, you know,
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.440]   from a marketing point of view, that's kind of a problem, but willing to sit down and
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.760]   say, but no, we really wanted to make this better in every regard.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.720]   And from a legal point of view, one of the problems that Apple's had is Sarbanes Oxley,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.400]   which is that they, legally, when we see these little 199 upgrades, you know, so on
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.320]   and so forth, it turned out it wasn't zero new features.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   There are new features in there.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   There's new, there's a new quick time.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   There's new pieces.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.520]   And so Apple can't, their position, whether they can or can't, their position, they have
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520]   to sell it.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   They have to sell it.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.280]   And so the thing is that they can't, they can't just add a bunch of new things to the
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.120]   operating system and then push it out for free.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.600]   That crosses what they have decided is a line that they do not want to cross with Sarbanes
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   Oxley.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.760]   So some of this of saying, well, it's $29, that kind of says, well, it's a fair market
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.120]   price for all the new things that are going on.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   It's a very fair price.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   You know, because we could have, I'm not, I'm not quibbling about the price.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.480]   I'm quibbling about the trouble involved and the things that break.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   Maybe you have to go through that.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   Maybe that's just the way it is.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   And what's slowing us down.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.040]   Well, it doesn't it, it doesn't it feel very much motivated by, to me, what always it seems
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.080]   to me motivates Apple even more than marketing.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:07.200]   And that is jobs or whoever is pushing this at Apple, giving us the user experience that
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.880]   they think we should have.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.240]   They want us to have, you know, they have a vision of the, of the, of the interface and
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.480]   the eye on the, on the user interface and experience that we should be having with our
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.080]   computers that, that is attached to their brand.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.280]   And they're going to deliver it to us whether we want it or not.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.480]   I feel like all of the talent, all of the creativity, all of the stuff was, had been
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.560]   moved to the iPhone.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   All the focus was on the iPhone.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.920]   And this is what you get.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.560]   This is an operating system upgrade that you get when, when 90% of the attention, it's,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   I don't think Steve's attention is on this.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.440]   And I don't think the company's attention is on this.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.240]   And I think this is what you get as a result.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.480]   That's not supported by an Apple as early as two years ago was saying that don't expect
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.560]   10 point for them before 10 point five.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.040]   They said, this is going to be the last really big, huge update we do.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.840]   We're not anticipating a huge multi new feature rollout after this.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.240]   And they're already setting us up for 10 point six being we're just want to finally relax.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.840]   We want to empty out every drawer and look at any, every closet for every little feature
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.520]   that we wanted to fine tune over the past three or four years, but never got to, never got
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.040]   to because we had so many big things to do.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.760]   I really don't think that there's any evidence.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.200]   Do you think this is the end then of big OS updates?
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.920]   I mean, what would 10 seven look like?
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   It's not going to be even.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.680]   I don't think it's the end, the end.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.360]   I think that this might be the Apple might take a year off next year.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.200]   Also, this might be the time when and this is absolute and this is these moments you
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.880]   have to identify something as just complete speculation.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.560]   The next major thing we see will be indeed a very major thing, not a new feature added
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.880]   on to 10 point six or 10 point seven, but something that might be as revolutionary to
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.680]   Mac OS 10 as Mac OS 10 was to 9 point two.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.960]   And so one of the things that I started thinking about looking at this is looking at my laptop.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.240]   This is probably the last laptop that I regularly have.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.880]   You know, this is this is kind of like I'm looking at it like you're ready for the tablet
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   already.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.560]   No, no, no, no, no, it's not that I'm ready for the tablet.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.280]   I'm so I'm unhappy with all the laptop options that I'm getting.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.760]   Like I realized that, oh, I can swap the hard drive on this one really easily by popping
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.680]   open the back because it's the last one with a board, you know, with something that I can
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   do.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.280]   If the battery goes bad, I can swap it out.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.040]   It sorts out the features that I have and I realized that they're not going to make any
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.360]   more of these, you know, and, and, and, and I realized that I just don't think that they're
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.920]   focused on, on this direction.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.400]   And I think that what's going to happen is, as we are going to see more and more, one of
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.680]   the questions that I have is whether you end up with a tablet or a phone, probably a tablet
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.200]   that becomes your, your entire environment and you simply slide it into a, you know, a larger
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.320]   thing when you need to.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.680]   You pop it in and it becomes the kind of the routing brain for what we now have as the
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.240]   Mac Pro, which, you know, can take advantage of all the OpenGL and all the expansion slots
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   and everything else.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.680]   But then you pull it back out and it becomes your little, your little world.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   I think that that might be, you know, the OS is that we see being focused on the iPad and
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   the iPhone.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.840]   Maybe the future of Apple's development.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.640]   I, I do agree that, I think the problem was is that, you know, just like Windows 7 is
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.080]   what, what Vista should have been, should have been snow leopard is in many ways what
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.560]   leopard should have been.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.640]   That would make more sense if leopard were more of a failure.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.160]   A leopard is a lot better than Vista.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.200]   A leopard is, it was a success, but it, it shipped with hundreds and hundreds of bugs.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.000]   You know, it, it is the least stable operating system in five years.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Really?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   In opinion.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   From our workflow.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   That's interesting.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It is the least stable.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.680]   But if you look at the premise then it makes, then this does, snow leopard does make a lot
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   of sense.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   It's, you know, the thing is they got it out.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.060]   They got it out when they needed, they got leopard out when they needed to get leopard
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   out.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.000]   And then, and, and I think that there were many people at Apple that knew that what we
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.920]   need to do is not try to add more stuff on the top.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.180]   We need to fix all the things that we were doing because we were racing so fast forward.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.180]   That might make sense.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.180]   No, that would, that would make sense.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180]   I'm like, I might buy that.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.760]   When you look at the level of now, the penetration of 64-bit, when you look at a lot of the, you
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.040]   know, rewrites of all the code, sure, there's not a lot going on on the surface, but I still
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.760]   think this is one of the biggest upgrades code-wise that, that of any, you know, version
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.280]   that we've seen in a very long time, it's just that, it's just that it doesn't affect
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.480]   us as viscerally as some new cool feature.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.080]   And I think that there's enough cool features in it that, that make it worth the, the $29
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.080]   upgrade.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.920]   I think at $129, Apple would have been in a world of hurt.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   I agree.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   I agree.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   The $29, I think, I still think it's a no-brainer.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.360]   I just think it, I just think it's just features that nobody would understand.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.040]   I mean, if you tell an average person, you know, that I'm trying to think of what was
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.640]   a big thing with leopard, you know, I mean, even the, I think even regulators get excited
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.320]   about the new, spacey, nebula wallpaper that comes out there and understand that that's
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   new.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:43.520]   But I think 90% of the people that run a Mac have no idea 32-bit, 64-bit, they don't
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   understand it.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   They don't have to.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.920]   Do you think it's a problem that it starts in 32-bit, Andy, instead of 64-bit?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.880]   I don't think so because it's transparent to the user.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.360]   Users don't know or care.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   Apple, they don't know.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.200]   They don't care about any of these technologies that, that are a piece of things.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   I was surprised.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   And then, and then, and then I'm supposed to.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.280]   As long as it doesn't interfere with how they use their machine.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.560]   And I mean, that, that is a good point, but that's true of just about any feature.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.840]   There's the number of times that, that I've had to sort of show somebody how, how expose
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840]   a works.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.720]   It's like, oh, you mean that don't have to just keep dragging windows around randomly
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.200]   to find out, no, there's actually feature for that.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.040]   But, you know, and there's a way to actually have more than one desktop.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.760]   I'm sure that I'm going to spend a lot of time.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.280]   I'm sure that the first time, like I'm in the middle of like demonstrating something
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.400]   in front of like, in front of a big group on a projector and I need to drag and drop
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.520]   something, I'll just nonchalantly, just without even thinking about it, use doc expose to
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   do it.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   I'll get at least three.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Wait, wait, what did you just do?
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   How did you make that happen?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   It's kind of point.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]   But you could do that.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.200]   I'm telling you could do that with leopard.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.760]   I mean, honestly, there's a lot of features in the way.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.840]   You don't have to have snow leopard to surprise people.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.080]   If you press the six and four key on boot, you'll get in a 64-bit mode.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.240]   And I presume at some point, that will break a whole bunch.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   That's the warning.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.440]   That's the reason it's not starting out in 64-bit is because when they start it up,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.680]   they're giving developers a little bit of time.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.920]   And at some point, they'll flip the switch and it'll start booting.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   Exactly.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.720]   So right now, my computer is booting into 32-bit.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.760]   The OS, the Finder is 64-bit.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   Which was a...
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.440]   Is that part of the speed up?
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.120]   Well, I don't know if it's part of the speed up, but that's part of a lot of code work
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.760]   to get that rewritten completely.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.160]   Yeah, that's a big deal.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.200]   I think the chief speed up is finally being rewritten in Cocoa.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.560]   They throw out everything and totally rebuild it.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   Right.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.240]   Then I think that when we look at what's going to be possible three to six months down
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.600]   the road, I know we're already looking at our pipeline as far as we do very graphics
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.800]   heavy solutions.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.160]   And the OpenCL stuff is going to be a big deal for us as we start developing.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   And I think that as other developers are going to...
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.360]   And that's my other issues, but it's 36 months down the road.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.760]   And so you could say that's in there and you put it in there and tell the developers,
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760]   and that's important.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760]   Well, you have to put it in.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   You have to do it.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   You're not going to develop for it until it's in there.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.640]   I understand there's a chicken and egg.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.920]   But again, end users aren't going to see a benefit.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   Not immediately.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.000]   Well, it's just another reason to say don't upgrade yet.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.600]   There's no compelling reason to.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.320]   Or do you think there are enough bugs in Leopard that it is compelling to the upgrade
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   as a Snow Leopard?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.600]   Here's the thing is that it really depends on the kind of applications you're using it
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   for.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.360]   For us, even, it's going to take us two months to move all the machines to Snow Leopard.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.440]   It's not like we're going to install Snow Leopard on all 20 machines.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.440]   I was ready to do so.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.000]   And I actually said, "No, we'll stop guys.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   We're not going to do that because there's problems."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.120]   Because we have to research, for instance, CS3.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.920]   Adobe has said, "Well, we're not supporting CS3 for Snow Leopard."
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.240]   I had to buy CS4.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.440]   Well, we've been...
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.320]   What that opened up was a whole conversation because we need Snow Leopard more than we
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.320]   need CS3.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.240]   And so, like, we're now...
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   My butt CS4.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.600]   A lot of us are circling around.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.760]   Adobe's probably thanking Apple for this one.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   Maybe.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.800]   But, I mean, the problem is, is that there's a bunch of us...
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.280]   One of the things that came up around...
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.320]   Even though CS4 is 32-bit.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.440]   Well, the conversation that we had internally was that 80% of the stuff we use in Photoshop
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.040]   was in Photoshop 3.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.000]   95% of what we use is incorporated into CS1.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.320]   And we were like, "What we really need is a..."
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.400]   We really want to look at something like a Pixelmator, which isn't quite mature enough
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.560]   yet to use as a production app.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   But it is...
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   You were saying you might use elements.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.960]   Well, we're looking at using elements for the lighter...
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   For the lighter...
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.720]   For our iMacs, for some of the stuff, we're looking at installing elements across that
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.480]   because we just need cut and paste color correction.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.080]   You know, a couple little things that are there doesn't make sense to put Photoshop on
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   it.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   But that...
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   We were Photoshop all the way across and now we're starting to wonder whether that makes
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.680]   sense as we don't know whether CS3 is going to move forward with Snow Leopard.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   And we're not...
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.040]   I mean, I have CS4.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   And it's not...
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   And we have a couple CS4 licenses, but it hasn't been across the board because the guys have
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.800]   been very happy, to be honest, with CS2.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.400]   We haven't upgraded because we have a lot of those licenses and we never moved to the
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   newer ones.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   Did you upgrade, Scott?
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.320]   Because I imagine this is an important tool for you.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.240]   Yeah, no, Photoshop is where I live.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.560]   And I've been upset with Adobe about this anyway because it feels like they've been
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.920]   upgrading Photoshop.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.280]   I mean, the whole suite.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   Just way too often.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.360]   Like it went from CS2, CS3, CS4.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.600]   It's like every six months I'm going to buy something new.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.480]   But I did upgrade to CS4.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480]   And...
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.560]   But I thought CS3 was working.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   Is it just...
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.560]   Is it not working or is it just a...
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   It's not supported.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   It's not supported.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560]   And I've heard...
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   I haven't...
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.400]   I actually hadn't had any problems with it, but I've heard stray reports that there are
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   issues with it.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   So I don't know.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.640]   I'll tell you what I did do.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.280]   Since all my data is kind of in the cloud, I decided to chance it on my work machine and
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   just upgraded Snow Leopard on my production machine.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.280]   I think that's completely appropriate.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.200]   And I mean, I've got...
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   It's pretty custom.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.360]   I mean, I've got a Cinti cooked up to it.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.400]   I've got two monitors and I just put Snow Leopard on.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   And everything works fine.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.880]   I will tell you this.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.080]   It did reset all of my Photoshop settings for some reason.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.920]   Like it turned on all that OpenGL stuff in CS4 again.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:03.720]   And so I'm going to the space bar hand tool that moves your document as your drawing.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.360]   And I go and I move it and it throws it.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.400]   And my comic strip starts to move a little bit and glide.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   And I'm like, "What is happening?
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   What is this?"
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.720]   Yeah, and it's rotating and it's too much.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.240]   I just went and turned it all off.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.680]   But no, everything is running fine.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:26.240]   Yeah, I think a lot of people when Adobe said we're not going to support previous versions,
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.000]   the implication was it would somehow not work.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.120]   And there have been reports that CS3 has worked fine.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.680]   A lot of people go, but we're doing research before we start doing a bunch of things.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.280]   A bunch of purchasing, that's all.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.200]   But Adobe definitely needs people to be updating.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   I mean, that's part of all.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   That's a great excuse.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   They say it's not.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.800]   Of course, that's not it.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.200]   We're just future minded.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.440]   But obviously, from a business perspective, Adobe's been having an increasingly hard
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.840]   time getting people to pay the upgrades, which I think are too expensive.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.480]   I think they are upgrades for Photoshop and $300.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   Was it $300?
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.120]   Yeah, it's too much for incremental upgrade.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.360]   Andy, any other thoughts?
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:14.840]   That Britney Spears can still reinvent herself if she just takes five years out of the business.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   I disagree.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   I disagree.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.440]   What she looked like all the other passion come with a really good smaller like.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   That's just marketing.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   She shouldn't have been upgrading herself for the last few years.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.960]   What's your favorite snow leopard feature now that you can talk?
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:35.000]   It's probably got to be the changes that they've made to the services menu.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.360]   Alex is so excited about that too.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   I mean, I looked at it.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   I just don't know what I would do with it.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   You got to watch the videos that we put up on Macbreak video.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:49.160]   When you combine the services with WebKit and some of the other stuff, it's pretty cool.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.920]   So I should start playing with it all manner.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.480]   Well, actually, it's probably a tie for two.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.280]   But services comes to mind because I'm a big automator guy.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.080]   I love the fact that I've created in about five minutes just a very, very simple automator
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:07.000]   action plugged into the services menu so that anytime I'm in Google Reader and I'm finding,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.240]   wow, he's a really great, really, really long article that I really, really want to get
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   into.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   But I don't really have time.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.280]   I'll just open the web page, select all the text, all like eight pages of it in the printer
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.560]   mode of the web page.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:28.720]   Just bring up the contextual menu on that selected text, go to make this into an audio
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   book.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   And then about five seconds later, congratulations.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.400]   It's been added to iTunes under a special playlist as a spoken audio book.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.200]   And that's just something that it was a feature that I wish that the OS had.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.760]   I could simply add it in a very, very simple and natural way.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   But if you're not an automator junkie like that, then definitely just the doc expose
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.160]   again, so many times.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.120]   But all the time, so I've had it just, it's like trying to find the football after a whistle
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.920]   stop on a play where you just got to keep pulling windows and pulling bodies off before
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.960]   you feel, okay, there's the window that I want to drag something into.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.840]   Now I can just simply drag from here to there.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.680]   Now that I've exposed both targets, the fact that now I can just do that just trivially
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.800]   saves me so much time more than time it saves me aggravation.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.320]   People are going to point out though that you've just fixed something that was really
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.800]   bad to begin with.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   I mean, I think the doc is...
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.720]   I don't think it necessarily was bad to begin with so much as the solution to this problem
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.520]   was not immediately obvious.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.920]   I think there's something to be said for not putting, not trying to solve every problem
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.360]   the user has with the 1.0 of any release.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.320]   I mean, I think this is very much like, you know, of course I've got to make a NASA
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.240]   reference, but this feels like Apollo 17, Mac OS 10.6.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.680]   It feels like they had to spend a long time developing Mac OS 10 and they had to have
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.560]   missions that were actually successful while they were developing this thing.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.640]   And now that they've finally gotten to this very last mission, they know how to build
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.240]   the hardware, they know how to fine tune the operations, they know how to train the people,
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.120]   they know how to get done with all the things they need to get done.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.280]   So now of course we're going to scrap the fleet and move on to the next thing.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   But I think...
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   This is like Apollo 17, you're right.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.480]   No, I wasn't that interested in Apollo 17 either.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   I think it really...
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   I think a lot of...
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   What do you pay $29 for it?
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   Yes, I would.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   That should have been...
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.880]   Hey, I'm not complaining.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   I bought...
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.800]   I guess that I bought 10 licenses.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.440]   I don't feel like I was ripped off.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.480]   That's an amazing deal for 86 bucks to get 10 licenses.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.480]   I guess...
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.480]   I just...
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.080]   To me, when you first boot into it, it's a big huh because like...
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:41.000]   Okay, I just did a lot of work and broke a lot of stuff.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   What did I get?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.440]   Well, also realized by the time you got there, you were already benefited from just the
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.120]   simple fact that the installer is now crash proof.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   I mean, I was doing...
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.080]   I did something a little bit naughty with my third or fourth installation.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.800]   I tried to install it onto a flash drive.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.280]   And it's not something that the installer specifically supports.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.520]   There's a way to trick it into thinking that a flash drive is an installable drive and
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.760]   it crashed like halfway through the install and I thought, "Okay, well, I guess I'm going
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.040]   to have to reformat this."
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.960]   And really by the time that I really noticed that the thing had hung up, the screen went
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.480]   to that pastel blue, the machine restarted itself, no buttons to push, no warnings.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.360]   It simply rebooted off the DVD and picked up the reinstallation exactly where it left
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   off.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   That's cool.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360]   Did you get a bootable drive?
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.760]   I didn't need to get a bootable drive.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.200]   Just like you can do it in 10.5 and previous release.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.960]   Now it's no way for a human being to live.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.400]   But the whole point is...
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.240]   I love that idea.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.680]   It's cool to have a backup boot drive that you can boot off and it has to just be on
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   it.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   That's what I could do.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.960]   Last week's pick, which was that verbatim, tiny, tiny, little, tiny flash.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.640]   I want to put it on the tougher, tiny, yeah.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.320]   Yeah, I thought it wouldn't be great to just have this in your wallet at all times, or
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.080]   you have something you can boot off of.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.800]   Unfortunately, and I was sort of hoping this would be a great test of how slim down the
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   system is.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.760]   I found out that you really can't do a straight install.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.520]   That's anything less than about 8.5 gigabytes.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.080]   There are certainly ways that you can slim down the installation by hand.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   I've gotten it down to five gigs and change even on 10.5.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.440]   But I really wasn't interested in being Rambo at that point.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.640]   If you have a 16 gig flash drive, it'll work just fine.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   What's your favorite?
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.920]   I think I know already what's your favorite, Alex?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   Services.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   Services.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   I think...
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.360]   And I do think that, by the way, services will really appeal to those of you who are
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.480]   using folder actions in the early.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   Folder actions, Quicksilver.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.480]   I mean, like it's...
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.440]   But I'm just saying it's a small...
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.680]   The folder actions have been there for a long time.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.480]   That's very cool.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.000]   It disappoints me that so few people use Automator.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.320]   One of my standards, if you invite me on a cruise around Asia and ask me to put together
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.040]   four or five talks, one of them is going to be, "Here are the applications and features
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.440]   of macOS 10 you are not using."
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.120]   And it's almost like, "Where can I download this Automator?"
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.120]   You already have it.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   You found out the internet.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.680]   No, it's an effort to copy.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   You can do this yourself.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.560]   Well, I think that the power of Automator got a whole new surface when we talk about...
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.560]   When we go to services.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.120]   When you start tying all of this stuff into something that's contextual, that's right
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.120]   there on the top.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.760]   And something that you basically took.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.240]   One thing that no one really knew that much about Automator, number two, services which
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.640]   no one actually used.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.800]   And by a part, they weren't nearly what they are together.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.680]   So I think the services are the big thing for me.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.600]   I do think that when people are looking at upgrading, they should go through a list of
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.120]   all the applications that they use every day.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.520]   Not maybe every app in their apps folder, but most of them.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.360]   And they should make sure that they are compatible with Snow Leopard before they start upgrading.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.240]   I think that is the thing that you need to do before you move forward.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.320]   Scott Kurtz, have you been using Snow Leopard enough to have a favorite new feature?
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   I do.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.080]   Other than finder just being a lot snappier.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.520]   I mean a lot snappier.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.600]   Opening finder, browsing files.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.000]   And I've got a lot of them, big Photoshop files.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.120]   I got to say, I love DocExpose, especially when I'm on my laptop.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.880]   It really feels to me like when I was using old Expose and all those windows would pop
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   up.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   And I'm still confused.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   Like where am I?
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.880]   What am I looking for?
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:21.200]   But to be able to hold down that icon on the dock and have it say, just give me all the
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.040]   windows for this application.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040]   It's so great.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.280]   It works like Windows now.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   It's so nice.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   It's very, very nice.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.440]   Well, finally.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's been in Windows XP for how many years?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Not that he's bitter.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Wow.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   This is bitter.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.280]   This is a selling point for OS 10, Snow Leopard.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   Just like Windows.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   Works like Windows now.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.760]   No, I'm just being facetious.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.760]   But I agree with you.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.400]   That's how it should have been all along.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.480]   It's a big improvement.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.280]   Now you're making me want to reinstall it, but I can't because it doesn't work with a
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.200]   bunch of different drivers and bits and pieces that I use.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.800]   And that's going to sort itself out.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.040]   I mean a lot of it will happen fast.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.680]   I already see a lot of programs.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.080]   It would be with every application.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.800]   We very rarely update the day it comes out.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.600]   I mean with Photoshop usually we wait for three months to six months to upgrade across
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   the country.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   I was never that guy.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.400]   Yeah, because we just we need to actually I don't have that bear bear in our chat
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.360]   or makes a very apt analogy says if your foundation of your house needs to be replaced, what
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.600]   you hope is that it gets replaced and it works exactly as well as before, right?
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.520]   There's no big surprises.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.760]   And that's what he says is happening here.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.480]   It's a new foundation for this.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.840]   This is how this is exactly how I went off my my review for the Sun times.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.280]   I basically said that, you know, previous updates was the update in which we get the
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.640]   whole kitchen remodeled and other update was one which we get the entire bathroom redone.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.720]   We now have a jacuzzi and we now we have a back deck with a jacuzzi and a built in fire
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   pit.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.000]   This is the one in which we upgrade the electrical service.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.640]   We put in a but we replace the roof.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.520]   That's needed to be replaced for the past three or four years.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.880]   We have some guy take a look at the radar and problem.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.360]   These aren't exciting things out of the box.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.440]   But there are things that make the thing a lot better and a lot more livable for the next
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.440]   four five or 10 years.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.920]   They should have just changed the colors or something just to make me happy.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.540]   You know, the new candy cane desktop.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.540]   Clearly.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.540]   Then I would have been happy.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   Just something.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.540]   The ad.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.540]   The ads.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.540]   Give me a switch.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.980]   I just says go back to something for me.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.340]   A gingerbrile edition.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.340]   The Leo edition.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.340]   The Leo edition.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.340]   Right.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.340]   Just something for me.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.100]   Someone can I'm sure can create that.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:48.560]   That's tag with like your personal email address and saying there's something you don't like
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.560]   it.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.720]   Apparently Leo thinks this is exactly what an operating system should be.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   So complain to him.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   No, thank you.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   That's enough.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   They put your name in the OS.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.100]   I thought that was very nice of them.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.100]   I thought it was generous.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.580]   Twice now they've done that hidden.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.700]   There is a text expander feature which unfortunately won't work until people start supporting it
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   in their applications.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.540]   And of course that broke text expander, but the I think the expander has done an update.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.020]   So I rely on there's an example something I rely on.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   They update mail every time they update mail.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.740]   It breaks my my new mail.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:25.480]   So I finally broke down and bought a certificate because that's my MOS works.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.960]   So things little things like that.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.840]   We have a new audio board driver doesn't work with snow leopard.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   All it works with leopard.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   That's why I had to roll back this machine.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.280]   That's a deal breaker.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.320]   Well, it was a big one for me because I rely on that.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.000]   There's a few things like that.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.720]   Not big that we mentioned it before, but snowleopard.wicky.com has a list of compatibility
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.880]   and incompatibility issues.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.660]   There are usually is older mostly older software that it doesn't seem to work with stuff like
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:58.940]   fourth dimension, access grid tool kit.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.940]   I might finally have to get rid of red ride or as my email application.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.380]   Most of this stuff works pretty well.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:13.900]   So I wish that Apple's own Apple has an official list over at support.apple.com and it's extremely
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.900]   thin.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.020]   I really wish that they had been as ambitious as the list you find on that site.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.180]   What you're not necessarily looking to find the five or ten deal breaker apps that will
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.180]   not work.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.220]   What you're hoping to find is to see the most important application in my daily workflow
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.220]   is Scrivener.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.460]   Yes, that's proven to work just fine with snow leopard.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.460]   Great.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.980]   Surprisingly, Bento had problems.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.340]   That was a big surprise.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.460]   Apple told me that I asked them is there is there anything that would typically cause a
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.020]   program to fail under 10.6.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.780]   And chiefly what they're saying is legacy code left over from PowerPC.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.380]   And if you're using APIs and frameworks that just we've been telling you not to use for
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.020]   the past ever since we switched over to Xcode, then that's going to cause a problem.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.660]   They can't be all inclusive, but I suspect that there's a framework in there that they've
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.100]   known and loves this 1995 that's finally biting him in the butt.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.340]   Yeah, I would agree with you.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.500]   That happens almost every time there's a major OS.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.060]   And Apple has been telling people on a fairly regular basis to stop using.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.540]   Well, this is where you're going to have to move or we're going to eventually cut you
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.900]   out a good, a good friend of mine who makes a major piece of software.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.460]   It almost sounded as though he was being visited by an enforcer for the Gambino family.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.420]   Someone who came by and simply said very, very sweetly saying, yeah, you're not using
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.420]   Xcode.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.420]   Are you?
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.340]   Well, I can't tell you why all I'm saying is that it would be very much in your best
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.340]   interest.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.020]   If you would have to write, let's say before.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.900]   Look, this guy's just back.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.420]   I'm going to be made an example.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.540]   You know, it's nothing personal.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.540]   It's just business.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.540]   Just business.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.540]   Bit of this.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.540]   Bit of this.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.540]   I like this one.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:56.460]   Microsoft had a competition on its campus.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.180]   And yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:06.580]   They wanted to, they allowed, it was called startup weekend and young developers came
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.580]   in and they made a mistake.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.140]   They allowed them to develop for any platform they wanted.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.300]   They gave them freedom to go out the wrong way.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.220]   They gave them freedom.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:21.340]   And the winner of best app at startup application 14 out of the 15 companies there had the
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.980]   good sense to write for Microsoft platform.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:29.060]   The 15th company wrote an iPhone app called learn the name it won.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.340]   And it was at 14 hours to build and test the app.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.340]   It's a cool idea.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.380]   The test that you put pulls up your contact list, pulls up a picture, gives you four names,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.380]   you pick which picture you want.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:47.380]   It actually runs on the pre as well as the iPhone, but not on, you know, sorry, doesn't
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.380]   wonder when does mobile.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.380]   Oops.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.380]   I guess it was a little too hard for them.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:55.100]   Well, wouldn't it have been more embarrassing for Microsoft if it was revealed later that
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:43:00.700]   they had they sponsored some software contest and forbade like Apple apps or phone apps.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.700]   They couldn't do that.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   They couldn't do that, could they?
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:08.700]   They can do anything they want.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   Was it Mrs. Gates had said she's not allowed to have iPhones in her house?
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:14.700]   That's right.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.620]   Mrs. Gates, Melinda was not allowed to have anything Apple.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.620]   That's got to hurt.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:24.180]   That's very funny video, which is what yeah, what if that's part of the prenup.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.460]   You may not use anything.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.660]   What about CFS?
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.780]   I was a little disappointed.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.780]   Apple really had had mentioned at one point that they wanted to support this sun operating
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:39.060]   file system rather, which is a really far superior file system in almost every way to
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.700]   anything that's out there right now.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:46.100]   Kind of more like the WinFS that Microsoft said it was going to put in Longhorn.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.940]   It was, you know, the little stubs of it were in the Windows server, Macintosh server, they're
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.860]   gone and there's absolutely no mention of ZFS in Snow Leopard.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.660]   I guess for whatever reason.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.100]   Some are postulating that it might have to do with a licensing issues.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.100]   They've decided not to.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.100]   I think that's a little disappointing.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.820]   I was really, that'd be a kind of move where I would say I know that's under the hood,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.820]   but that's fantastic.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:17.460]   I mean, it just feels like ZFS is so part of the future and it's so frustrating.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.820]   It won't be if no major operating system uses it.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.660]   It just because it really gives you the opportunity to have that cloud of data, which is what
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.300]   we really need at this point as we keep on moving forward.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.300]   It's just frustrating.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.340]   According to nine to five Mac, son employee and storage guru Robin Harris postulates there
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.660]   were licensing issues that prevented Apple from going full bore with ZFS.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:43.820]   He thinks it's the GPL versus the CDDL license that son wanted to use.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.500]   I did ask the question during that question during my briefing.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.420]   I don't have my notes in front of me, but the impression I got was that they don't see
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.580]   a really compelling reason to make a step that big at this point.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:02.300]   I'm going absolutely from memory, but it seemed as though they feel right now ZFS is more of
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.740]   a religious debate than here's how to deliver features to our users.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.460]   I think that will see ZFS support and really aggressive support once they figure out a
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:15.100]   specific OS feature or a specific service they can provide that would require ZFS that
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:20.020]   ZFS totally facilitates and that they can articulate really, really clearly in the form
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.860]   of user feature until then they don't want to put in, they don't want to do ZFS just to
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.220]   say, hey, look, we support ZFS.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   Well, for those who don't know, there is a good episode of Floss Weekly if you want
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.060]   to know more about ZFS.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:36.740]   Some of the features are no more data corruption is almost eliminated.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.820]   It does snapshotting very much like time machine, but it's built into the file system.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.700]   It's automatic, which is fantastic.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.460]   It's essentially got raid built into it.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:51.140]   Compression, it supports all sorts of useful virtualization things.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.940]   You can have multiple disks, put them in a pool.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.020]   Somebody like you, Alex, would love this kind of thing.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.340]   We have just tons and tons of drives.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.740]   One of the things that being able to have the drives in a pool where you're basically
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.780]   slowly pulling the smallest ones out and putting the largest ones in and not having to figure
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   out how you're going to do it.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.780]   Kind of like somebody we know.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   Who is it?
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.780]   A Drobo!
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.700]   But at a much more robust level level.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   It's at the file system level.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.060]   You're a file system level at across every drive that you put in there and being able
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:26.020]   to just have this huge cloud and to be able to add servers to it would be big.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.980]   That's a big chunk to bite off, though.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:28.980]   It is.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.340]   If I read between the lines of what they told you, Andy, that's what they're really saying
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.940]   is it's a lot of work.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.580]   We didn't have to do it.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:43.220]   This is a big opportunity for companies like Drobo, who can, if they can build something
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.660]   a little bit more robust than what they have now.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.500]   I mean, they have a good robust system at the moment, but it would be much better if
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.500]   they could go across multiple file systems and multiple drive systems and so on and so
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.500]   forth.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   Anyway.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.500]   Put all of your stuff on the infest file system.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   It's not quite the same jingo as it is.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   We'll have to work on that.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   We'll have to work on that.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   Zephyr.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   Zephyr.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.740]   We'll throw it in that through auto-tune and it'll sweeten up just again.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   Back to Britney Spears.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.860]   Well, actually, before we get to the other, well, I don't know, are there any other stories,
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.860]   anything else?
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.900]   Andy, did you get an invite to 9/9?
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.060]   Oh, I know.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.060]   There was another story.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.540]   Oh, yeah, that.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.540]   All right.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   So you got your invitation, Andy, because I didn't.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.180]   I did indeed get my invitation.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.180]   Invitation?
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.980]   I know I won't be at this point.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:36.700]   I probably won't be going because it's, again, another one of those things where I think
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.100]   I know what's going to be announced and I think it's going to cost me 700 bucks to
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.100]   go and see that.
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.540]   And it's like, I have other things, like, for God's sake, look at this house.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.700]   I have no decor in my back wall.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.700]   I can't afford it.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:52.260]   I don't want to afford a picture hanger for my George Perez Avengers 40th anniversary
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.260]   framed lithograph.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.260]   Okay.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.260]   That's how bad the publishing industry has gotten.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   I haven't believed against it.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.420]   See, I was thinking that they had stopped inviting me because I didn't even get invites
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.900]   to the last two events because I wasn't going, but you don't go.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.380]   So maybe, I do occasionally go.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.380]   If I can arrange a little bit of the collection.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.260]   Well, I've gone occasionally too, but I'm just saying I thought, well, if you, if you
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.660]   miss one, then they're going to send you the invitation anymore.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.940]   But that's, that's, they never sent me an invitation.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.300]   I just wrote it on your coattails.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.300]   Not that we're bitter.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.300]   Not that we're bitter.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   Anything.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.620]   So it's officially September 9th.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.620]   Is that right?
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.620]   Yes.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.620]   14th.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.820]   I don't rock and roll, but I like it, which is causing everybody to analyze those words
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.460]   as if that is the tip off to the great secret that's going to be announced as opposed to
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.940]   just a catchy music related phrase that seemed to work fine.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.420]   She's also, I should, I should also notice that she's wearing the silhouetted woman in
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.100]   the invitation is wearing capri pants and some sort of slides for shoes.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.700]   So I don't know what that, what that will tell you about, about next week's announcements.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:57.540]   Well, the one thing that's going along with this, this rumor, of course, is that the,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:03.180]   is that a lot of the iPods are across the board are rumored to be running out.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:08.100]   So like the supply side is when they traditionally do an iPod.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:12.100]   So that's why we're, you know, a lot of people are kind of expecting to see something.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.460]   We don't think that they're going to kind of, we don't think they're going to do the
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.300]   tablet.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.300]   We don't think so.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.300]   We would love it.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.300]   We would love it.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   That'd be a sec.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:27.380]   As a matter of fact, I am seeing a unreleased tablet PC at a private briefing in Boston that
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.380]   very afternoon.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.420]   Not app, probably so ever.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.940]   So, well, I can't, I can't say, you know, I wish I could, but I can't say you are, you
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.980]   know, maybe, I don't know, maybe this whole, like having the event on night on the ninth
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.340]   is to distract people's attention away from she.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.820]   How come an octo isn't there and Mossberg isn't there and Pogue isn't there.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.340]   It's almost as if they're all together in a super secret top secret briefing and an undisclosed
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.340]   location.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.340]   You finally entered the pantheon of Apple.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.340]   Here's a secret.
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:59.140]   If I'm talking about something, chances are I'm making it up and I'm not angry.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.820]   That's there we go.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.820]   There we go.
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   All right.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.020]   I have seen something that I think in some ways is an iPod killer, but I can't talk about
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.380]   it till for a couple of weeks.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.460]   But I think that there is going to be some challenges.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.700]   So it is up to Apple to refresh this in a way that is more than just putting on some buttons
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.700]   on the other side.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.700]   No, no joke.
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.860]   The device I'm going to see on Wednesday is indeed a tablet computer.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.980]   Obviously, it's not an Apple tablet, but a lot of companies are using the heat that Apple
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:28.020]   is generating on that, on the concept of tablet computing to roll out their own offerings
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   and give them new relevance because, hey, if Apple's coming up with the tablet, as we
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:34.140]   all know, they are quote unquote, then certainly that's something that we should definitely
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.100]   take a look at our upcoming tablet offering.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.860]   And as a matter of fact, it's sort of an interesting idea.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:43.720]   One of the reasons why I'm looking forward to this is that it is it possible that it
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:49.940]   doesn't even matter what kind of an operating system a reasonably compact, reasonably affordable
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:54.660]   tablet computer runs because when I think of the things that I want to do with a tablet,
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.860]   I'm thinking it needs to be able to run iTunes.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.540]   Hey, that's either a Mac or a PC.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:02.540]   I want to be able to read book reader applications and there are plenty for Mac and PC.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:08.700]   I absolutely, the defining difference between the tablet and a notebook or an iPhone for
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.540]   me is going to be comic book reading.
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.220]   And I want to have a good comic book reader.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.900]   And once again, pick your operating system and it works just fine.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.300]   So I'm very, very curious to see how well this device will work.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.300]   I'm hoping that I'll be able to take one with me.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.420]   That'll have me one that I can borrow for a couple of weeks.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.060]   I'm really curious to see how important it is that whatever tablet it is, it works like
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.780]   a Macintosh or it even works like an Apple machine.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.780]   Hmm.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.780]   Curious.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.780]   I shut them up.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.420]   Curious to know what this will all be about.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.420]   But I do agree with you.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.580]   I don't think that the OS is going to be very important on something like this.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.740]   Unless we can make it more elegant and more beautiful and more easily.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.740]   Exactly.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.740]   Just like the smartphones.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.660]   Again, we didn't know how the iPhone was going to work.
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.060]   I was very happy with a lot of the smartphones that are already out there.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.100]   Apple, I think Apple's greatest strength is the ability to give us more than we imagined
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:00.100]   that we would want from a device to sort of raise our expectations and then meet them.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.100]   Is there anything that can announce about new I...
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.100]   Oh, sorry.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.100]   No.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.100]   I was going to say is there anything they could announce about new iPods that we'd be excited
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.100]   about?
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.340]   Is there anything our iPods currently aren't doing that we want?
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.140]   The Beatles.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.740]   You can't get the Beatles on your iPod?
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.660]   Well, I think that we may look at...
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:18.660]   We may be seeing the end of moving hard drives.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:21.100]   Are there any iPods left with the moving hard drives?
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.100]   Just the classic connected.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.100]   No, you're right there.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.100]   They're going to go all flash.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.100]   So they're going to...
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.220]   And I think that we may be looking at all of them running on the iPhone OS.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.220]   I think that we're going to...
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.220]   I think it's the end of...
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.220]   So they're all going to be...
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.220]   Basically touches.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.220]   They're all going to be touches.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.220]   I think the touch...
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   I don't know if they get a...
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.780]   You'll still have to have a shuffle.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:37.780]   You'll have to have a shuffle.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.780]   Well, the shuffle.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.780]   We'll have to.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.580]   But I mean, I think that outside of that, I think we're going to go to all touch screen.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.220]   I think the most vulnerable device in the lineup, assuming that we were already decided
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:50.380]   that the classic is toast, I think the shuffle is probably the most vulnerable item in the
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:55.100]   list because the big reason to have an iPod shuffle was because all the content that used
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.500]   to be sold via the iTunes store required Apple DRM.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:04.460]   So if Apple wanted to sell a portable music player that also supported the iTunes store,
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.220]   you needed to have an Apple logo on that.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.740]   Now that's not important anymore.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:13.020]   I think the iPod Nano will always have an important part in the lineup because once again, it's
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.020]   the joggers...
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.220]   It's the joggers iPod.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.420]   It's the workout iPod.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.660]   Some people don't want...
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.300]   They're perfectly happy with their Blackberries.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.180]   They're perfectly happy with their big clunky, palm-sized devices.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.460]   They just want something small to play music.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:28.860]   So I agree with Alex when he's saying that it makes sense for them to streamline their
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:33.180]   designs and make everything work under some flavor.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.180]   It's saying that they're going to run the iPhone operating system as kind of a pregnant
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:41.620]   word, but the idea of having one consistent software library that they develop all this
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.100]   code for, it's interesting to see what might be on...
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.260]   If they do rev the Nano again, which probably they will, what kind of code will be running
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.260]   under the hood?
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.620]   That is the last provision to the Nano.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   That was a very, very, very slick clickwheel interface.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.220]   I mean, if we have the Mac interface and we have the Touch interface, it's interesting
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:04.780]   to think about having a clickwheel OS that runs tiny little compact devices that can
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.780]   sell for 99 bucks.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.740]   I wouldn't be surprised if they have a $99 Nano.
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.380]   So let's get the lineup now.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.180]   By the way, a lot of rumors, camera and the iPod Touch.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.180]   You think so?
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.180]   I think so.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.180]   My end will be an iPod Touch 32.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.180]   Do you think it'll go to 64?
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.180]   I don't know.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.620]   Maybe on a high end one.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.180]   If you're dumping the classics, you're dumping large drives.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:32.180]   I think the question they have is how many people are actually using 160 gigs or whatever
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.180]   it is.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.180]   We don't know what the sales figures are, but Apple presumably knows what the demand
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.180]   is for a hundred gigs.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.180]   My guess is the Nano is the number one selling.
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.180]   That's the right price point.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.180]   That's the right price point.
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.180]   That's the case.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:48.100]   I think one of the big things that kept us out of using the...
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.900]   If there was a camera in the iPod Touch, we would probably make that a standard tool
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.540]   for everyone in the office just because that's the...
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:57.540]   It's the mini tablet.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.540]   Not having the camera.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.540]   It's really the mini tablet.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.540]   Right.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.540]   And a microphone.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.540]   The thing is I don't need a microphone in the camera.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.020]   You add a microphone and a camera to an iPod Touch.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.500]   All those people who don't really need the cellular thing.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.500]   I would be tempted to do that because I don't like talking on the phone.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:16.460]   So Striking Ridge says there'll be a Winheim 64 Beatles 64 gig Touch.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:17.460]   I like it.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.460]   I like it.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:21.260]   You know, of course, 9909 is when the...
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.260]   I'll see.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.020]   It'll be a Sergeant Pepper version where all the buttons will seem to flow and move out
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.020]   of your way as they're on those people.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.020]   It's 9909.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.020]   That's the whole...
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.020]   And that's when Beatles Rock Band comes out.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.020]   That's when these compilations come out.
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.100]   It's obviously the Beatles are involved here.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.580]   Here's the question.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.580]   Is Paul going to show up?
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:44.900]   Paul, Ringo and Steve, who would you rather see and who is more likely to show up?
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.900]   Well, but here's the thing.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.940]   You've got to put this in perspective.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.740]   That would have to be the dream...
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.860]   If Paul and Ringo were there, Steve would have to be there because that has to be for
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:55.860]   him.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.860]   For him, like the full circle.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:59.820]   There's only so much John Meyer love to go around.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.340]   Well, but I mean, yeah, I mean, John Myers, great.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:05.820]   But if you had Paul and Ringo show up to play a little tune with that thing.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.540]   Hey, like yourself, got them for E3.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:13.260]   Well, I got to say, I think that the Beatles appearing or any Beatles related announcements
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:18.660]   next on the night, that's a rumor that I just do not believe at all.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.660]   You don't?
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:24.100]   Well, chiefly because the only big news is, and the Beatles catalog is finally coming
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.140]   to the iTunes store.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.140]   Which is going to happen.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   That's going to happen.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.620]   That's going to happen eventually.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:35.100]   But with EMI really say, you know what, let's really just throw away all the sales that
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.300]   we were going to make of the new remastered CDs.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:42.700]   All those box that let's just forget about selling those because we were what we really
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.380]   want is we want to sell these individual tracks for 89 cents.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.260]   What we really want to do is we want to sell the discounted versions as digital download.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.020]   You're saying so they'll wait a little while.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.220]   I think I don't think they'd even I don't think they'll even announce it.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.220]   I would be surprised.
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.220]   Why do you do this on 9 9 0 9?
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:01.020]   I don't think that I don't think that I think the people who buy the box set are a
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.020]   different group than the people who buy them on iTunes.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:06.300]   I really don't think I think that this is this is how nine inch nails made so much money
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:10.700]   with their little box set is that people who want to touch it and have that that collector
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:11.700]   item.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:15.060]   A lot of people who buy the box set aren't going to even take it out of the plastic.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.820]   And if they do, they're going to touch it with gloves and they're going to you know,
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.340]   it's a different I just think it's a different they're not the people who just want to really
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:25.020]   listen to the all the music if they that most people who buy box sets already own almost
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.940]   everything on the box set.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.380]   I mean, that's that's the people but the people who are that kind of market that you're
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.700]   describing selling for the people who know, oh, well, no, they've been totally remastered
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.140]   all that the crappy compressors that were used in 1986 and they'll tell you the brand
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.780]   name and the software and the person to develop the software and the person who ran the software
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.340]   because they're that kind of music affection affectionate.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.500]   I think those the people who would want to have the CD collection just for the purpose
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:54.940]   of having perfect masters perfect AIFF format with multiple no compression top resolution
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:55.940]   possible.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:00.300]   And I think those people would I think those people would look down on 256 bit AAC.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.300]   You're right.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:06.580]   They're not the same people span doesn't already read all their CDs already.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.780]   My friend, but he does fans are going to buy all these remasters.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.060]   They're not going to buy it on the iPod.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.700]   I think it's a really good that are going to buy it on the I can tell the difference
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:18.420]   between 256 bit AAC and and kids will buy it on the iPod.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.300]   It's such a simple conference from decision where you say how many how many sales are
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.420]   we going to make of digital downloads as Christmas gifts, probably next to none.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:31.660]   How many people are going to be giving away these box sets or these individual CDs as
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.340]   Christmas gifts, many, many, many, many people.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:38.980]   So it comes down to what is the upside of announcing this before the start of the holiday
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:39.980]   season as well.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:44.220]   I think I think part of it is is is having the bulk of the marketing all focused on one
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:48.060]   thing at one time getting everybody excited about Beatles, Beatles, Beatles, Beatles and
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:54.140]   having them be able to get it from every in every point that they can because you're
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.980]   going to spend a lot of money on you're going to get a lot of people thinking about the
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.620]   Beatles and you want to make sure that they get it.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:04.060]   They have those opportunities or they you know, or you might it might be harder to get
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.060]   them interested later.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:09.220]   So who doesn't have to spend a lot of money selling promoting the who by numbers.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.700]   It's part of the world song book at this point.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.500]   Whenever they choose to release these things on CD or on digital, it'll automatically be
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.020]   the biggest one of the biggest rainmakers of this digital catalog ever had or the CD
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.020]   catalog ever had.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:23.780]   I don't think that's really an important I don't think that's that's important marketing
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:24.780]   point.
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:27.900]   But again, I don't as you can tell by my decor, I'm not one of these record industry weasel.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.700]   So knows how that business goes.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.700]   No lines.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:31.700]   No lines of blow on my desk.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.620]   No hookers played on the down the desk behind me.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:40.660]   I think I'm just maybe yeah, maybe I just feel Steve Jobs is more is more statistical
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.580]   than you guys do, but I think he's going to want this whole thing to himself.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.780]   I think he's going to want to come back and is this the one where he comes back and coming
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.780]   back.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.780]   Is this the one where he comes back?
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:50.780]   I think so.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:52.780]   I think see him.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:56.500]   What I think is that I think that like so many of the keynotes that we've heard of in the
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:02.060]   past where they are ready to make changes up to a few days beforehand, I think that they
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.380]   have a game plan for if Steve decides that he wants to be leading this keynote and they
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.140]   have a game plan for Steve decides that no, I'd really want to hang back for I want to
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.140]   gain some more weight.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.900]   I want to really look like I want the first the lead paragraph to be looking looking
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.260]   hail and hardy and betraying nothing of his recent health care Steve Jobs may try and
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.180]   return to the public stage when again a January keynote showing up the new Apple tablet.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.540]   It's possibly saving himself for the big Apple tablet reveal because that then he will own
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.060]   the planet in terms of media that day.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.060]   That's true.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:44.140]   So Andy's predictions are new iPods, no classic, no shuffle or a shuffle.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.540]   I think that if there is if there is no shuffle that means that they've decided to reduce
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.540]   the cost of the nano to within a nine hour and a half.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   I think that's very, very close.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:58.500]   I think if they can do an $89 shuffle, then I don't think that the reason for half a nano
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.180]   is because I'm sorry if they can do an $89 nano, I think the reason for the shuffle starts
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.180]   to go out the window.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.980]   I mean, the the the iPod touch with the iPod touch with the camera and speaker microphone
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.980]   rather.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   I think so.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.300]   It's an interesting game of chicken though, isn't it?
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.860]   Where they're they know that people love the iPhone.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.940]   They know that people love the iPod touch.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.420]   Now they can basically again play chicken saying how many let's fat features to the iPod touch
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:29.740]   one at a time before we find out exactly where this this starts stealing sales away from from
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740]   the iPhone.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:35.540]   It's it's it's almost like a replay of 1982 where Steve said, you know what?
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.620]   That lease is a nice computer.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.420]   We'd like to take this feature and I think we'll take this feature and we'll take this
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   feature as well.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.820]   And then people realize that, wait a minute, why am I bothering with Lisa when I have I
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.540]   can buy the Macintosh instead?
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.140]   So a camera there's there's enough outside evidence to suggest that that's that's pretty
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   solid.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.140]   Interesting.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:56.500]   The idea of including a microphone, I think that is I would be worried if I were if I
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.900]   were the product manager of iPhone, I would be worried that, well, gee, now you're turning
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.380]   this into a phone without a without a 3G chipset.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.500]   Now people can use this as a Skype device would work just great.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.900]   But on but on the plus side, it would open it up to so much new software.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.140]   You could basically make the case that this is not just for listening to music.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.980]   This is also for creating your favorite music.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.860]   Well, not only that, with the microphone when you're talking, there's an enormous number
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:24.420]   of applications that I use on when we're talking about recall, Google.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.980]   There's a whole bunch of applications that I can't even like on this.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.380]   Google by itself would be huge.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.860]   I mean, just when you're looking at Shazam, you know that I need a mic for.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.820]   And so there's a bunch of applications.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.740]   I think that's the reason to have the mic more than anything else.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.740]   But I do think that it's a huge boom for people.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:44.940]   If you do a camera, it's just a little bit hard.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.140]   You just reminded me of one thing though.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:51.140]   It's difficult to predict what the impact of that one feature would have.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.740]   Someone at Apple might make the case.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.740]   Well, congratulations.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.180]   We just handed the iPhone market over to Google for voice.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.220]   Google can now just come up with a web app which they think they can make that will
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:05.940]   access the hardware and basically give the iPod touch its own phone number, give it its
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.940]   own voicemail.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:10.540]   Eric Geller is pointing out with a touch if you buy the Apple.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.740]   Mike, you have a mic.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.740]   True.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.740]   Right.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:15.740]   So they may not have to do that.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   They may not have to.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:21.740]   But like if you if your new iPod touch shoots movies and you want to easily be able to shoot
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.940]   movies, you're going to have to have you got to have the mic.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940]   You got to have the mic.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.940]   That's the whole thing is and I don't.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.940]   It may just be still.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.260]   I think at this point you make a still only application.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.620]   I think that you have to add video to the to the iPod touch.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.220]   Getting back to predictions, you say no Steve Jobs.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.740]   He's going to fatten up.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:39.940]   You say and get you saying I think I think that I think that I believe that that decision
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:40.940]   has not been made yet.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.700]   I believe the final decision is going to be made by Steve and he's not going to make
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:49.260]   it until three or four days before I would guess no because I don't think that I think
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.340]   it's going to be it's going to be tablet.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.780]   No Beatles and no Beatles.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.940]   I'm pretty sure no Beatles.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.940]   I'll be really so yoke.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940]   Will yoke be there?
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:02.940]   If you if you was there, then you know Steve will not be there.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:08.860]   I mean it is interesting that it's nine nine nine but it's also Wednesday and their press
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:12.740]   releases if they don't have a keynote to give it's often Wednesday isn't it?
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.940]   Yeah or Tuesday or Wednesday.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.980]   I want to screw with us.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.980]   What do you think Scott?
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.980]   Agree with those?
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.020]   Any other predictions for nine nine nine?
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.380]   Well I'm not like you guys.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   I'm not big times.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.180]   I'm not getting invites or getting.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:29.860]   Hey we're not getting invites either because Andy's early on no longer on Apple's list.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.260]   You can't tell us from all right.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.260]   We're not as important as Andy is.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:38.340]   If I go to Comic-Con will I be invited to with the sign women's hinders?
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.340]   Yes or no?
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.340]   There you go.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.340]   Are you going to Dragon?
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.860]   Are you going to Dragon-Con Scott?
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.020]   I'm not going to Dragon-Con.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.420]   I'm going to PAX instead the Penny Arcade Expo.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.500]   Oh well you got to go to that.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]   I'll be there.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.300]   I'll be there on Thursday actually.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:05:01.980]   I think that I feel like the tablets much further off than everybody's hoping.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.980]   So I think we're much farther off from Steve saving himself for a tablet.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:09.060]   I really think Steve will be back with this one.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.420]   I think that I have a friend who hates iPhones.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.340]   He's a blackberry user and his house is full of touches.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.700]   I mean they run his Sonos.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.460]   He has it's his main internet surfing and email checking in every room.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.060]   So I think they'll really beef up the iPod touch.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.780]   And I hate I hope they get rid of the shuffle because I hate the current shuffle.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:33.940]   It feels to me like they're going to introduce kind of a touch nano I don't know is the is
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   where I think they would go next and then the existing click wheel nano would maybe shrink
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.220]   and become the new shuffle.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.220]   I don't know.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:46.020]   I'm pulling that out of my butt.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.540]   Alex Lindsey your predictions.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.780]   I think we're going all touch screen.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.140]   I don't think they're I think that there may be a shuffle at the bottom.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.660]   I think then I think there won't be any roller wheels after next Wednesday.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:59.940]   I think that there'll be a video at least one of the touches will have or at least one
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:05.460]   version of the touch will have video and audio capabilities.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:11.820]   And and if Steve shows up I will expect if I see Steve there I will expect one more thing
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:15.300]   and I will expect a very big touch.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.940]   If Steve's there.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:22.380]   So I'm assuming that if he's not there that we will see just a bunch of good iPhones.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380]   I I Pods.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.260]   I'm a bunch of well any any iPhone news any you think any Apple TV or iPhone news.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.180]   No, also well I forget about it.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.180]   We're getting about it.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.860]   iTunes app which will probably get a pretty serious upgrade.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.860]   I'm I'm I think will I think one of the biggest announcements will just be that hey look we've
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.460]   reinvented iTunes a bit.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.900]   I think that we're going to have social media features or at least the ability to do more
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:50.580]   with links to iTunes content than simply drag them into a playlist or drag them off drag
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:55.780]   them off the the iTunes window and onto the desktop wreck and then you parse it as a URL.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.100]   I think I think we're going to see an iTunes that's more aware of how people share music
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.380]   and how people recommend music these days.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.180]   Wow, that'd be great.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.980]   Yeah, social iTunes.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.380]   All right, one thing that one thing that has been covered though that they just want to
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.380]   touch on.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.460]   I don't think that Apple will get rid of the net that will move to a whole touch based
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.820]   line only because there's another big feature that the nano has which is that you can't
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.580]   run software on it and you can't download like photos and other stuff on it and a lot
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.100]   of times parents who buy players for their kids they won't they don't want them to access
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100]   the Internet on this device.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.140]   They don't want that to be able to receive photos and text messages on it.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.380]   They want to say they're happy with them being able to watch their videos and play music
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.660]   but that's it.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660]   That's true.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.660]   That's a very good point.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.780]   I would be in that group.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.300]   Mike, my yeah, your kid has an iPhone.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.020]   I know he's three years old with an iPhone.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.220]   All the kids have all the kids have iPhones.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.220]   Alex is not in that group.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:57.140]   Your kids are using Microsoft Exchange server to figure out, well let's be by the same.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.140]   Oh, no.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.140]   Let's go by the juggle of the gym.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.540]   Well, it's just that the thing is is the level of being able to interact with my kids.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.980]   My kids live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:13.380]   I have the ability to get text messages from my son that say that it would also have to
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.860]   be a pulse to increase the wattage laser induced plasma channels depend on photons colliding
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.260]   with O2 and ionizing it would be higher photon density.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.820]   This kid is 12.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.940]   And where were we ever that young?
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.940]   Remember that?
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:31.300]   So, but the thing is that watching my kids use an iPhone, I would never not have them
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.660]   have an iPhone because when you look at whether my daughter or whether my son is, you know,
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.860]   how they capture images, like they remember, you know, they're constantly taking pictures.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.820]   They're going to have an advantage, I think, as they get older over kids who are, you know,
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.900]   hobbled with a shot for it.
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:48.260]   They're constantly text messaging back and forth with each other.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.660]   They're constantly taking photos and putting them on their Facebook.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.020]   They're constantly doing all these things.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.020]   And I think that that's great.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.420]   I think it's great for them to be in.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   I think that's the future.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:01.180]   And I would never, you know, and the reason I didn't get them a touch, I would have gotten
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.180]   them touches.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.900]   It would have been much better for me to get them a touch was because it didn't have
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.260]   camera and audio.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.100]   So if they with that, that I think that's going to be a big thing for parents, actually.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.100]   All right.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.100]   I think you're all wrong.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.300]   My prediction in line with a new boring apple, they're going to say we've just rewritten
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.780]   the underlying operating system.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.700]   You should be happy with what you've got shut up and go home.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700]   Wow.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.780]   We'll have the Beatles iPod when we're good and ready.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.980]   And now you need to start that with the next time we do this to these predictions.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.020]   You have to go question question.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   Oh, you're all wrong.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.980]   You're all wrong.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.860]   New OS for the iPod.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.700]   No surface changes.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.700]   Thank you very much.
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.860]   The new 64 bit iPods.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:44.180]   Now it's time to get our suggestions or selections are picks of the week.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.300]   Now Scott, I didn't warn you that we do this, but if you, yeah, I think you've listened
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.660]   to Mac break weekly once or twice.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.540]   So if you have a pick of the week, you can prepare it now.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.940]   I won't put you on the spot quite yet because first, as always, before we get to the picks
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.780]   of the week, he's thinking, I like that.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.340]   That's Scott channeling.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:03.140]   He's doing the Vulcan mind milled before we do that.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.660]   I do want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.180]   They sponsor this show and give us a great selection of audio books.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:16.100]   You never had a loss for audio entertainment, for education, whatever you're looking for.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.100]   Audible is the place to go.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.460]   It's your bookstore of the internet.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.100]   Download a book within a minute or two.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:27.740]   Get it on your iPod, your iPhone, even the zoom, your Kindle, many GPS devices, the, you
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:30.020]   know, the iRiver.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.100]   It is just fantastic.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.780]   I see a new EL doctoral novel.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.780]   This is great.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.100]   The front page just browse the front page.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.100]   It's like going to a bookstore.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:40.300]   They have, you know, lists of new releases, just added bestsellers.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.140]   They have staff picks.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.540]   They have picks from famous authors.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.420]   You can pre-order Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol, Get That Day and Date when the book comes
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.420]   out, that kind of thing.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.580]   It's just a really great little bookstore here online.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.420]   I have to say I've been, you know, Merlin Mann, when he was on a couple of weeks ago,
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.780]   recommended that writing down the bones, I know you concurred with him, Andy, and that's
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   been really great.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.900]   I've really been enjoying listening to that.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.420]   You have a pick for the week this weekend, Drew?
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.420]   Indeed, I do.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.420]   And it's a timely one.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:15.780]   It's called The Last Lion, The Fall and Rise of Ted Kennedy by Peter S. Canelo, C-A-N-E-L-L-O-S.
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:20.620]   It's a great, it's one of the definitive biographies of Senator Kennedy, chiefly because it's
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.620]   not some guy spent a year working on this book.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:29.180]   Essentially, it's the amalgamation of about 40, 50, 60s, sometimes even 70 years of the
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.340]   Boston Globes coverage of the Kennedy family.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.340]   Oh, wow.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:36.300]   It's extremely well-informed, multi-sourced.
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:41.980]   I think that if you had to choose between calling this an affectionate biography or an
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:46.300]   attack biography, forced to choose between two, you'd say it's affectionate because they
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:52.660]   put, I think that they correctly put Kennedy's rather serious problems in the correct light
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.300]   and the correct perspective.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.060]   They take a look at his entire life, not just.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.980]   I'm disappointed when I made some comments on my blog.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:04.380]   The negatives came for people who just knew Ted Kennedy as, "Oh, well, he was a boozer
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.060]   and a womanizer and he killed that woman in 1970."
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:11.140]   I went, "Okay, if that's really all you think about him, then that's probably the conclusion
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.140]   you'd make."
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.300]   Well, I'm not finished with it right yet.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.820]   I've gotten to...
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.660]   I'm basically at the start of The Last sort of act of his life.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:26.580]   You look at this guy's life and you wonder what a wonderful character, fictional character
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:34.300]   he would be in a novel where your dad was disappointed that because he grew up in Boston
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.380]   and he achieved political success and a great deal of wealth, but he knew he would never
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.140]   be respected because he's still the son of Irish immigrants.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:44.620]   He basically decided that his kid, one of his kids would be present, the first Catholic
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.340]   present, and that would teach everybody in Boston who refused to treat him with dignity
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.340]   and respect.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:53.700]   You're the youngest of all these kids, like nine or ten kids.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.860]   The oldest, you knew that your oldest brother, that he was going to be lined up to be president
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.020]   and he gets shot down in World War II and dies.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:05.580]   Okay, so then the next oldest brother gets lined up, he gets elected president, he gets
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.580]   assassinated.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.580]   Your next oldest brother is lined up to become president, he gets assassinated, and now your
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.980]   family, the entire Democratic Party, and the entire country is now putting you next in
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:21.340]   line for what is a very, very, very, very harrowing place for Kennedy to be.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.340]   What do you do next?
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.580]   What does that turn you to?
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.380]   What decisions do you face on that?
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:27.580]   I think he's just a fascinating, fascinating character.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:32.940]   There, again, he had a lot of problems that are very, very, very, that the book is very
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.140]   upfront about.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.700]   He has, there are a couple of things that he did in his life that he never really adequately
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.340]   addressed or apologized for.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:43.180]   But one of the things that you could really never impeach, I think, is his record in the
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:47.540]   Senate, which is, I mean, the stories, and this is actually a line for the book that
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.780]   every story that you come across about his drinking is womanizing.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:55.380]   It turns out that they're all true, no matter how far best they are, but also that you never
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.260]   can come up with instances in which, at his drinking and his womanizing, in any way, affected
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.940]   his role in the Senate, in which he consistently over a 40-year period, in which he entered
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:10.180]   the Senate with a reputation as, oh, he's just the president's kid who got shoved in because
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.380]   of his name.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:17.100]   40 years' reputation as the one person who would read not only the entire bill, but
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.420]   every piece of documentation, every piece of evidence he could get into.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.660]   I mean, people would look at the other people at the table would be looking to him because
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.660]   if he said something positive or negative about a certain bill, you may agree.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.100]   The other people in the Senate might have agreed with him or disagree with him, but
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.260]   they knew that, well, he knew his facts and that whatever the disagreements you might
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.820]   have, he probably has information that then this person needs to have.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.700]   Anyway, I think it very, very properly puts this entire life in a proper context.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.740]   I think that the next really great book won't be coming for another 10 years when everybody
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:52.340]   who was there in all of these rooms and in on all these decisions have now feel as though,
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.180]   well, the Senator's been dead for five years now.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:56.260]   I feel as though I can talk completely freely.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.220]   I think the next great book is going to be five or 10 years off, but for now, I think
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:03.300]   this is the best biography that we have of a very, very fascinating man, as someone who
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:08.580]   was very, very correctly well-beloved in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.580]   It's interesting because it's the same name that William Manchester gave his biography
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.420]   of Winston Churchill.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:19.220]   I think in a lot of ways, Kennedy reminds me of Churchill in both the flaws, the big
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.980]   flaws and the big achievements.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.060]   There's a lot to be said for comparing the two.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.060]   They're both were lions.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.060]   It's incredible.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.900]   A man of great personal, both his personal life and his professional life are separate
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.420]   and equal sometimes in their extremes.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   Bigger than life.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.420]   Great pick.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.300]   In fact, they've had Ted Kennedy, the dream that never died on the front page of Audible,
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.500]   the Edward Klein biography.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.620]   I think this sounds like this is the more in depth of the two.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.620]   But certainly you get to choose.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.540]   That's one of the beauties of Audible, audible.com/macbreak.

[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.580]   So pick wisely.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.780]   Oh, Grasapar.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.620]   And picking a book that you're going to enjoy.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.340]   I have a feeling it will open up a whole new world of listening enjoyment for you with
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.340]   Audible.com.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.140]   We just love them and I know you will too.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.100]   AUDIBLEaudible.com/macbreak.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.980]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:29.820]   A little birdie tells me that Scott Kurtz already has his pick ready.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:32.380]   Do you want to launch right into it, Mr. Kurtz?
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.380]   Sure, absolutely.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:38.300]   This is something that got turned on to me by the business manager over at Penny Arcade
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:44.060]   because as a cartoonist who does everything digitally, there used to be in my office,
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:49.780]   my studio with just a stack of Bristol board, you know, 10 by 4 bristles where I had drawn
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.980]   all the strips.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.580]   And so I didn't have to worry about back in that stuff up.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.580]   It was sitting right behind me.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.900]   I just have to scan it in again.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.220]   But I draw on a way Comps and Teak now.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.220]   Everything's digital.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.700]   Everything is done inside a Photoshop.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.700]   So nice.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:07.140]   So there are 10 years of my life, 10 years of my work.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:13.140]   It's all digital and it's all just moving from computer to hard drive with me.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.420]   So I'm terrified of losing it.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:21.940]   So as I've learned, any backup system is only as good as the person who doesn't remember
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:25.460]   to keep backing up.
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.900]   So I was introduced to something called Dropbox.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:33.740]   And Dropbox is a program that you can install on your Mac or even on your PC.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:37.620]   So if you work between two different platforms, it works on both.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:44.420]   But it installs on your Mac and it makes a folder in your Finder called Dropbox.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:49.820]   And anything that you keep in there is uploaded automatically in the background to your storage
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.940]   in the cloud.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.860]   So you can have any file system you want.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:59.260]   Just make sure it's in the Dropbox folder and it will not only does it do it as you create
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.380]   the files, but as you edit them, as you save them.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.540]   So as I'm working on a strip and maybe it takes me an hour to draw a comic strip and
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:11.140]   I save 10 times, every time I save it, it uploads the save.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.180]   The great thing about Dropbox is there's this web interface.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.940]   So if I'm away from my computer and I'm at a friend's house and I get a call from an
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:26.300]   editor that says that artwork you sent didn't go through the email, I can just log on Dropbox
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:30.540]   and either download it to my brother's computer and email it to him or just share the folder
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.420]   with him and tell him to go to Dropbox and download it himself.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.060]   So everything that's important on my hard drive that I need access to no matter where
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.820]   I go is accessible from the web.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.260]   And they're making an iPhone app too.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:50.940]   So yeah, so imagine if you're at the airport and you're going on a trip and your editor
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.180]   calls and you realize you didn't send something, you could just go to your iPhone and say,
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:59.380]   "Here's that file, sorry I didn't send it," even though it's sitting on your hard drive.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:03.660]   Now the really awesome thing about Dropbox is if you share a folder with someone and
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:07.980]   they put something into it, it downloads it in the background to your computer.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:13.900]   So when I make podcasts with my buddy Brad Geiger who does another comic, we each record
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:22.420]   our voice locally and I have a shared folder that he uploads his half of the podcast to
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.980]   and then all of a sudden I just want it when it's time to make it, it's on my hard drive.
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.540]   It's just on my computer because it all happened in the background.
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.700]   It's all automatic and you don't have to think about it.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.580]   So you'll never forget to back up with Dropbox.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.580]   I love it.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:40.060]   You know, we have all these FTP solutions and stuff and we have free FTP servers because
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.220]   we have NASs and so forth.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.420]   We ended up just using Dropbox.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.820]   I got a 50 gig Dropbox.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.100]   That's what we use to get your files off to you, Alex.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.100]   Yeah, it works great.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.020]   You do shows in here.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.420]   We do, yeah, lose it all the time.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.860]   I don't use it like you do this, Scott.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:56.060]   That's interesting as you kind of use it instead of your eye disc as a way to back up.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   That's a good idea.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.060]   Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:02.700]   The first thing is if you put your Dropbox folder on your Drobo, then it's like triple
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.060]   quadruple backed up.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.060]   Right.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.300]   That's a really good idea.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.660]   I hadn't thought about that.
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.820]   Since in the cloud minutes across for one terabyte hard drive too.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:12.820]   Right.
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:13.820]   Good pick.
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:14.820]   Thank you.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:15.820]   Get dropbox.com.
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:18.620]   It's free for the first what one or two gigs.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.420]   I can't have five gigs and then you could buy more storage.
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:22.420]   It's not very expensive.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.420]   No, we bought 50 gigs.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:24.420]   No, it's not expensive at all.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.420]   I use it like crazy.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.260]   In fact, we're probably going to have to buy some more.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:36.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:38.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.260]   I'm going to buy some more.

[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.260]   I'm going to buy some more.

[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.260]   I'm going to buy some more.

[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:10.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.260]   I'm going to buy some more.

[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.260]   I'm going to buy some more.

[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:32.260]   I'm going to buy some more.

[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:35.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:36.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:37.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:44.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:50.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:58.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.260]   I'm going to buy some more.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:06.900]   If you order now, at least I got for free the Super Bay external drive.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.940]   I took my super drive and put it into an external drive.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.660]   I still have.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.060]   I could install Snow Leopard from the disc.
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:16.980]   Although I still have a slot on my laptop.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:18.980]   You try to put something in there and just do it.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.500]   There's a hard drive right on the other side of the slot.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.660]   This is working great.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.220]   There are a couple of negatives, obviously.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.220]   Battery life is depleted.
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.700]   The heat doesn't seem to be a problem using the Apple drive.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.900]   I have to say, it does not get any hotter.
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:36.340]   It's great now because I have 128 gig boot drive that's very, very fast.
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:39.740]   I store all my data on the 320 second drive.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:40.980]   I've got two drives in my laptop.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:42.620]   It's a really nice compromise.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.900]   I didn't use the super drive all that much.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.220]   If I need it, I can still burn and read discs in the super drive externally.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:53.860]   One caveat on this though, Apple's DVD player is designed to only work with an internal
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:54.860]   drive.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.580]   You have to use VLC or something else to play back DVDs.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.180]   You can't use Apple's software.
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.180]   I haven't tried it.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:04.820]   I have from Abbe's MacBook Air, I have the external DVD drive, the Apple branded one.
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.220]   I bet you would play back from that.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:08.580]   I've never actually watched the DVD on my...
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.580]   Exactly!
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:10.580]   ...on the laptop.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   I've never actually watched it.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:12.580]   Exactly!
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:13.580]   Why waste the space?
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:14.580]   Right.
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.580]   I mean, it's useful for backup to burn a DVD.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.580]   It's great for installing.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:17.580]   So you haven't lost it.
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:20.060]   You haven't as an external USB drive.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.860]   This is $129 from mcetech.com.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:26.460]   Installation on my unibody 15 was not difficult.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.820]   It does come with a screwdriver of the right size.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.820]   It's not Torx.
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:30.820]   It's a regular screw.
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:34.780]   You open up the port, you take out the battery.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.820]   You don't have to take out the main drive.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   And then there are about six screws around the edges of that aluminum unibody that you
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.820]   remove.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:43.820]   And there it is, the drive's right there.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:44.820]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:47.900]   You have to remove a couple of connectors from the motherboard.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.780]   Put them on the new body and bingo.
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:53.140]   What's odd though, and it feels a little strange.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.700]   The new bait does not get screwed down into it.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:59.860]   It's just held in place by the metal lid, which feels a little weird to me, but it works.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.500]   But you don't hear it doesn't sound like that.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.500]   There's no rattle.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.100]   There's no perceptible heat issue.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.940]   It seems completely reliable.
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.380]   And now I've got a lot more storage.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.180]   And I still get my SSD drive.
[01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.180]   So I think that's a good combination.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:15.460]   See, I want to get the 256 SSD drive and then put a 500, a 2,200 RPM.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.460]   Exactly.
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.860]   Then you got a lot of storage in there.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.460]   Then you could lose a lot of data if you drop your back.
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.460]   Back up.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:25.460]   You should also...
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:26.900]   I want to lose all my data.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:32.300]   You should also be aware that their battery life is depleted a little bit.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.340]   Not a whole lot, but maybe 20%, 30%.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.100]   So you're not going to get the good battery life because you're running two drives.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.100]   Although the...
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.580]   I have to check that because I'm running a solid state drive as my primary drive.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:48.420]   I bet you it's not reducing my battery life much over what it would be.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:56.500]   So that's my pick, the MCE Tech Up to Be for $129 from MCE Tech.com.
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.500]   That's great.
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.020]   Thanks to whoever recommended that in the chat room.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.980]   It was a really great suggestion.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.140]   I was whining about...
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.300]   People apparently can use it RAID.
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.460]   Some complain it says a rating drives this way.
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.380]   I had thought about it.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:12.660]   I had seen this come by earlier and I had known it actually used it.
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:13.820]   I had thought about creating a RAID.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.940]   But I kind of have a rule about not having my startup drive on a RAID.
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.940]   It's kind of a recipe for disaster.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:21.940]   Well thank you everybody.
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.940]   We appreciate your time.
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:28.460]   Thank you Scott Kurtz, PVPOnline.com, the great webcomic, the greatest of all webcomics.
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:29.460]   Scott, you're...
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:30.660]   Mmm, debatable, but thank you.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.700]   It's great to have you on the show.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.700]   We really appreciate your time.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.140]   I appreciate it.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:38.940]   Of course Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core, our good friend at PixelCore.tv.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:39.940]   Thank you.
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.620]   And points west.
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:45.500]   And definitely check out the...
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.900]   All the stuff you check out with Macbreak Video, really check out the stuff for me.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:48.900]   I'm going to watch that.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.700]   I'm going to watch that.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.700]   It's really...
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.220]   It's this week we'll have another two more...
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.220]   We have one that came out yesterday.
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:59.700]   I want another two more this week and it's just you really got to see what's possible.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:00.700]   Thank you.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.700]   Thank you for that.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.580]   I'll watch that and maybe I'll feel better.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:07.140]   And Annie and I go, "Thanks for talking me down dude."
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.300]   I'm just here for you sir.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:09.300]   I have got your...
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:17.740]   Well not your back, but we'll talk about what part I have of yours.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:19.740]   It's a different part than the part Apple has apparently.
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.020]   My contract is coming back up.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.020]   Chicago sometimes.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.260]   This celestial waste of bandwidth C-W-O-B dot com.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.780]   All right everybody back to work.
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.620]   Break time is over.
