[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.680]   And since everyone is in Vegas, we had to go to Liverpool.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.040]   Don McAllister is here.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040]   Screencasts online.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.040]   Hey, Don.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040]   Hi, hi, hi.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   It's like looking at the word image now.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   It's amazing.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   It's amazing.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   It's well in the head.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.040]   I left my mustache somewhere, but I'll get it.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   I actually liked it with the shirt.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040]   It was a bit of a hit.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.760]   I did this as you know, and I just have to, I probably have to explain it all week, but
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.560]   I did this on our New Year's Eve show Marathon, Telethon, to raise money for a UNICEF.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080]   And so it was a very good cause.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   We ended up raising $75,000 between the cash donations and the auction.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.040]   So very good, very exciting, very fun.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   New Year's Eve.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.880]   And every one of those hours, all 24 of them, is available on our website at twit.tv/specials.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.200]   He was also here, and he did a fun mexology segment involving liquid nitrogen.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.080]   You know, not really mixing until you've got your mixing with liquid nitrogen.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.920]   I think that's taken it to the next level.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920]   You know what?
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.440]   While Leo was shaving his head, I was drinking.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.240]   It should have been the other way around.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240]   I wish it had been.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.440]   You shave your head every year, don't you?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   I used to.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.960]   You're clipping it anyway.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   I used to clip it all the time.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.880]   I used to shave it when I married my wife.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.040]   It was, I bicked it every day.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.600]   That's the term, the technical term, "bicking it."
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.240]   Although if you use a bick to shave your head, you are asking it for trouble.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   And a lot of nicks.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   A hair is at the very least.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   I had trained professional.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   I should use, I should.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.240]   With a straight razor.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   Yeah, that's my one.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.680]   So, she persuaded me to actually grow it out.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   So, there you go.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.840]   And you would just do that every year, and that would be your haircut.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.440]   I would do it every couple of days.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   Oh, oh, you kept it shaved.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.680]   Then when I started clipping it, then I would clip it, and about every three months I'd
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.040]   clip it again.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.840]   Now I just cut it short.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   I like short.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   And I do too.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   I think short's easiest.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.280]   No hole in the front of my head now.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.480]   This might be a little too short.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.680]   You just see it.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.920]   That's Andy, and I coat from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.840]   Not a CES Andy, you're not a CES fan.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.080]   No, because, I mean, if you're like Renee, and you had like a site like I'm more where
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.480]   your readers expect you to absolutely have news about everything, then that's important
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   to be there.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.840]   Otherwise, as I said on Twitter, it's all like, you know, Bluetooth.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   It's all vaporware and Bluetooth shoelaces.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.240]   That's like for everything.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720]   And I mean, all week long, it's been like emails.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.640]   Hey, I got some time available with such and such a person if you want to like talk to
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   him.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.280]   Said, oh, actually I'm not a CES, but is he going to be in the Cambridge office in a
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   few weeks?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   Sure.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   Great.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   Let's talk to him.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   Oh, right.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   That's good because he'll be rested and he'll be fed and he'll be more alert.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   Great.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   Absolutely.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.080]   So, you know, the benefit, of course, of a show like international CES is everybody's
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   there.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.880]   It's all in one spot, but it's so hard to get around because everybody's there and everything.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.800]   I think it really is like San Diego Comic Con where it's so big that you can't see the
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   whole show.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.240]   So what you have to treat it as you have to decide that the show that you want to attend
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.920]   is inside there somewhere.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   So if you decide that you want to go to the HDTV Consumer Electronics Show, you can definitely
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.920]   see the HDTV Consumer Electronics Show where now everybody's doing curved screens, not
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.560]   just Samsung, or you can go to the Wearables CES and you can definitely do that.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.680]   But you really certainly can't cover the entire thing, not as a one person, man.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.200]   So we should say Renee's not here because he's at CES.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.280]   Next week we'll talk about what he saw at CES, but they took the same South stage.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   Remember this?
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.680]   This is the stage where we used to have our booth and it is he's doing it with Mobile
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.040]   Nations, his company, GeekBTV, Callie Lewis's company, Tom's Hardware.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.840]   And so they're going to do pretty much, you know, I think the kind of thing that we did,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.120]   they've got the reporters.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.480]   There's a serenity called.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.040]   Well, Callie Lewis.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.080]   I feel like, uh, Georgia Dow, he's a very lucky fella to be doing this.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.520]   So there he is in Vegas.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   We miss you Renee.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.560]   Have a great time and come back bearing Chachkis and lee, whatever disgusting flu-like symptoms
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   you have.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.000]   Oh, try to keep that within your lower third.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.680]   It's, it's, I'll confess a little FOMO fear of missing out.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.480]   I feel like it's all going on down there.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.960]   We have coverage Renee is down there, but also Father Robert Baliser is covering it.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.840]   We've got Dick D. Bartolo, the Gizwiz doing the kind of, he likes to do that.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.160]   Like weird gadgets in the basement and Scott Wilbur.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.200]   I think that CES has long needed the liturgical perspective on things.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.560]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.800]   I was trying to think of what Robert's beat.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.440]   And it's what everyone said.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   Yeah, I did it last year for the first time.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   It was on my bucket list to do.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   I remember it.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   I've done it before.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.040]   So yeah, well, it was in New Media Expo and it followed on last year.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   So I stayed over for an extra couple of days and it was good.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   But it's so overwhelming.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   There's so much stuff there.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.800]   And I did find that the things I wanted to see, um, a couple of the booze was like invitation
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   only.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   And of course I didn't arrange anything in advance.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.000]   So some of the things I wanted to see I couldn't actually see.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.160]   But, uh, I think it's worth doing at least once, but it is very, very overwhelming.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   There's so much stuff down there.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.440]   It's so much, so much floor space to cover as well.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   I believe it will.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440]   So much stuff is never released.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.920]   It's hard because it's hard to see it overall overarching story.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.440]   Although certainly TV is the big story.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.600]   The other thing is Apple's not there.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.000]   And in years past, I could think of several years, 2010, when they released the iPad 2007,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   when they released the iPhone, where everybody, you know, I see, yes, is talking about Apple.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.320]   And it's like Apple was the big story, even though they weren't there.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   They're not there again.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.360]   This year, Microsoft's not there either, by the way.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.280]   Yeah, I think Chinese TV company, HySense has taken over there.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   It's been over the last few years.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.520]   That's another reason why it's no longer really important for even for many tech journalists
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.400]   to go because all these companies now, they would much rather have their own event where
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.880]   they have all the attention and they can release something on their own schedule.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.840]   So it's probably cost less money for me to travel to New York a couple of times in San
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.000]   Francisco a couple of times than to spend a week in Las Vegas.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.840]   And I think for the larger companies that are already well established, it doesn't make
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   as much sense.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.400]   For the little companies, it's great because it, you know, especially for the some of the
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.600]   press events that have it on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday nights, it gives you a chance where
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.960]   you have a little 10 by 10 booth and you're walking around kind of getting to see a bunch
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.560]   of the stuff quickly.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.920]   But even then I felt like even last year, other than a handful of things, I wasn't sure
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.120]   if I needed to be there.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.280]   Yeah, wearables will be big.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.680]   And again, this is a case of wearables, you'll be big until Apple's, Apple Watch comes
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.440]   out and then everything all throw it all out up in the air because it's all now going
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   to change.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.000]   We are just seeing some home, you know, some of the home automation is going to be, I think
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   is interesting.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.880]   I was hoping, you know, Samsung had some announcements.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.080]   They updated the SmartThings hub.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   Belkin did.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   Yes, that's some integration.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   Yeah, I've got a lot of home kit announcements of companies who are willing to announce that
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.320]   hey, we're finally ready to announce home kit and we're at least willing to show off
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.000]   how integration is going to work.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.960]   But not to call play announcements as well, which is good.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   Yeah, that's good too.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.320]   So there's some other stuff there.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.800]   And then I guess in TVs it's quantum dots and curved screens and 4K.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.080]   And that's all you really need to know.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.240]   The rest of us just know is we will have a very complete report on TV and home theater
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.000]   from Scott Wilkinson on this home theater geeks this week.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   He does this every year and I've done it a couple of years with him.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   It's really funny.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.840]   Goes to all the major television booths and talks to Sony and Sharp and Samsung and LG
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.200]   and I hope we'll talk to TC on in high sense the hot and up and coming Chinese companies
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   as well.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   Very thin.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   Thin.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.920]   Thin is, you always say thin.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   It's like an iPad.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.800]   If they're ever been a thicker iPad, I started looking like impossibly thin.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.720]   I mean, you see the Sony, they said it's thinner than the iPhone.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   Colly.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   Wow.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   That's thin.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   Colly.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.920]   Well, here is a big story from Mark Gurman, an exclusive on 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:37.720]   Apple's next major Mac revealed the radically new 12 inch Mac book air.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.680]   Take this with a grain of salt although Gurman is extraordinarily well connected.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.320]   He says sources within Apple who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.080]   computer provided in depth details.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.200]   These are artists, renditions on the web page.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:59.640]   And if you're watching video on our video of the revamped Mac book air, but here's some
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   of the facts.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.960]   No longer will they have full size USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots, markedly
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.560]   thinner and lighter with a higher resolution display.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.240]   Sounds almost like a retina iPad with a keyboard.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.640]   The 12 inch will be considerably smaller than the current 13 inch version, slightly narrower
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.040]   than the 11 inch model.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.880]   The new 12 inches approximately a quarter of an inch narrower than the 11 inch version,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.880]   which is nice.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.280]   I mean, it's nice to get it smaller, but that doesn't change the aspect ratio of the screen,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   by the way.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:40.240]   It's a quarter of inch taller to accommodate the slightly larger display.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.920]   Bessels on the display have just been reduced.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.440]   That's what changes the outside.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.240]   Besides the new look for the computer, this is Mark Gurman again, a 9 to 5 Mac, an exclusive
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.080]   story of the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.640]   making cues from the 12 inch power book introduced more than a decade ago by Steve Jobs.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.440]   The new keyboard goes edge to edge.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.840]   Look at this is again an artist rendering from 9 to 5 Mac, but look at that, edge to
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   edge.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.080]   The entire key set subtly redesigned so each key says noticeably closer together.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.840]   Apple squeezed the keys closer to get the computer as narrow as possible.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   Do you buy this Andy?
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   You sound skeptical.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:27.600]   Well, this is just a rumor and all Apple rumors that are made more than a week before.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.080]   We know that there's an Apple announcement.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:35.000]   I tend to think, okay, this is more fodder for an interesting discussion about what hypothetically
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.240]   how this sort of thing would work.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.520]   So with that said, this sounds like a turkey of a product.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.880]   I want the USB port at least.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.160]   It sounds like this is something where there are going to be so many inconveniences.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.080]   If it's not as easy to type with as a real Mac, there's going to be a lot of people.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.280]   There would be a lot of people asking, okay, so if you're charging, if I bet they're going
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.360]   to be charging the same sort of price point for it, I can't imagine they're going to charge
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.920]   iPad like prices for something like this.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.680]   I think that the first question to ask is, why would I buy this instead of say a Chromebook
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.880]   for $500 less?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.280]   Or why would I buy this instead of you're probably in the same price range as a very
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:22.760]   good Windows notebook that would have more ports than the device that 9 to 5 Mac is describing?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.920]   If a keyboard, I'm already kind of disappointed with the things that I have my 13 inch MacBook
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   Pro.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.320]   I'm disappointed with the keyboard because it's okay to type with, but it's no better
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.040]   than any keyboard I would find on a computer that costs $1,000 less.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   I would be quite surprised if they decided to take a gamble on spacing of keys like that
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.080]   because that's especially for something as trivial as we just don't want to have anything
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.720]   on the left and to the right of this keyboard.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.400]   And also we know that people are clamoring for if we made this so that it was one half
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.160]   inch wider, one quarter inch wider on either side, people would be looking at us and telling
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.240]   us that we're nuts to make a computer that's one quarter inch wider on either side.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.640]   So I'm not saying I don't believe it.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.680]   I'm saying that I see a lot of things that if this were a proposed design that someone
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.280]   was showing me and saying we're thinking about going this direction, I would say, okay, if
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.240]   it's a $500 computer, very interesting.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.640]   It gets less interesting by 20% with every $100 over $500 though.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.080]   German points out that this is a prototype may not be the released product.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.000]   Apple does change things sometimes.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.360]   But look at the ports on this.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.520]   According to the specs he has, on the left side, there's a headset port and two built
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.680]   in little holes for microphones on the right side, one port, no mag safe adapter, no USB.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.880]   It's the new USB type C, which is everything.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.680]   It is a USB port.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:54.720]   It is a display port, a Thunderbolt port and a power port.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   Obviously, you can't use those all at the same time.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   Maybe you get a hub or something, a dock.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   So basically, I think Apple is shifting its business plan to we're basically the company
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.520]   that sells dongles.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.760]   But it is, it is, happily, you have the feeling if this such a thing, it existed in Steve's
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.120]   time, Mr. One Button Mouse, he would have liked the One Port computer.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.560]   I'd be more understanding if you could, if you could do touchscreen and take the keyboard
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.680]   off than I'd love to see a touchscreen on this.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.320]   I mean, this, if this, if this were for instance, a keyboarded iPad design, that becomes fascinating.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.280]   And the idea of having, let's say, just one lightning connector for everything that also
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.600]   becomes really, really interesting.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.840]   It seems less interesting as a MacBook, though.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.920]   Room ones, wait until for the MacBook, you know, the, the rest of the MacBook Air is something
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.520]   that everyone is salivating for.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.120]   And it seems a bit weird that they would forgo with the standard Thunderbolt cable and, you
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.720]   know, just have the single port sounds a little bit fission to me.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.200]   This is a mid 2015 product.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.520]   Again, this is exclusive to Mark Gurman 905 Mac who is well connected, but this is.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.040]   Well, but rumors are rumors.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   Something that's not a rumor.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.680]   Even, even if this were like, it looks, the, the specs were, this looks exactly like the,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.000]   the 11 inch MacBook Air with the same connectors and just a different aspect ratio and a different
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   screen.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.760]   I have to say that even then I'd be saying, I'm not going to buy any rumor until, you know,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.280]   this, this far out.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.440]   So it's possible that this is just something they built just to figure out what would this
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.640]   be like and what this, you need, you need to dog food your own products on a wide scale
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.160]   before you can consider rolling it out.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.040]   So especially if they were doing something as radical as changing the spacing of a keyboard.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.280]   So I wouldn't be, I don't, I don't doubt that a device just like this exists inside Apple.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.920]   I just don't know if it's being seriously fast tracked as the one of the next MacBook
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.640]   sets all M5 in the chat room makes a good point.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:52.680]   The touchscreen on a Mac would have to, you'd have to have some modifications to the UI.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.440]   For instance, the, the window buttons are so small, you probably couldn't tap those with
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   your finger.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.320]   They're useful.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.840]   We all have, have tried out things like the Chromebook Pixel and Windows devices that
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.560]   have touch screens on them.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.600]   And even if it's not, even if it's not optimized for touch, it's still quite useful.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.640]   I was surprised after my first couple of days with the Chromebook Pixel, how quickly I kind
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.040]   of transitioned to every time I scroll casually, I just would just sort of like put my hand
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.640]   up and just like rest my, rest my hand next to the screen and start doing this to scroll.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.200]   I just don't think Apple's a sort of company that would say, well, what the hell let's
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.280]   do a touchscreen and it'll be useful for some things, but not all things.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.880]   I think Apple would say, no, we're not going to do a touchscreen desktop OS until we rejigger
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.080]   the entire operating system to be multi-touch.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.640]   And why don't we preview that if you're curious as also, you can use the duet display, you
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.200]   know, the new little thing.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.480]   Yeah, you showed that last week.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.920]   I showed that and you can hook it up and then it actually, it makes sure I've had, you
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.520]   know, basically it was a touchscreen.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   It's almost 12 inches.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.760]   So you can really get a sense of what a touchscreen would be like.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.920]   And I guess for me, I want to mark stuff up and I just don't want to use my mouse.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.520]   And so like I'm looking at something, I want to be able to circle it and pooze.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.800]   I don't need it to, I don't need to have full control.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.560]   I definitely understand that Apple, I agree with Andy, Apple probably is going to wait
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.360]   until they have a full solution for that.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.240]   But I find, I mean, every time I see a Windows surface, I have to admit, I get closer and
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.720]   closer to like, oh, well, maybe I'll get one of those.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.360]   You know, because it's just, it's getting to the point, Apple sometimes is a little behind
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   the curve.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.840]   I'm trying to make it perfect and I think that I'm starting to get to the outside edge of
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.720]   my patients because it's just something that I would use all day every day.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   Some of the chat room suggests that maybe this is making the, they are more of a kind
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.080]   of not a full, more like an iPad, quite a full service computer, but a extremely portable
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.080]   computer.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.160]   And then maybe you would still want a MacBook Pro versus for the heavy duty mobile computer.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.520]   But I don't think people have that kind of money.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.760]   I think if somebody's going to buy a laptop, they're going to buy one and only one laptop.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.200]   I think you really have to be committed to the cloud.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.240]   I have an 11 inch that I carry around as well as my MacBook Pro and I just find that my
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.080]   usable is too small.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   I don't find it.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   Oh, Jason still loves his 11 inch.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.600]   So yeah, I just find it hard to answer the question of what what complaints do people
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.680]   who buy the 11 inch of the 13 inch MacBook Air have that will be solved by this design.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.200]   I certainly see an explanation for why 11 inch and 13 inch customers would want to rent
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.160]   a screen because especially with Yosemite, it looks so much better and so much more used
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.600]   to be usable on a retina display.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.840]   That's certainly where Apple wants to take all of their Macs.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.040]   But I don't see it.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.240]   I just don't hear people saying if only this were even narrower, if only this were even
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240]   thinner.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   So it's.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.600]   Yeah, but we didn't say about the iPad.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   They did that too.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.760]   Yeah, but Apple seems to fetishize thinness.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   They absolutely do that.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.040]   And sometimes I sometimes I think at the wrong cost.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.720]   But the difference is that they could make the iPad thinner without changing one Iota
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.640]   of the experience of using this device or the actual tactile experience of using like
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.680]   the actual software because the screen is still there.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.840]   The screen is still still made up hard glass.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.600]   They didn't make it like the texture of chicken feathers or anything like that.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.720]   Whereas if they were to make sacrifice like saying we want it.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.600]   We are so it's so important to make this the the narrowest MacBook ever and the thinnest
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.000]   MacBook ever that we're going to make every single keystroke feel like you're just sort
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.240]   of suggesting what letter you would like them act to sort of maybe put into that window.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.280]   If they were to sacrifice that at all, then you're suddenly having a lot of people saying
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.360]   why am I spending money on something that if if I'm buying this because instead of an
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.240]   iPad because I need to be able to type and do actual work on this, why am I spending
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.440]   this money to buy a new device that makes it actually less comfortable to work with.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   What if it's Apple's Chromebook?
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.440]   What if it's cheap?
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.840]   If it's relatively inexpensive, I think it's interesting.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   Now he's worth it.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   Yeah, at five hundred dollars is really interesting.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.760]   We got a product here.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.440]   You got it now?
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   Okay.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.680]   I see I can't help but say but say Leo that if I were like a store manager and I saw
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.640]   you walking to the store, I would assume you were with Dateline NBC.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.760]   There was a camera hidden inside those glasses.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.600]   I have a big clipboard like this to say.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.160]   So tell me how often do you sell this product into whom?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.280]   No, if this were a 500 well what would be a Chromebook price for Apple?
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.800]   It's not going to be 250 which is the actual Chromebook.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   400.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.080]   That would be an amazing deal, right?
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   Yeah, 400 or $500.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.520]   Would this then be worthwhile?
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.600]   Like, well, okay, I get it.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.160]   This is the inexpensive student computer.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.520]   I'm sorry, don't you have to say?
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   Okay.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.320]   If they're about if they're pricing, it's like an iPad, then yeah, this would be an incredible
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   device.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.560]   If you're if they were trying to tell customers that there are we know there are a lot of
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.800]   people who are buying iPads and using it in ways that iPads are not intended to be used
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   for.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.600]   This is why we are giving you this $599 entry level MacBook and also a way to make the Mac
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.840]   more more affordable for the general population.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   That would be fantastic.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.160]   That would be worth whatever a bunch of sacrifices in design.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.040]   But again, I just have a hard time imagining this right now.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.240]   Now one thing that's not imaginary or rumor or fiction is the new Intel chips.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.760]   And traditionally when an Intel comes out with new chips, Apple is really, really quite
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.760]   quickly ready to jump on it.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.720]   In this case, Intel showed these new Broadwell processors with Dell computers, not Apple
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   computers.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.960]   So Dell has jumped on it.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.840]   A lot of people have been waiting for Broadwell.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   It's actually delayed.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.640]   It was supposed to be out I think September 14 nanometers.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.720]   That's kind of unbelievably tiny.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.520]   That's down from 22 nanometers possibly on the Haswells.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.080]   14, I don't know.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.280]   You're getting close to zero now.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.720]   I don't know how low you can go.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.680]   Unfortunately, electrons keep getting jammed up at it because it's just the thing for the
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   electrons.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.400]   It's a log.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:54.280]   There are the CES Intel talked about 14 new Broadwell series chips for both laptop and
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:03.600]   desktop, including 13 15 watt processors with basic Intel HD graphics, four 28 watt models
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.040]   with iris graphics as the higher end Intel graphics.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.580]   I five and I seven, although this is fifth generation now.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.980]   This is the new generation.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.920]   And there are some mid range I three less expensive I three variants, although Intel
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.540]   also announced new Adams, lower and Pentium and Celeron series chips too.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.460]   So there's a very wide range of pricing.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.700]   All of these so far are dual core, not quad core and high risk pro.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.820]   The highest end motherboard graphic on chip graphics set is not yet available until the
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.820]   middle of the year.
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:47.100]   This is a this is a this is a ticker a talk.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.020]   I think this is a tick.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.160]   So small performance boost, but amazing process reduction 14.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.740]   Reason that's important 14 nanometers is it means it uses less power, less heat, and
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.100]   it's so more efficient.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.540]   So not much faster until saying that for percent boost in productivity oriented applications,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.540]   according to system mark.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:17.340]   So it's a tiny boost in power in performance, but an incredible boost, I'm sure in energy
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.340]   savings.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.980]   Yeah, it's interesting when you have new chips that don't just make things faster, but a lot
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.900]   enable a whole new category of devices to come out.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.340]   Microsoft is really trying to push the idea of having seven and eight inch tablets that
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.980]   run actual windows, not just run mobile apps, but you actually just want to run real
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.660]   Microsoft office, real Photoshop on these things.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.580]   And that's certainly going to help both those things out.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.900]   And here's an interesting piece from the Intel press release.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.940]   These machines will have fewer wires.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.780]   Broadwell chips will support a variety of technologies that eliminate the need for cables
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.300]   and ports, including Intel wireless gigabit docking and the next generation of Intel's
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:01.740]   wireless display technology, which can support 4k for with these fifth generation processes.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:08.780]   And that might be more what we're talking about seeing with our 12 inch.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.580]   And I do think that there was someone mentioned in the chat room, the sensitivity to USB.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.860]   I think that USB has to be compromised.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.860]   Security-wise.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.340]   Thunderbolt might be compromised as well.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:27.500]   And so connecting hardware to your computer may be something that we do less and less.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:34.700]   You're talking about the security researcher who claims he rewrote the firmware on a Macintosh
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.500]   through Thunderbolt.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   Wow.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   Wow.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   Concerning.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.340]   And says most Intel Thunderbolt Macs are vulnerable.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.460]   He was speaking at the Chaos Computer Congress in Hamburg.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.460]   It's a hack that rewrites the Macs firmware using a Thunderbolt device with a TAC code
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.420]   in an option ROM.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.500]   He calls this because it's very important these days to have a good name for your exploit
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.980]   if you want coverage.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.980]   Thunder strike.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:05.500]   We need like an echo there.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.340]   So that's extremely bad news.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.500]   Well, especially because it looked like Thunderbolt was going to be something that was a little
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.380]   safer than USB, which I think is a way to be more formally compromised.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.580]   It has direct memory access, which is the real problem.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.580]   Right.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.820]   It says you can access memory through a cable.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.300]   You probably are in trouble.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:30.420]   This installed thunder strike firmware cannot be removed because it replaces the Apple key,
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.540]   which means further firmware updates will be denied unless signed by the attackers private
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.820]   key.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.100]   The hacked firmware can also replicate by copying itself to option ROMs and other Thunderbolt
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.500]   devices connected to the compromised Mac during a restart.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   These devices continue to work just normally, but so you don't know they've been modified.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.420]   But of course, does require physical access to your Mac.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.860]   You actually have to plug, but you know, that's what this bad USB required physical access
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.900]   to a USB port.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.860]   Right.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.420]   So there you go.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.940]   Something to look forward to.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.940]   Thunder strike coming soon to a CPU near you.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.940]   Andy Inako is here.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.100]   Renee Richie from Liverpool, Don McAllister.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.260]   Renee Richie's not here in his place.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.220]   I don't know why that's automatic in his place.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.340]   Don McAllister from Liverpool, England, the creator of screencasts online.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.060]   He's not going to do Mac Manie anymore.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:30.500]   Yeah, I know they did have one lined up for the end of the year, but yeah, unfortunately
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.500]   they got pulled.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   So that's a shame.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   We'll have to do our own.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:39.660]   With the folding of Mac World Magazine, Neil Bauman, Cam Neil, we call him, formerly Geek
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.380]   Cruises now in Psych Cruises, says there's, you know, he used to do these in conjunction
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.900]   with Mac World Magazine and they'd give him a full page layout.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   Everything says, I can't pay for that anymore.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.580]   So he's just says they're going to, he's doing Scientific American and astronomy stuff.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.100]   It's that we should do our own, shouldn't we?
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.100]   Let's talk.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.100]   Okay.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   Because you know, it's a big, it's funny.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.820]   It seems like it's the same people or at least like 50% of the same people each time.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.220]   Well, we're actually, we are going off to, we're going on a trip in March with some of
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.460]   the people that we know from the people.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.460]   See?
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.460]   Yeah, see.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.460]   So we're, I want to go.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.460]   I haven't gone yet.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.460]   This is Wally's trip to India.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.460]   That's right.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.460]   You're doing that?
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.460]   I am indeed.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.460]   I want to find you.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.540]   It's going to be a busy two, two months because we've got to prepare all this stuff
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.300]   before we go because I think going to be away for about three and a half weeks.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   So, yes, it's going to be tough.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:36.100]   If you do this cruise, if you keep your head shaved, you can do the whole Captain
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   Stupping thing.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.100]   Where's Gopher?
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.740]   Gopher, come here.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:46.460]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle the Fast and Simple Way to Sell Your Used Gadgets.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.940]   You can go and get a new gadget or did you get a new gadget for the holidays?
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.060]   Or maybe you didn't and now you're going to go get one.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.220]   A new iPhone 6, perhaps?

[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.540]   want to get rid of your old Galaxy or your old iPad or MacBook trading in your old devices
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.540]   after the holidays.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.940]   It's like getting a second gift.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.020]   They'll pay you cash.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.860]   And by the way, if you've wondered what happens to those devices you sell, well, the very
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   best of them, the Cream De La Creme will be available from Gazelle.

[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   and certified good.

[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:54.580]   I'll show some gentle signs of wear, but you'll save even more money and it'll be a great
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.900]   device and a great price in both certified like new and certified good have been put
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.380]   through a rigorous 30-point inspection to make sure they're fully functional and of

[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.540]   It's just gathering dust.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.700]   What's your iPhone worth?

[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.900]   device and that's nice.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.900]   It gives you time to think.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.220]   Gazelle dot com.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.380]   We thank you so much for making a great service and for supporting Mac break weekly.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:53.460]   Did you all read Marco Arment's piece on Marco dot org?
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.740]   Marco is of course the creator of Insta paper.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.740]   He was the first programmer at Tumblr, made some money when Tumblr got sold to Yahoo and
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.540]   has been just kind of I think become kind of, he's been thinking.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.580]   He's become kind of the grand philosopher of the Mac world.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.900]   He's also a still a developer.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.380]   In fact, his overcast podcast program is quite good quite as you would expect from Marco.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.540]   Quite beautiful.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.380]   But he wrote a piece on his website.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:22.100]   He's actually since said, I kind of regret it.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.420]   Apple has lost the functional high ground.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.860]   I suppose before I read this piece from January 4th, I should read the piece he wrote the
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.420]   next day.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.940]   What it's like to be way too popular for a day.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.340]   He says people misquoted him.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.340]   His words were everywhere.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.580]   Chopped up and twisted by sensational opportunists to fuel the tired.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:48.060]   Apple is doomed narrative with my name on it.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.780]   Marco, welcome to the club.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.140]   I wrote a piece about Android last year that we've all been there.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.340]   But Marco, I'll tell you why it's important.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.100]   And the same thing with you, Andy.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:04.060]   Marco is so firmly associated with the Apple name.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:10.620]   In summary, what he wrote was I think not completely wrong, which is that Apple has become more
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.580]   of a marketing driven company.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.100]   And because of that, software quality has suffered.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.300]   He says, hardware is just as good as ever.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.100]   But the software quality suffered particularly because he believes marketing has demanded
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.660]   every year a new OS X.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.460]   Every year a new OS, iOS.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.820]   And they just having a major new release every year, he writes is clearly impossible
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:39.180]   for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.740]   They're doing too much with unrealistic deadlines and he blames marketing.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.780]   I fear that Apple's leadership doesn't realize quite how badly and deeply their software
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.100]   flaws have damaged their reputation.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:54.340]   Because if they realized it, they'd make serious changes that don't appear to be happening.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.780]   Instead the opposite appears to be happening.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:01.940]   The pace of rapid updates on multiple product lines seems to be expanding and accelerating.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.780]   Comments?
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.460]   I don't necessarily completely disagree.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:13.940]   I feel like the last truly stable version of OS X was 10.8.6.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.340]   I think that it's been Mavericks.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.460]   That was, I think, almost unusable in my opinion from a production perspective and your somebody
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.100]   is better.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.460]   But we just saw so many problems and we continue to see problems with it.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:31.100]   And I just feel like there's just an enormous number of features being added, which is fine.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:36.020]   But I would love to see Apple not release a new operating system other than just incremental
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.140]   upgrades that fix everything for a couple years.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:43.820]   I think that a couple years would be great to solve a lot of these issues.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.060]   I don't need any new features in OS X.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.780]   I think that's the problem.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.860]   I mean, all the stuff they're adding is great.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.420]   I'm really glad that they're doing that.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:58.460]   But what I really need is for my computer to work every time I open it.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.140]   It's interesting, there's been a number of comments on this article.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:07.380]   Here's one from a former Apple engineer.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.580]   Apple changed its software design technology.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:15.060]   So with Bertrand, they would move in giant monolithic releases.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.020]   Sometimes what is the name for this?
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.980]   It's like building a house.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.300]   You put all these pieces in and you hope at the end you get a stable house.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.860]   He said every group would just dump in whatever they had ready and the whole thing would get
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.140]   released with nightly builds.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.060]   He says with Snow Leopard in particular, I remember three dozen releases in a row where
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.820]   Xcode was unusable due to Objective-C garbage collection issues.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.580]   Random stuff you didn't expect, like Core Graphics, would have showstopper issues and
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.820]   then we'd report it and we'd get fixed by next week.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.180]   But this resulted in extremely late releases that had a ton of bugs that we piled patches
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.820]   onto as time went on.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:56.660]   Under Federighi, and this was part of the reorganization Tim Cook did last year, Federighi moved
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.740]   the organization into a sprint system.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.540]   And this is very, in most modern software development I think is now, instead of they
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.180]   call this old style with a water fall system where everything cascades until you have a
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.180]   final product.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.580]   The sprint system, you'd work on new features for two weeks, spend a week fixing bugs and
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.260]   then you do this in sight and you repeat, repeat, repeat.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:22.220]   He said after 10 or 12 or 16 of these cycles we deem it ready and ship it out.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.700]   But he does say the time frame is a lot shorter than it used to be.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.460]   He says, "Tiger and leopard had a good two years to maturing it patches."
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.220]   While the delayed successors missed target dates, they felt stable because they were
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.340]   just old, sort of like Debbie and stable.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.420]   I'm going to channel Renee Richie here who would say right now at this point, well yeah,
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.300]   but let's not forget system seven, system nine.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   I mean, Apple's always had, I mean, software's buggy, Microsoft's having the same problems
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   right now with Windows 8.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.420]   Yeah, and there have been a lot of showstoppers.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.420]   Remember the bug?
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.420]   I forget what was it?
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.580]   8 or 9, no 9.1 or something where under the right circumstances you could lose your entire
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.460]   hard drive and that was on like a shipping consumer release version of the OS.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:12.620]   I mean, Apple has always had certain, has always had wax and wane periods.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:19.700]   I think that the most significant change that I can see is that people are starting to appreciate
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:25.140]   that Apple is just a tech company, that they're not, you know, Zeus did not storm the ground
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.060]   and then fully formed out of his forehead plopped the Apple Cupertino campus and everything
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:37.140]   that they do is wholly incorrect, that they are a company with a lot of moving parts that
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:43.020]   they can sometimes those parts mesh very, very nicely and the machine works perfectly.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.700]   Sometimes they don't mesh well and sometimes things get out of the campus that aren't really
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.060]   fully formed just like pretty much every other tech company.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.580]   If there's a difference over the past five years, it's that there are now so many pieces
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:04.060]   to the company now that maybe five years ago and maybe this was incorrect for me to say,
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:09.180]   but I used to recommend my default recommendation when people would ask me what kind of computer
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   should I buy?
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.380]   What kind of phone should I buy?
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.940]   My default recommendation would be a Mac because I thought that universally this is unless
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.740]   you have a good reason to get a Windows machine, then you're probably going to have a better
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.540]   time with a Mac because it's easier to use.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.780]   It's more reliable in that time.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.740]   However, competitors have created hardware and software that isn't quite as good, but
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.740]   it's good enough that it can be the decision could be influenced by other factors.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:40.660]   And now there are enough problems that tend to pop up with the iOS and Mac OS releases
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.620]   that it's not unreliable, but it's not going to be the same.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.500]   I bet this person's going to have a really good experience if they upgrade right now.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:53.940]   Certainly I've stopped recommending my goalposts for how long should you wait after a major
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.140]   OS release until you actually install it.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:02.140]   It's gone from a couple of weeks to now, a couple of months and to write even today.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:07.100]   I only recently updated my most important Mac to Yosemite and I still have a couple of
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.500]   Macs in the house that I haven't upgraded yet because I don't think that Yosemite features
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.540]   are so important that I need to have it on every single Mac.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:21.260]   And I like the stability of my old computers on 10.8 and 10.9.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.860]   Red sweater software Daniel Jockett, who I really respect used to work at Apple, is a
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:30.220]   really good developer for Apple, has a great blog post at bitsplitting.org where he talks
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:35.820]   about this and he says, "I've indulged these doubts about Apple since shortly after I was
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.180]   hired in 1996."
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.020]   And he does a long litany of problems.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.620]   He said, "I didn't start blogging and earnest in 2005, but here's some highlights to remind
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.340]   you that things have never been fine with Apple.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.300]   And he has year by year key chain in accessibility.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.300]   We need a hero."
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.260]   Which is Apple script implementation all working no play.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.900]   I mean, there are a bunch of blog posts going back year after year after year.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.980]   So it isn't anything new.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:05.320]   And yet I have to say looking at these commentators, even people like John Gruber who have very
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:13.360]   consistently been, Apple cheerleaders are agreeing that Apple might be losing the men
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   in me.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.000]   Gruber says, "Apple squandered a lot of trust with their users.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.520]   It's not that Apple has lost the It Just works crown to a competitor, but rather they've
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.600]   seen it a perception that Apple stuff doesn't work either."
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.240]   And I have to say, It Just Works is not a good motto for Apple at this point.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.480]   Well, and I don't think that, and I look at it, I mean, just like Andy was talking about,
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.960]   I stay away from upgrading.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.280]   And when you have users that are going, "Oh, I don't know if I really want to upgrade
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.520]   that," that's a problem.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.760]   You know, when we're excited, "Oh, those are great features," but whatever features
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.840]   you're putting in are not worth me upgrading.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.280]   We barely upgraded any machines to Mavericks ever.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.840]   You know, like we skip-
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   Go ahead, Don.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   Sorry, Alex.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.160]   I'm going to say, I think this year it's been a double whammy for them because not only
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:02.560]   have they introduced new versions of Yosemite and iOS, but they've got the integration
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   piece as well, which they never had before.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.960]   So they must really be so stretched.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.200]   I know when I was looking at the beta, when the first beaters came out with the extensibility,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.080]   and it didn't really work.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.320]   And I thought, "Well, they've got a few months to get it together, and I'm sure by the time
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.600]   they do release it will work."
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.480]   And come release day, it still didn't work 100 percent, you know, and even now.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.760]   And I was quite at the time I remember thinking to myself, if they don't get this right, there'll
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   be a hell of a hue and cry because people will be very upset about it.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.000]   But it's been released.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.800]   It doesn't quite work as we thought it would, or at least functionally it works as it should,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.760]   but the reliability isn't there all the time.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:45.440]   And I'm quite surprised at the lack of uproar that has been, to be honest, since the release.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:51.040]   That, you know, airplay works between iOS and Mac, you know, 60 percent of the time, perhaps.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.400]   And I sort of keep waiting for them to bring out an update that will fix everything, and
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.640]   I'm still sort of waiting for that.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.680]   I mean, I was badly bitten by iOS 8.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:07.640]   I got the 6 Plus, went on holiday, was it the 801 or the 802 release that actually knocked
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   out cellular.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.360]   And I was without the phone for like a week because that release actually killed my phone
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.440]   for the weekend, while it was on holiday, I couldn't download and restore it.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.720]   So, you know, that was quite a painful process, and it sort of makes you think, "Well, that
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.280]   should never really have happened."
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.960]   Is it time to call for a moratorium on new features?
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.640]   That's what Adam Anks to tidbit says.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.520]   For the time being, OS 10 and iOS are effectively feature complete.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.120]   The one thing we've repeatedly heard from users is a cry for stability.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:39.720]   We'd like to see OS 10, 10.11 and iOS 9 be snow leopard updates that remove craft cleanup
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.240]   problems and polish existing features.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.600]   So we have a stable base going forward.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.240]   Does that seem reasonable at this point?
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   Go ahead, Dan.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.040]   No, well, they did that with Snow Leopard, didn't they?
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.360]   No, that's exactly what they did.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.120]   They had leopard, and then it was quite a surprise at the time because they brought
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.880]   Snow Leopard out and said, "Look, there's a couple of new features, but we're taking
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.520]   the time to actually stabilize things and fix a few things."
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   Take a breath.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   And I'm not sure no one...
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.920]   I remember my briefing on it, and it was 45 minutes, and the entire thing was just, "Here's
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.440]   what we changed to this infrastructure, and here's how we changed this system, and you're
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.640]   not going to see much like that user-facing, but here's everything.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.720]   Here's a little tweak that we did that fixes something, and here's everything we had to
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.040]   do to make that work.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   And I think that...
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.440]   I don't know if Apple should feature lock Mac OS for the time being.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.520]   I do think that maybe it's time to get rid of their Mac OS we have to do.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.020]   We have to have an update out the door every single year, and we have to have things to
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.520]   show off at WWDC.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.200]   I think it might behoove them, too, especially at the scale at which Apple is operating,
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.360]   to move to more of a Google sort of developer keynote thing, or an Adobe thing, where they
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:52.560]   will say, "Here's something that we're working on in our labs, and we're considering the
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.280]   best way to put this into the operating system, or where it makes sense to do it, or if it's
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.640]   just an interesting idea for us to play with on our own.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.920]   And it might take a year or two or three for it to actually show up in a release of Photoshop
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.840]   or Android, but at least they're showing that they're moving the things forward, and also
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:15.000]   they're training people not to think that we're going to show you something in July,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.280]   and we're going to ship it come hell or high water in September."
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:24.040]   Because among other things, I don't know if they're losing any sort of battles with
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.560]   users at this point, but I can't recall a time when Mac and iOS developers have been
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.160]   this dispirited about their relationship with Apple.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.360]   They really are feeling quite beaten up about it.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.960]   And over the past four or five, six months, the number of times I've had conversations
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.360]   with developers who said they don't believe that they're going to continue to be developing
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.240]   for Apple products, and then sometime in the next two to five years, whether they feel
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.840]   as though they're going to be pushed out of the business by limitations that Apple's
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.720]   putting on them, or whether they just simply say that this is, "I've got skills that can
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.320]   be applied to a lot of different places, and it's just not as much fun and interesting
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.080]   to write for iOS and macOS as it was just three or four or five years ago."
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   That's incredibly.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.000]   Even when Apple was doomed, there was a certain, "You know what?
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.320]   We're going to go down with this ship, or continue to play our violins as best we can until
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.400]   the icy waters claim our lives."
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.200]   And now it's like, "Yeah, it's a good ship, and the next port is going to be really interesting,
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.320]   but I think we're good here.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.440]   Let's just get the helicopter.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   Let's just go."
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.440]   Kind of completely tangential.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:37.680]   Did you see that when CNN was formed, when Ted Turner created CNN, that he created a
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   doomsday video?
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.920]   I don't think I saw that.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.600]   The news story, this came from someone who worked at CNN and had access to the entire library.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.240]   And oftentimes they will pre-write stories and put them in the CMS and put them in the
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.320]   documentaries and stuff.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.360]   When Bob Hope dies, here's the package to run.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   There's actually a package that is labeled non-ironically that this is to be played at
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.040]   the end of the world, and you have to get authorization that, yes, the world is actually
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.440]   ending to play it.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.600]   And it's a video of a marine band in a very pastoral place just playing "Nier My God"
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   to the...
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.440]   This is the last thing you would see at standard definition, because that's when this was,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.080]   this package was put together.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.360]   And the slug is HFR, "Hold for Release until the End of the World."
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.840]   And I guess it would be...
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.920]   It's like if you've seen those science fiction movies, the alien race is about...
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.640]   You got three minutes left, you plunk this tape in and you go kiss your wife.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.800]   But now the problem is that...
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.560]   The problem is that while the angels of death with their flaming swords are reaving the
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.800]   souls of the unworthy, let's gather around the TV and...
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.760]   Let's miss some public domain music.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.600]   There's something both funny and kind of chilling that this exists.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.760]   Maybe we'll play this for Apple.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.120]   No, it's not time to give up on Apple.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.240]   Although, if there were credible competition, Apple might be in more trouble.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.000]   I have to admit that I switched from iOS to Android partly because of the kind of...
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   The slow...
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.400]   It's ironic, because on the one hand you want the latest and neatest features, on the other
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.200]   hand you want them to work.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.960]   And I kind of gave up on iOS 8 and went to Android because there was solid competition.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.320]   But I don't think there's any competition in desktop computing.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.760]   No, I'm not going to Windows 8 or 10.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.160]   Well, I think that Apple can make these corrections right now.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   I think that they have the time.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.360]   There's no reason for them.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.560]   I know they have an internal clock, but they're not going to lose market share if they took
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.040]   a year off and just worked on stability.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.040]   I mean, they're not going to...
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   This is the time.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.560]   This is the time to do that.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.760]   I think the thing is, well, with the problems that we're having with iOS 8 extensions and
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:58.960]   the interoperability between devices, it's frustrating, but it's not so bad that it makes
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.320]   you want to throw the machine out the window.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.240]   I mean, I'm fairly happy with Yosemite.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.680]   It's fairly stable for me.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.200]   In fact, I don't think I have any problems with the iOS itself, with everything that I
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   run it.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   It's fine.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.480]   It's just the interoperability that doesn't seem to quite work properly.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   But I just say, "Oh, well, they'll be in you.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.880]   They'll fix it in a release sooner or later."
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:24.360]   It's a frustration more than a really serious problem that I think I have between my devices.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.120]   It should work as advertised.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.840]   It doesn't completely, but hopefully they will fix it.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.520]   But I think it's just a frustration.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:36.160]   To be honest, probably a lot of people don't really understand still that that interoperability
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.160]   exists.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:42.020]   They've got a bit of a pass on it until more people know about it, more normal people
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.020]   and non-seky people.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.440]   It does seem to be if I scan the complaints that it's usually people like Alex who are
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.960]   power users who are pushing the hardware to its limits and developers who have had to
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   struggle with iCloud.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:59.040]   One, I think it's also people who are kind of a princess and a pea.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.200]   It's little things like, "My rotate doesn't work very well."
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.200]   It's a little pea.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   You know what I'm just saying?
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   There are some people that you're...
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.840]   I think my parents don't notice a lot of things that's not working when they're using their
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   iPad or iPad.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.400]   But I think they just think, "Well, that's the way the computer works."
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.220]   So then, really, when I turn this, I really expect it to rotate exactly when I turn it.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:22.220]   There's lots of little weird bugs that seem to be going on in iOS 8.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:27.180]   iOS 8 that I think a lot of them might not be noticing either.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:36.100]   But that's a tip off of a potential problem because if ordinary people are saying, "Oh,
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.820]   well, who cares if a rotate doesn't work immediately?"
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.440]   If there's this big feature in which I'm supposed to be able to share a photo between my desktop
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.260]   and my phone and it just works and it doesn't work 40% of the time, well, that's how computers
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.260]   work.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.260]   We didn't...
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.880]   That used to be a selling point of Apple saying, "Well, yes, that's how computers work, but
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.980]   this is better than a computer.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.900]   This is a Macintosh."
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:02.860]   And so, this is why I come back to the idea of the perception of Apple as a more ordinary
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.180]   company than they might have been perceived as five years ago.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.180]   And on another subject...
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.660]   I'm wondering, maybe that's true that we just thought we expect too much of Apple.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.660]   They are just a company.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:20.380]   Again, I mean, the only thing about all this, there's been a lot of...
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.140]   There are a bunch of different articles.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.940]   Michael Sy has a really good post on his blog that shows nothing but shows excerpts of articles
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.620]   like this that people with Marco's credibility have been writing over the past year, year
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.860]   and a half, pointing out that this is not a brand new thing.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.180]   This is a recurrent thing.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:42.060]   But if we are...
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.420]   The only part of these commentaries that I've been really disagreeing with is saying, "Oh,
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.660]   well, it's Craig Federighi."
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.500]   When Craig Federighi came on or some other person...
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.500]   When this...
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:57.660]   When this other person came on board, when control of the user experience, when Johnny
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:02.180]   Ives group, well, that's when things went south, it's not the result of one person making
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.980]   a change that suddenly upset this perfectly balanced machine.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.260]   Again, this is always a very big complicated machine with a lot of intermashing parts that
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.780]   sometimes are going to work correctly, sometimes they're not going to work correctly.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.220]   And I'm not talking about the parts of the operating system, I'm talking about the parts
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:20.500]   of the institution that create the operating system and that sort of stuff.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.660]   So I said this yesterday on iPad The Day.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.860]   Part of the reason we know these little things now is because the big things have worked
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   so well.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.100]   Remember in the days when computers crashed all the time?
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.100]   Right?
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.100]   Right?
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.140]   The big feature of OS X was that if it crashed, it didn't take all of it.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.140]   Right.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.140]   It would only take down one app and not the entire platform.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.140]   And we were happy.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.140]   We were so thrilled.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.340]   It didn't matter to us that it doesn't have printing features yet.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:49.460]   I remember when you wanted to play marathon, you had to restart your machine with shift
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.740]   down to have all the extensions off so that you know, except for like one so that you
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.740]   can...
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.460]   So I think part of this comes from the fact that computing has become so good and so
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:04.060]   stable that now, you know, the little things make are more irritating because we expect
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.180]   to look at the iPad.
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   I don't think my iPad has ever crashed.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.220]   Programs force closed sometimes.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.100]   But I think that iPad, I probably never...
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.420]   You know, you never reboot your iPad.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.060]   It's rock solid.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.900]   So these little things like slow rotation, yeah, they're annoying.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.860]   But they probably have always said things like that.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.700]   We just didn't notice them because we were blue screening all the time.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.620]   We didn't have rotation with the CRT.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.620]   No rotation.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:34.860]   But listening to your team was really heavy, you know, and like...
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.180]   There's a reason why I started like working with treating myself the ukulele and that's
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.700]   because I made the conscious decision that, gee, I'm spending a lot of time waiting for
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.700]   my machine to reboot after it crashed.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:49.220]   If I had something like knitting needles or like a model kit of an airplane or in a musical
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.340]   instrument that I don't know how to play, just simply pick up and work on during those
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.100]   three and a half minute breaks I'm having every hour, I can actually have a skill at
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.740]   the end of the year.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.940]   And that's no longer really the truth.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.940]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.340]   But there's iOS, OS 10 and frankly, Windows.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.020]   Software is better now than it was.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.860]   And so the little things are more annoying than they were.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:15.500]   And Apple puts itself a square in the bullseye by saying it just works.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.380]   I mean, this has been their credo.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.420]   This has been what their promise has been.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.820]   And I think it's a hard thing to do.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:23.820]   And I think that they would do better.
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.260]   I mean, I just keep on coming back to it.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.460]   I just think they would do better to take some time off and get back to that rather than continuing
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:33.260]   to build on top of this, you know, and just really like take a step back as users to
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   as users already.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.260]   He says I was I was needlessly sensationalistic.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.060]   I'm not saying Apple's doomed by any means.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:44.260]   Well, I think now's the time to take a step back and really and focus.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.020]   Yeah, I think well reading reading has follow up piece.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:52.220]   I think it's very, very familiar because when when I wrote when I wrote those pieces about
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:56.220]   my switching that three part about my switching to Android and when I'm there's another piece
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:01.740]   that is maybe going to get some attention in the next two or three weeks where you really
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:05.940]   have to choose your words extremely carefully.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.860]   You cannot be the slightest bit casual.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:13.740]   And sometimes you have to even be as blunt as to say, I'm specifically not saying this.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:19.380]   I am only saying this because there are people who are out there who just want to see ammunition
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.920]   for we just want more ammunition for whatever argument that they want to make either pro
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.980]   apple or anti apple.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.380]   And if they suddenly say, Oh, well, look at this person who's always loved Apple stuff.
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.100]   And now even he says that Apple sucks.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.380]   No, he's not saying Apple sucks.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.740]   And he's even saying that this complete.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.500]   I'm not saying it's not completely unreliable.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.980]   You see, I've been right all along.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.980]   Shut up.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.380]   You're not saying the things that I said.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.660]   You're saying the things that you want me to website.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.980]   So yeah, I mean, it's that I like that follow up piece from Marco because it was just so
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.540]   familiar in my head.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.260]   And I did take that caution when I wrote those Android pieces, which is why I was able to
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.300]   say, y'all are crazy.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.700]   I can point to every time you every time you're completely even the people who are like Apple
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.700]   fans and say, Oh, here are the fallacies and Andy's arguments.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.060]   I know I didn't say that at all.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.300]   No, that's exactly here.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.860]   I can give you I can cite you the page and the paragraph and the line, which I said,
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.740]   explicitly not that.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.980]   But it's really, really hard when you know that I am there.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.140]   I need to light a match in a room that is filled with dynamite.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:22.060]   And if I like that care, carelessly bad things, I don't intend to happen are going to happen.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:27.860]   Apple is a company is never above criticism or suggestions.
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.260]   We want them to be better.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.300]   No constructive criticism.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.300]   Yeah, I don't use it.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.500]   I don't use it anymore, but I do use it.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.700]   You're using your users and the rest of your friends have created this place of love and
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.700]   safety.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.660]   We're just going to go around the room and talk about how your recent decisions have gotten
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.660]   us all concerned.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.940]   I've written the letter in the letter and I'm just going to read it now.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.100]   We're going to take it to campus.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.100]   There's a van outside that can take it to campus number three with a new management team.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.140]   You're free to board that van or not.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.460]   But for the meantime, I wish that you just simply sit and let those of us who love you
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.020]   talk about this.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:07.420]   Well, and I think it's also probably the days of loving a computer company or worse a consumer
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.940]   electronic company, you're gone.
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.940]   Come on.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:11.940]   It's just, as you said, it's the company.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:15.700]   And it's, it's, people have love for a logo.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.820]   You should not love the logo.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.980]   You should love the things that a piece of technology can do for your life, including
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:25.300]   freeing up more time to spend on things that aren't related to technology.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:31.140]   As I keep modifying the quote that Dave Sim had in an issue of a service, the Yardvark,
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.780]   saying, "Apple doesn't love you.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.100]   Apple only wants your money."
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.100]   Right.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.900]   And they also want to create, I think they genuinely, they're the one company where I'm
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.700]   sure they actually also want to create great products.
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:45.700]   And they also feel as though they have a mandate to improve people's lives by creating great
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.700]   products.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.500]   But in the end, it's like they really just, they're really grateful you're buying their
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   products.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.180]   They're really grateful that you're really likely, you had such a good time with their
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.340]   current product that you might buy their next product, no matter what it is.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:03.020]   But really they, the, the act of love is when they see the money come from you to them.
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.420]   And so please keep that in mind.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   Keep that going.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:06.620]   That's the proper, that's the proper relationship.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.540]   It's like you can, you can pet your dog, you can go play with your dog, but there are
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.820]   things you should not do with your dog because that's not the nature of the relationship
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:14.820]   you have with your dog.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.820]   And I should, I should correct myself.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.980]   I do use iOS because I use, I love my iPad and I still think there's no tablet as good
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.980]   as the iPad.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.980]   That's pretty obvious.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.700]   It's the iPhone I think has been superseded in my heart.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:31.540]   Can I, can I say that maybe this is a good topic for general discussion?
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:36.020]   I, I find myself, I, I, I gave iOS seven a chance.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.860]   I've given iOS eight a chance.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.740]   iOS 7.1 a chance.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.260]   I still just don't like this graphical redesign.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:48.660]   I just can't, can't get any love for it at all.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.900]   And I guess I just got used to it.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:51.900]   I hated it first.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:52.900]   I really did.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.900]   I did it first.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.260]   And you'll see that, that was, that was true with Yosemite where I did, I, I started to,
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.140]   to dislike it a lot less once I put it on my main machine and I started using it every
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   single day.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:06.940]   I came to realize that a lot of my objections were just, it's different as opposed to it's
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:10.180]   poorly designed or you don't like the design.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:15.460]   With iOS though, boy, I, I'm, I'm now sort of at the point where one way or another, I
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:20.820]   have to choose what my next phone is going to be, be it an iPhone six or an X is six,
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.340]   or another Android phone.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:29.820]   And I have to say that my dislike of the read, the, the, the flattened out redesign is a strong
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.740]   point in favor of making my next phone and Android phone.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.340]   I just don't like it at all.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.060]   I've grown to like it.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:42.660]   I think I didn't like it initially, but I quite, I find it quite more, sort of more
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.260]   modern now and I'm quite used to it.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:49.820]   In fact, on the iPad, the, the last remaining app that I've been using, which hasn't had
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:53.860]   the, the makeover was tweetbot and it just got to the point where I couldn't stand looking
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.300]   at tweetbot anymore because it just looks so old.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.860]   It does look old, isn't it?
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:58.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:56:59.860]   And they seem to abandon.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:08.100]   I've gone to the official Twitter client now and given that a try and that fits in with
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.660]   the, you know, the overall aesthetic and I quite, I quite like it.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.300]   That's pretty funny.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:18.460]   But yeah, let's face it, design is a matter of fashion and style.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.740]   It's not, there's no good design.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.220]   I mean, there's wide ties aren't inherently ugly.
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.940]   Burnt orange isn't inherently ugly.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.940]   Where is it?
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.940]   Oh, it is.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.020]   The wide ties.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.980]   It's subjective, but yeah, Burnt orange.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:37.540]   Go to Morgensturr's apartment was a fine, fine piece of a term for design.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:38.540]   Let's take it.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.220]   I think we all deserve a snack right about now.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.220]   This is a hard work.
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.220]   Oh my gosh.
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.140]   So that's why we've got our nature box.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.140]   It's here.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.140]   Right.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.140]   Pineapple rings dried, pineapple.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.140]   You love them too.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.140]   The big island pineapple.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.140]   I have a pineapple.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   You haven't had these?
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.700]   No, I had a lot of them.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.860]   Every time I do, we do a nature box ad I get, you get to choose a snack.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.820]   Oh, okay, okay, I'm gonna try these ones.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.100]   Nature box brings you great tasting snacks right to your door.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.100]   They are more than just great tasting snacks.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.460]   They're much healthier than the average vending machine snack.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.900]   You see on every handful of ingredients.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.620]   Nutricious and fruit, nutritionists improve.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.740]   Yeah, they're not manufactured snacks.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.060]   They're made from, like that.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060]   What's in there?
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.060]   Pineapple.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.060]   That's it.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:20.060]   I was shocked.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.460]   I thought that, okay, clearly they marinated it in something.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.540]   No, it's just pineapple that's been fried.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.860]   They've candied it, no, added sugar?
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   It's just pineapple.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.060]   They perfected the idea that they would serve food as food.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.380]   Yeah, it's a novel idea, but it's a great idea.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.620]   Nature box, it's not just pineapple.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:39.100]   They have hundreds of delicious snacks.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.580]   What have I got here?
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.420]   Whole wheat raspberry, I'm sorry, blueberry figgy bars.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.140]   Love those, the coffee kettle popcorn, the Italian beast repressed.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.660]   So they have sweet, they have savory, they have spicy, toasted, sesame sticks.
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.660]   That's what I'm having.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.060]   The record was the coffee kettle popcorn.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.340]   Lisa Tosecke, come down and grab some of these and try them out.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.780]   And I took that up there.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.660]   It lasted less than three minutes.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   So good.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   There was a bunch of people like, oh, this is good.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:05.780]   Adding coffee to anything makes it better, but kettle corn.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   Oh my god.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.020]   Ticulity tasty.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:12.380]   Grab some orange apple fruit shoes instead of going to that candy machine in the kitchen
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.700]   or the Parmesan garlic pop pops or jalapeno cashews.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:22.460]   Mm, they've got zero artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, zero grams, trans fats, no high
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.300]   fructose corn syrup.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:29.260]   You'll even find snacks with no added sugar, gluten free snacks, vegan snacks.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.900]   You tell them what you want right now for $2.
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.020]   We have a great little nature box sampler.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.020]   That's actually what we're eating now.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:39.180]   This is the five snack sampler for a couple of bucks shipping.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.500]   That's all.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:46.020]   And you get a sense of what how delicious nature box can be.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.020]   So start your trial today.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:54.260]   Get a complimentary sample box at naturebox.com/twit and then sign up for the monthly delivery.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.980]   At home or at work, kids love them, by the way.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.420]   And I just want to point out resealable.
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   So I just opened that.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.060]   That's a resealable bag.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:05.220]   So you don't have to feel like you have to eat all of the pineapple rings.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.220]   Oh, really?
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.220]   Don't do it.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.300]   Actually, these are going to be that way.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.260]   But eating them all remains an option.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.260]   It is always an option.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.260]   Oh, that's so good.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.260]   What is it about?
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.260]   Sesame.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.260]   It's so good.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.260]   It's magical.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.260]   It's a magical seed.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   I'll not show you a lot of sesame.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.260]   In case you're wondering, Andy, these are really good.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.260]   I thought it was--
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.260]   It's so neat.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.260]   I'm not joking.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.140]   That package came and I got to admit that I ate the thing that looked like fig newtons
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   first because they looked like fig newtons.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   That was really good.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:42.060]   And then I-- because I've never particularly had like, oh boy, pineapple.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   That's my taste.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.820]   So I swear to God, I read that label twice.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.220]   Well, they use natural sugar.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.220]   They use natural--
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.220]   No, it's just--
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.220]   It's just delicious.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.220]   They just didn't screw it up.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.220]   It's delicious.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.220]   I love that ingredients drive by it.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.020]   Apple should take that same lesson of these, of these, of these, of these, of these, of
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.020]   the pineapple rings.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.220]   Just to keep it simple and don't screw it up, you'll make people very happy.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.220]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.220]   Make yourself happy.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.220]   Make your mouth happy.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.220]   Mmm.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:18.300]   All right, you're ready for another quadcopter tour of the Apple campus in 4K video.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.300]   Mmm.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.860]   This is the January update.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.860]   Here I go to-- let me see.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.660]   Should we go to 4K?
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.100]   I don't know what it's going to look like.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.660]   I mean, this isn't a 4K screen in--
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.660]   Give it a shot.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:34.060]   People at home are watching it in 720p anyway, but all right, I'll look on the clarity in
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.060]   that--
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.980]   Oh my God, it actually does look pretty good.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   Here we go.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.580]   The-- what are you looking at?
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.580]   Get rid of that.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.580]   There you go.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.580]   Here we go.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.540]   This is the Circle campus, the Infinity campus.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540]   It's well underway.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.660]   What you can do when you got $10 billion has been done on it.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.660]   Nice.
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.660]   Nice.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.660]   No bugs here.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.660]   There's going to be a parking garage underneath.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.060]   I'm-- you know, the landscaping will make this look beautiful, of course.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.500]   I love the music.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.860]   It's kind of James Bondy.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.860]   Dad, I'm going to--
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.860]   You're looking for it.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.860]   You know, when I worked at Skawak Ranch, you know, almost all the--
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.860]   You've been there, right?
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.260]   Yeah, almost all the parking is all under the building.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.260]   Yeah, smart.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.060]   That's-- but that's a Sylvan environment.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.860]   You're like kind of in the woods.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.260]   And so are we looking back to one infinite loop?
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.460]   Is that what we're seeing?
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.660]   Or is he just showing off now with a squat copy?
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.260]   It is a little smoggy in Santa's day.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:36.380]   I'm going to tell you, look at that for a K. Super crisp.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.700]   There's another article somewhere about how they agreed to preserve a historic barn that
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.700]   was on the HP campus.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.700]   Yeah, can you believe that?
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.700]   Crazy.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.820]   According to the article, they took it apart board by board, numbered every board, numbered
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:54.860]   every fastener, are rebuilding it near one of the athletic fields on the new campus so
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.740]   that will now be a working tool shed.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:02.620]   With pride saying for the first time in years it will be a working barn once again, holding
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.620]   the fertilizer, the manganese.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   Howl, okay.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.620]   I'll just back the occasionally sleep there and--
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620]   Get ready done.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.620]   Get ready done.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.340]   How old is that historic barn?
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.140]   It's like 80 years old.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.140]   Ooh.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.140]   Well, I think I'm 40 years old.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.140]   In America, you know.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.140]   We don't have anything.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.140]   We're late bloomers.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   Old.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.940]   What would historic be in Liverpool?
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.620]   Entire housing estates are older than that.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.620]   Yeah, I know.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.460]   And they're definitely not historic.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.820]   Yeah, well, I went past my brothers.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.020]   My brothers just moved and went past a house and had 17, 19 up on the door.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.020]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.020]   So, yeah.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.020]   It's the stuff.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.020]   Someone's getting on a little.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.620]   You guys park your cars on top of the final resting places of 600-year-old kings.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.620]   So you're--
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.620]   Oh, you're a little old hat.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.020]   Do we dig up King Richard III or just go, you know, we got--
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.260]   Yeah, he's in a car park.
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.260]   We don't--
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.700]   We got plenty of kings and plenty of churches.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.220]   We can deal with this.
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.220]   So there it is.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.660]   That's the-- I think we're still a couple of years off.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.140]   And we're going to get invited for a tour.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.500]   I want to-- that's what-- I'll tell you.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   Well, if I have--
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.500]   Well, if I have the answers, then--
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.060]   Yeah, that's where they're going to have all the events from now.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:12.940]   If I have any sadness about being kind of somehow off the list--
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.500]   I'm not going to use the B-word band-word, but somehow off the list is that I won't get
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.020]   to visit this.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.540]   Thank you, me-y-th-z-z.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.420]   Or whatever that is for doing this.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.900]   You can visit the campus.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.500]   Just, you know, visit thrift stores until you acquire an entire domino's uniform.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.300]   Fit a pizza box with a ray of GoPro cameras.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.300]   Candygram--
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.460]   --a special-- a special-- especially how you shaved your head.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.460]   Because--
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.460]   --pits a gram-- --because you're suited for locks or--
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.460]   They won't recognize you.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.300]   You know, I feel really bad.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.580]   I realized that I had to update my passport because it's going to expire and I'm going
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.580]   on a trip in June.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.420]   --and so I have to get it now.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   Oh.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.860]   Because I'm going on a trip in a few months.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.980]   And, you know, they-- takes a few months to do this.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.980]   You don't have to do it in a few months.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:59.380]   You can do it in a couple days.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.820]   You can for a lot of money.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.420]   And I thought, well, I have the application already.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:08.500]   And then I went in to get my picture and I realized, oh, my God, I have no hair.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.540]   So my passport picture is going to look like this.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.140]   You think I'll be able to get--
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.460]   Don, you have experience getting into the US.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.060]   I'm sure you'll be fine.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.020]   I'm sure you'll be fine.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:21.820]   I don't know.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.300]   They're going to look--
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.500]   It's going to be a conversation point.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.780]   I'm just going to go like this.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.340]   See the part below my hair that looks normal, right?
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.260]   That looks like me.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.700]   You would think they would know enough to say, well, you were--
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.660]   You might get-- all you have to do is if they--
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.300]   By they, I mean, the United States--
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.700]   Because they give you a hard time saying--
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.220]   --all you have to do is just look at them and say, hey, I survived.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.140]   Yeah, that's-- you know what?
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.260]   And then I give one of those shameful--
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.260]   We could--
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.020]   It's shameful, but I was just going to say chemo.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.940]   I shouldn't do that.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.660]   I wouldn't say that.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.900]   I would just say, hey, I survived.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.340]   And then don't do that.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.500]   I don't know if I'd even--
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.340]   That's like-- that's a quinoa hora.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.820]   That might be the sort of thing where--
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.500]   I don't know who portions karma and--
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.020]   Right.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:00.900]   --peddle a little bit.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.740]   But that's the sort of thing that's sort of--
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.300]   it's like lint in the--
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.140]   Well, whatever--
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.100]   --recurrent feeder hose in your dryer.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.220]   You don't have to clean it out every single time,
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.860]   but if that builds up and suddenly you've got a fire.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.900]   I do have permission, drew all enough.
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.580]   And by the way, we love you, Drew.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.380]   Great guy.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.060]   His cancer has recurred.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.020]   But he was the guy who did the Blame Drew's cancer
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.300]   campaign on Twitter.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.900]   And I asked him, can I say--
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.300]   can I tell the security officials Blame Drew's cancer?
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.100]   He said, you can.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.860]   So I have permission.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.300]   If somebody else has cancer, I just--
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300]   I'll just say I lost a bet.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.380]   That's probably a better one.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.700]   You say it's for the kids.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.220]   I don't want to go in the long thing
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.820]   where we raise money for you and--
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.620]   OK, what if he just go with headlights?
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.140]   My kids got hit by this.
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.580]   It was the only way to be sure.
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.540]   That will get that--
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.060]   People--
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.460]   --sympathy and it's as a lie.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.500]   That's not the sort of thing that will make anybody upset.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.020]   I'll tell the truth.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.140]   Or you could say, I was sleeping.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.220]   My kids shaved an edge and I had a unit out.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:54.900]   Oh, how about this?
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.580]   Chewing gum.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.820]   Chewing gum.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:06:59.460]   Wax.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.620]   Wax.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.460]   People do decide to have the hair like that
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.300]   as a fashion statement.
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:03.820]   I know.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:04.660]   It's probably-- it's no big deal.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.460]   But the problem is in June, I will have hair--
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.620]   God willing, had hair again.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.780]   June's not going to be the problem.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.220]   It's going to be next June.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.260]   This June, it'll be pretty--
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.100]   Then you know the past year is 10 years, LS.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.500]   I think you can go get another picture taken.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.940]   And you can have it updated on the past.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:21.460]   You can have it updated on the past.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.180]   I don't know why I digress.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:23.780]   I digress.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.860]   I have a digression problem.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.260]   But also, we have a news problem because--
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.380]   All right, anything in CES you guys want to talk about?
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.860]   I mean, we really-- it's not a lot of--
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.100]   we've done most of the Apple news.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.620]   I mean, I could mention this ridiculous class action lawsuit.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.620]   OK, yeah.
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.300]   My only thing about the class action lawsuit,
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.260]   we're talking, of course, about the fact that--
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:47.380]   They're suing over the fact that IOS 8 takes about a quarter
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.500]   of the storage on an iPhone.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:55.220]   And so when you-- the Apple is getting sued,
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.540]   like if you buy any technology product,
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540]   there isn't stuff on the thing.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.740]   Anyway, I mean, look at a surface.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.460]   Didn't Apple also go through something like this
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.380]   a number of years ago by saying, oh, your 15-inch laptop
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.740]   is actually 14.8 inches of diagonal.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.300]   That's like--
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.020]   I bought a house and there's all these walls
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.260]   taking up the space.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.980]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:21.620]   The plaintiff says Apple is using sharp business tactics.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:22.460]   Sharp?
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.060]   Sharp.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.020]   I hope--
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.540]   I just--
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.260]   Yeah, that's one tech company you want to emulate.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.020]   Sharp.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:27.780]   Using these--
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.460]   They're basically the technique of--
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:34.420]   I need to do this in the Martin Short sweaty lawyer voice.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.620]   Using these sharp business tactics,
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.940]   defendant Apple gives less storage capacity than advertised
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.660]   only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment,
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.220]   e.g., when a consumer is trying to record
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.260]   to take photos at a child or grandchild's recital,
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.660]   basketball game, or wedding.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.860]   What?
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.580]   I guess the implication is they don't give you enough storage,
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.580]   but they say, oh, but you could buy some iCloud storage,
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.900]   but only when you really need it.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:07.260]   It's Cuneo, Gilbert, and Laduka, Washington DC based law firm.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.540]   That's who makes money on these things, by the way.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:13.900]   I have been the recipient of many a class action award.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.300]   Got one for Popchips.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.420]   For how much?
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.100]   Ten cents.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:18.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.380]   It's like you get a free bag of Popchips.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.340]   Many millions.
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:23.460]   Because Popchips got sued, class action sued,
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.260]   because they said it was, I don't know, a healthy natural snack.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.820]   And so they sued.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:28.700]   It's potato chips.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.420]   Come on, everybody knows what potato chips are.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.500]   And they lost.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.580]   And so we each got a free bag of chips.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.340]   Big deal.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.260]   And one of the lawyers get probably $50 million.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.020]   So this is another one of those, I'm sure.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.460]   We feel there are substantial-- this
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:48.620]   is what the Cuneo, Gilbert, and Laduka says.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.540]   We feel there are a substantial number of Apple consumers
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:54.860]   that have been shortchanged and will be pursuing claims vigorously.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.860]   Now, I do have to admit, the 16 gig iPhone,
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.220]   they shouldn't even sell that.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.260]   And that's the one side of that, is that the relationship
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.500]   started at 32.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.420]   But I think the really, the answer to this
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.820]   is simply putting on the box.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.460]   And they probably should do this.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:18.100]   16 gigs and what is it of free?
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.500]   If they just said, not all 16 gigs is taken up
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.700]   by the operating system, not all--
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.340]   16 gigs, 12 gigs free.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.460]   Oh, but then they're promising 12 gigs free,
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:28.140]   which they can't do.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.780]   But if they want to simply remind people
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.460]   that this is the amount of storage and not all storage
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.060]   is available to the user in any given time,
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:35.940]   that's good enough.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.660]   Asterix.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.620]   That's all they need is an asterix.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.580]   This is going to be the same reason why now you
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:43.860]   can't have a funny commercial without saying,
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:46.340]   please do not try to hop a public stick onto the surface
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:50.140]   of the sun or any hot surface, because you will burn and die.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.780]   But it's not just Apple Low, is it?
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.780]   Which is strange.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   Every phone that you get comes with an operating system.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.620]   Every electronic system.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:02.220]   More than half of the 8 gig Samsung Galaxy S4 was taken up by us.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.180]   Apple is so much better than other makers.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:07.300]   As a matter of fact, Motorola even makes a point of saying
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:12.940]   that here's how much fewer bloat apps we have on our platform
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.660]   than any other maker outside of Apple.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.500]   And yeah, I mean, it's sad.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.300]   Here's some good news.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:25.620]   Apple is now selling Sim-free, unlocked iPhone 6s and 6
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.980]   plus is in the Apple Store, online and retail.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.780]   Now, what is that?
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.540]   So if you went and got a--
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.900]   you had to get some carrier, right?
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.780]   So you get T-Mobile, but that's unlocked.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.460]   There is a T-Mobile Sim in there, but you take it out.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.780]   So I'm not sure what we've gained.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.300]   I don't understand what's different about it.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.940]   Other than you just say, I don't want to do it.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.580]   No, none of the above.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.700]   You can just say, I don't want to--
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.020]   This is-- they do this every year.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.780]   So when we went and got it and we got in line in September
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.620]   to get the iPhone 6, you had to get one of the four major US
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.060]   carriers.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:02.740]   It wasn't an option.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.540]   I got T-Mobile.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.300]   You got T-Mobile.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.020]   We just took the Sim out and put whatever you wanted in.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.300]   I mean, they've always had those in the UK since--
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.660]   I think they have to.
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.460]   Yeah, well, since the iPhone launched, I think it's always
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.580]   been-- I've always bought a Sim-free version
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.540]   and just keep popping the same Sim and staying
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.220]   with the same carrier.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.820]   You use the T-Mobile?
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:22.860]   Me?
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.380]   For my iPhone?
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.700]   Actually, my iPhone's over-rising.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.860]   The only time I'm excited about--
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.140]   I'm sorry, but the only time I'm excited about having T-Mobile
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:30.980]   is when I'm overseas.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.060]   I got the international plan.
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.540]   And it's like, you have free data in Turkey.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.700]   I'm like, this is amazing.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.860]   And then I come home and I'm like, I can't get any restriction.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.540]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.620]   T-Mobile and Petaluma.
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.780]   It's good.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.220]   I was getting 20 megs down, 15 megs up in T-Mobile.
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.420]   Because no one else is using it.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:47.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.860]   But you get into the city or DC or--
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.060]   But there are a lot of places you go.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:50.820]   Yeah, if you're--
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.900]   Almost everywhere I try.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.900]   I don't know where it's really good, other than Petaluma.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.140]   I have T-Mobile.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.900]   I'm just getting ready to get rid of it.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.260]   I think they're all bad.
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.180]   Run and have it.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.540]   It was good here for a while.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.020]   And now it's gotten really slow.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:03.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.340]   Because they're all bad.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:05.940]   So there you go.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.820]   If you want a unsubsidized unlocked iPhone without any
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.260]   sim in it, you can now get it at Apple.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.500]   So I'll make you jealous.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.820]   My particular deal is great.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.460]   I use a company called 3.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.540]   And they have a thing called Feel It Home.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.620]   And basically, they've got--
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.980]   I think it's either 12 or 14 different countries they've
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:27.220]   got arrangements with, whereby you take your phone
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.700]   to that country and it just works as though you're at home.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:32.180]   So I can now come across to the US.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.260]   And there is no extra charges.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.900]   It's just basically the same deal.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.540]   No, but T-Mobile--
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.220]   But T-Mobile, you get 2G.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.060]   That's the problem.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.660]   He's getting full 4G.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.140]   I think I got at least 3G in--
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:42.660]   No.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.580]   No, I know the plan.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.660]   It's 2G.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.140]   You may feel like you were getting 3G.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.100]   It was really good.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.940]   They do give you T-Mobile, gives you unlimited data.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.380]   But at 2G speeds in Europe, unless you arrange for better.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.380]   Yeah, I got-- I was in--
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.100]   But I like 3G.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:56.940]   You know--
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.620]   It's stable, I promise.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.540]   Didn't though, they stopped selling the unlimited data plan
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.180]   card.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.380]   You should be able to go to the UK, get a sim for 3.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.940]   And it was unlimited data for like 30 pounds.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.460]   Oh, right.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:07.820]   You're right.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:08.940]   I'm not sure if they still do that.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.060]   Yeah, I think they stopped that one.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.460]   Somebody told me they did it.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.300]   Because that was the one I was telling everybody to get.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.580]   They suddenly realized that once Leo started talking about,
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.620]   they stopped making money.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.860]   It's probably my fault.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.540]   They go, those deals came over here.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.780]   They started actually using it.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.820]   You got the Leo deal?
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.820]   Nope.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:27.260]   So Volkswagen's going to get CarPlay and Android Auto.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.460]   I think this is good.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:31.220]   I'd hate to buy a car that I could only use an iPhone with.
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:32.500]   Even if I were using an iPhone, I'd
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.260]   like to know that I could--
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.580]   five years from now use something else.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.940]   CarPlay and Android Auto and Volkswagen's.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.500]   This year--
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.100]   This last year you kept a car for more than five years.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:42.580]   Oh, no, no.
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:43.740]   My Lexus--
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.540]   All right, you have Lexus.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.420]   Lexus is a 2001 Lexus.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:46.940]   OK.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.260]   And it's got a--
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.580]   I just have 50,000 miles on it.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.540]   Abbey drives it now.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.660]   OK.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.340]   Abbey drives it now.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.100]   I did replace it.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.660]   But the Mustang we still have, that's five years old.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.980]   I'm not that kind of guy.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.620]   X-Shyam, now that I lease cars.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:02.140]   Yeah, too.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.620]   Every month I have a car.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.700]   I'm like Steve Jobs.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.060]   I don't want a license plate.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.660]   I don't want a license plate.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.780]   CarPlay-- no, I am joking.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.020]   Although I should mention, I think
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.220]   we're going to sell the Mustang.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:19.580]   And it has the Twit.tv license plate on it.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.180]   I don't want it.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.820]   Lisa says, I'm not doing it.
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.260]   Should we sell the Mustang to a Twit fan,
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.340]   including the Twit.tv license plate?
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.860]   I think that would be pretty--
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.700]   I'm not donating it to a charity, though.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.540]   I want it.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.860]   I want the money.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.180]   Hey, you spent a lot of good money on that.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:37.700]   Here's a picture of--
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:42.820]   from The Verge at CES of--
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.260]   is this Apple CarPlay running?
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.460]   I can't even tell.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.060]   How do you--
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:48.620]   That looks like Android.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.100]   I see glimpse.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.540]   Looks like Android, yeah.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.940]   But it looks like a--
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.780]   yeah, see, that's an HTC One--
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.500]   Oh, I get it.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:55.980]   I get it.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.860]   So there's the phone.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.100]   And here's the car version of the phone.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.420]   Let's see if they've got another picture.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.060]   Nope.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.620]   So Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:10.420]   both available on the Volkswagen MIB2 dash electronics.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.540]   They'll come to the US in 2015.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:16.380]   It also supports MirrorLink, which is a Sony technology.
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.420]   Why not?
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.780]   Basically, all you're doing is configuring the display
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.380]   to show the display of the mobile device, right?
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:31.580]   Parrot is going to offer aftermarket in-dash systems
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.180]   that can take any car and give it--
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.420]   I need that for my car.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.220]   My car's too old.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.180]   You need a big hole in the front.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.260]   I'm ready to take a little saw out there and--
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.460]   Get rid of the German engineering--
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.180]   The RMB6.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.220]   Oh, it has a dash cam in it, too.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.580]   Not sure what you're going to do with that.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.900]   A dash cam?
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.900]   In the built-in to the parrot.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.740]   So you can look down and rec wire.
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:02.500]   So people can see you scream while you're bowling.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.100]   Oh, forward.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:03.540]   There it is.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.340]   You see, there it is.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.060]   There's the dash cam.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:08.300]   So you'd mount that underneath the mirror.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.420]   Nav, hands-free telephone operation, voice controls,
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:15.380]   onboard diagnostics, and a dash cam
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.900]   should fit into any relatively recent car.
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.740]   And CarPlay Android Auto is included.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:23.740]   There's CarPlay.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.260]   No price or availability yet.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.580]   This is another CES thing.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.740]   Where you get your hopes up, you get all excited.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.260]   When people start announcing stuff, I'm like, OK, you
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.620]   had to have thought about the price.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.860]   I know that you want people just to think about the features,
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.700]   but let's move on.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.700]   I really don't care.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.780]   They probably don't have a distribution deal yet.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.500]   So it's going to depend on who they partner with.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.740]   Yeah, I feel like that's what one of the problems with CES.
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.100]   You go to these events.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:54.820]   First of all, you can tell this is at one of the showstoppers
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:59.780]   or pet-- one of those mini events, which means a parrot
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:04.940]   spent a minimum of $15,000 to be in a hotel wall.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.300]   And showstoppers?
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.220]   I think it's a little--
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.820]   Oh, no, it's 10 to 15, I think.
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.860]   I think it's more.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:13.620]   And to get in this little ballroom with only 150 other people
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.900]   or however many.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.100]   And the press go there because they get free food.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.260]   And then now, every company knows these companies
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:24.940]   will be over covered because it comes before CES opens.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.260]   Nobody's got anything to do.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.900]   They're having roast beef.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.020]   There's a chocolate fountain.
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.620]   They're in a good mood.
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.740]   And so they're going to take a picture of anything and get you
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.540]   from wondering the roast beef is actually quite good.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.220]   It's very good.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:37.180]   It's very good.
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:38.100]   I have a--
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:38.780]   Free protein.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.660]   Yeah, I feel like this stuff gets way over covered only
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.900]   because it's easy.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.860]   This is like the laziest kind of journalism.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.100]   It's like, although I'm just a fire presence there.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.380]   So you're not there to not cover things.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.860]   Like I said, I'm more on the verge of these other sites.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.980]   They're like, we're here so that every time someone refreshes
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.580]   the page, they're reading about something more--
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.660]   Yeah, they have that obligation.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.100]   That's a really hungry machine.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.300]   Scooter-- hey, hey.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.140]   ScooterXner in chatroom says, "Pepcom," which was last night
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.180]   is 9 to 12,000.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.860]   So I overstated the cost a little.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.020]   But that perspective--
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.980]   But look, I mean, here's this big gizmodo--
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.180]   10 to 10, you know.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.620]   A booth in actual CES where you're
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.940]   going to get a lot less foot traffic from one
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.540]   that are actually going to write about you
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:23.180]   is three or four times that.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.380]   So it's actually a really good deal.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.940]   No, I'm not blaming the companies at all.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.340]   Of course, they're going to do this.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.540]   That's like I said, this is strategically brilliant.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.780]   You pay $9,000 or $10,000.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.260]   I have a lot of-- they say I would do a conference.
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.780]   If I did a conference, I would want them all
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.380]   to be like 10 by 10 booths.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:40.420]   You know, just keep everybody kind of on a semi-even keel
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.980]   and let people actually go through it
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.900]   and not have it be these, you know, the circus that--
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:45.700]   No one--
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:50.020]   If Apple will allow this, and we knew what would happen,
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.620]   company named TapSense has announced a platform
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:57.660]   to bring contextual advertising to your Apple Watch.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.180]   Oh, sharejoy.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.060]   Woo-hoo.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.500]   I don't know if that's--
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.020]   Actually, Apple may not have a choice on this, right?
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.500]   The only thing I'd say about it is that all of this stuff
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.180]   is inherent-- I mean, it's not necessarily inherently bad.
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.020]   It's just that what happens a lot of times
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:17.420]   is that the people who are giving out those coupons,
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:19.540]   you know, really aren't thinking about making it
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.940]   a great experience for the user.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.260]   I mean, they're trying to-- how much do we have to give up?
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:27.660]   You know, I used to do a mailing list in the early '90s
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.900]   with actual postcards for sales that I built this huge mailing
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:34.100]   list for when I was working for Sony.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.660]   And I was the only one that had this list,
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.660]   and I could, you know, had an old database and everything else
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.700]   that I built in Hypercard.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:44.220]   And the-- but I could, you know, put it all together.
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.940]   People loved getting those postcards
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.780]   because they were great deals.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.220]   I pushed it really hard.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:51.660]   You know, you have to be 30% off, and it has to be this,
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.980]   or, you know, it has to be a whole bunch of things,
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.300]   and people loved getting them.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.300]   I think a lot of times when we get these stupid ads, you know--
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.980]   Well, there's another thing going on.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.940]   I have a lot more space in my mailbox
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.420]   than on my desktop for postcards and junk mail
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.220]   than I do on a postage stamp-sized wristwatch.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.300]   And if you take over the entire face of the watch
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:11.020]   with an ad, you are not going to win a fan from--
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.980]   I'm not going to be a fan of that.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:14.980]   Don't you think that's a little rude?
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:16.540]   But what if I'm walking to Starbucks?
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.940]   I get in front of Starbucks and says, hey,
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.060]   you can have a free coffee.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.060]   I'll be like, oh, that's fine.
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.060]   I just want to know what time it is.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.540]   No one had on my wristwatch?
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.780]   Did you have a free eggnog latte?
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:30.260]   So far, I don't think I've ever seen an ad on Android Wear.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.620]   I think it'd be perturbed if I did.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.540]   I think it'd be nice to switch it on and try it,
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.180]   but then have the option to opt out.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.180]   Right.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:41.700]   If it does get too intrusive, just switch it off or even be
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.300]   able to put certain filters on.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.940]   Because as Alex says, there are certain ads that
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.620]   can be quite useful, and especially if the location
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.980]   are where as well.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:50.860]   It might be interesting.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:51.540]   It might be useful.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.580]   But as long as they give us the option to opt out.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:57.100]   Dr. Mom and chat room says, generally, people who
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.140]   spade $2,000 on a wristwatch aren't really
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.060]   worried about saving a nickel at Starbucks.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:01.860]   You'd be surprised.
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.700]   That is not true.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   That's not true.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.820]   Cheapest sons of guns I've ever met are rich people.
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:10.260]   Now, do you think they got rich?
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.900]   Every nickel and a jet.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.380]   You were not--
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.580]   Definitely not rich, but my wife made me take the car back
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.940]   and put gas and we rented a car.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.820]   And I was like, I am not going back.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.300]   It's two gallons.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:24.180]   I'll just pay the fine.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:24.900]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.660]   I had to go back.
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.340]   And I was worried you $10 a gallon.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.580]   No, I paid $7 a gallon.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.820]   And they calculate--
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.700]   The delta was $8.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:35.460]   I was like, OK, that's just complaining.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.820]   Anyway, but the point is, is that that's why I tell you right
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:40.460]   now I stopped bending over to pick up anything less
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.300]   than a quarter.
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.580]   I've done the calculations.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.940]   It's not worth it.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:45.460]   But here's the thing.
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.980]   It's a country boy.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.300]   I will pull a quarter out of horse manure
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.740]   before I pick up a quarter in San Francisco.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.820]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.780]   Oh, yuck.
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.100]   It's gross.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:00.380]   San Francisco, if you ever live there,
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.700]   you see what goes on in the streets.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.140]   I have seen what goes on.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:04.460]   I'm not going to pick up that quarter.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.180]   My son always reaches down to pick up one quarter.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.780]   Why do you think they call it Liverpool?
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.940]   I just want to say--
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.220]   no, I'm sorry, not done.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.380]   We actually fad out before the show
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.460]   that they call it Liverpool because there's a bird.
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:19.100]   The liver bird.
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.340]   The liver bird is a cormorant.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:25.380]   And so that's the shield that the motto of the system.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.380]   Oh, all right.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.980]   So it's a liven pool.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:32.860]   Well, we call it Liverpool, but it's the liven bird.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.860]   So I don't know how that works.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:38.380]   Because originally, in years gone by, it was liven pool?
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.020]   It could have been all sorts of things.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.060]   I mean, the accents and the dialects have changed.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.620]   Considered recently.
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.860]   And there was a pool.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.980]   I mean, we're a port and there was a pool of water,
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:49.180]   so it's probably two of that.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.620]   A pool of water once.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.180]   Nobody can fill it in with and don't pick up a quarter
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.460]   if it's in a pool of water.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.980]   That's all I can say.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:58.860]   Or a tuppence or whatever it is you guys use.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.180]   That's been a while.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.020]   Tuppence.
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:02.940]   Don't worry, pop it.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.460]   I love tuppence.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.140]   You guys don't have tuppences anymore?
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.060]   Two peas.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:09.620]   Do you have shillings?
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:10.180]   No.
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.940]   Oh, man.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:13.620]   You had the best money in the world.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.900]   And you probably have dollars and cents now, right?
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:17.620]   No, no, no.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.900]   They're still pound shillings and pens.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.580]   But no, no, no, we haven't.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.260]   No, that's what we say pound shillings and pens.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.180]   But we don't actually have shillings.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:23.740]   There are no shillings.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.380]   Just pounds and pens.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.100]   Five peas.
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.620]   Five peas, 10 peas.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.580]   Well, tuppence was two peas.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.980]   It was two peas.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.020]   But you don't have a tuppence coin.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.900]   We don't call it tuppence anymore.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:35.860]   We don't feed many birds.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:40.660]   So can I ask if I came and I said, hey, Governor, you got a quid?
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:41.180]   Would you--
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:41.900]   Oh, be all right.
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.100]   You know, quid is still a word.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.500]   Yeah, but quid was never-- that's not actual currency.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.820]   That's slang for a pound.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.780]   It's a pound.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:49.260]   Quid, yeah.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.380]   Right.
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:53.220]   While we're on the subject, now, are your chimney sweets
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.100]   very dancy and singing or do the job?
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.380]   It isn't really good luck to touch them.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.900]   There's very few around, actually.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.140]   I remember we did catch chimney sweeping once when I was a kid.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.820]   But that was the only time I've ever seen a chimney sweep.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.380]   So that was quite a while ago.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.380]   But yeah.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:09.340]   I'm sure you're actually--
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.940]   Your action is rather realistic.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:11.940]   I've been listening.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.380]   So how do we get here?
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.380]   That's the question.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:18.380]   Sorry.
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:20.140]   We're done.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.380]   Oh, Tom McAllister.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.940]   Screencast's online.
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.420]   It is a great place to go.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.420]   If you want to learn how to use--
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.020]   you've expanded beyond the Macintosh, haven't you?
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:29.780]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.740]   For quite a while now.
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:34.020]   I do two shows a week now, Mac Show and also
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.580]   iOS Show as well.
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:38.060]   But no Windows show.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.140]   No Windows show now.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.020]   I've been asked to do them, but it's not the same sort
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.460]   of community, I don't think.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.500]   I'm not sure what not people would be--
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.860]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.900]   It's a different sort of vibe.
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.540]   Even today, I think that is one of the real assets
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:58.180]   is not OS X or iOS 8 or the hardware.
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.220]   It's the people.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.460]   There's something about Mac users.
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:03.980]   You know?
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:04.460]   I'm pretty--
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.660]   There's a crazy ones.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.460]   People are enthusiastic to learn more about how
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.180]   to make the most of it, which is--
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.660]   Am I the only one that doesn't--
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.100]   it feels like you're going to walk up to someone
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.260]   with a Mac at an airport and start talking to them?
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.460]   It's like totally.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.700]   But you have your iPhone open or something.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.700]   And you start chatting.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:22.660]   And you get airport working because I can't get any
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.860]   base stations ever since I upgraded.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.860]   Yep.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.980]   Did you read that article from two days ago?
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.620]   And we all have.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.260]   Where's the misfits?
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:32.780]   Right.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:35.060]   With the rebels.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.780]   No, see, there's a time when we have
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:41.780]   to acknowledge that every single TV star on TV
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.300]   is using an Apple product that we see them--
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.220]   No, no, no.
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:46.620]   Andy, we're the minority.
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:49.420]   We're a tiny little sliver of rebels.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.620]   We're like those pathetic people in politics who own
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.420]   like 80% of all the power.
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:56.500]   And the minute you try to say, hey,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.220]   how about you make the Christmas tree 70 feet instead of eighth?
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.500]   And oh my god, we're being attacked.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:02.780]   Our rights are our rights.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:04.420]   We're a believer people.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.380]   We're not positive.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.100]   We just don't want to acknowledge that the company that we
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:11.100]   give money to is one of the most successful tech companies
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.020]   in the entire world.
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:15.580]   We have no respect to the status quo.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.820]   Keep your hey, penny, top ends, and quid.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.540]   Put a painting stone in every single box that they ship.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:22.340]   They could do that for two years,
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.500]   and they can still last for 10 years after that.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.860]   You can quote us disagree with us, glorify us or vilify us,
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.900]   but you can't ignore us.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:31.260]   Don't call us successful.
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.500]   We hate that.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.180]   And we like to listen to alternative rock like Taylor Swift.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.340]   And you too.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.340]   And you too.
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:39.820]   I love you too.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.940]   Someday, you guys, you're going to discover you too,
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:44.460]   and it's going to change your life.
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.300]   Young band right out of Ireland.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.460]   I think you're going to hear that.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.860]   We're old enough that we can still remember when it was alternative.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.340]   They were hip.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.580]   Many, many, many, many months ago.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.140]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.340]   Your picks, my friends.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:03.140]   Coming up, Don McAllister, Alex Lindsay, Mr. Andrew and Nastko.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.740]   Renee, as we mentioned, is stuck poor guy at CES,
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.100]   where there are no Apple Prime.
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.300]   Although, wait a minute.
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.620]   There's a ton of Apple accessories.
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.300]   It's like iPod accessory, iPhone accessory.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.820]   You know, hell there.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.180]   I mean, there's the whole pavilion devoted to that.
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.060]   There's a whole section.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:19.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.420]   In the North Hall, usually.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:21.660]   Huge.
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.780]   Huge.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.340]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.420]   If you are one of the crazy ones, one of the artists, one
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.620]   of the creators, one of the special people who
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:34.060]   have your own business and you know what I'm talking about,
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.140]   the worst time of the month, the end of the month,
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:38.660]   when you have to do those invoices.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:40.900]   I hate invoicing so much.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:44.500]   I had to fire up Microsoft Word or Excel or something,
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.940]   print them out and put them in an envelope, get stamps, mail them.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:52.900]   I would put it off for months and not get paid as a result for months.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:53.740]   Not anymore.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.580]   I found FreshBooks.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:57.060]   Actually, in 2004, I was working in Toronto.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.740]   Amber told me about them.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.940]   Great company that just started up.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:03.980]   The easiest way to create professional looking invoices,
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:05.460]   in minutes, you email them.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.380]   They can mail them.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.540]   But you know what?
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:10.300]   Your clients actually like the email,
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.740]   because there's a big pay me button in there.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:15.860]   And that FreshBooks will let them pay with their credit cards
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.420]   or a variety of online payment solutions.
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.620]   Makes it very easy.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:24.500]   That's one of the reasons FreshBooks users get paid an average of five days faster.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.740]   And if you do have one of those late pays,
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.020]   you don't have the embarrassing phone call or email.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:34.020]   FreshBooks automatic reminders will help you get paid faster and stay worry free.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:38.260]   Plus, they've got great mobile apps that let you track time and hours,
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:42.220]   let you take photos of receipts so you can keep your expenses in one place,
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:45.060]   instantly access complete financial reports.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.780]   I love FreshBooks.
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.980]   And it connects, by the way, if you're using a Mac,
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:54.100]   with the third party app ChronoMate.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:57.300]   So you can use ChronoMate on your Mac to simultaneously track time
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:01.660]   across multiple projects or log business expenses, right, from your menu bar.
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:03.380]   ChronoMate, you should take it out.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:07.500]   And of course, they have a great iPhone app.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.740]   And with an open API, others are developing more and more for the FreshBooks platform.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.300]   Great help from real people.
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:17.700]   Amber MacArthur, I got a quote from her.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.420]   She's the one who introduced me to FreshBooks.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:22.820]   She says, "FreshBooks Mobile allows me to quickly send invoices
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:26.860]   and check in on my business no matter where I am."
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.060]   Try FreshBooks free for 30 days with no obligation.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.420]   Go to 30 days free.
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.820]   Go to freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.620]   Use Macbreak weekly.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.060]   Actually, there's no offer code.
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:41.220]   But I think, though, they will ask you, "Where did you hear about us?"
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:44.260]   And you could say Amber or Leo, but I would say Macbreak weekly.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.020]   And then these guys will get credit, too.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.220]   Macbreakweekly, freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:52.380]   And use Macbreak weekly when they ask you, "How did you hear about us?"
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.900]   For 30 days free!
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:57.180]   Such a revelation when I found FreshBooks.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.860]   And you can build, by the way, an alternate occurrence is like Tuppence,
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:00.780]   hey, Penny?
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.060]   Really?
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.660]   Do it all.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:05.220]   Is there a hey, Penny?
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:05.780]   No.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:09.220]   That would be worthless.
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:11.220]   Yeah, I don't think we even have the half.
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.340]   No, there's no half-fronts now.
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.940]   Penny is like nothing.
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:14.900]   How about the groats?
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.100]   Do you still have the groats?
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:17.140]   The groats.
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.580]   That's a scotchish.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:19.300]   The scotchish thing.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.140]   The groat is like an oak cluster.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:24.020]   I only know about that because of Blackadder.
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.460]   All right.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.860]   I will give you this groat.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.620]   It's changed more.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.500]   How about crowns?
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.580]   Do you have crowns anymore?
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:38.340]   No, they used to be actual coins, but they did go into slang,
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.460]   I think, half a crown.
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.180]   What is a crown?
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.380]   Is that-- that's more than a pound, right?
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:42.420]   Is it a guinea?
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.620]   What the hell is a guinea?
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.500]   A guinea is-- used to be a one pound and a shilling,
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.380]   I think, a guinea.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:47.780]   What?
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:49.700]   Why do you have a-- what?
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:53.780]   You have a designation for a pound and a shilling?
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:55.380]   It's a guinea?
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:55.940]   See, I don't--
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.060]   In my lifetime, anyway.
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:00.660]   Well, I know, but I'm stuck in Oliver Twist land here.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.700]   And you read Sherlock Holmes, here's a guinea.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.460]   And then they get-- oh, the guy gets all except.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.460]   What's a farthing?
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.420]   A farthing.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.100]   That was-- no.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.140]   Gonna buy a phone.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:11.780]   That was--
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:13.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.620]   That could be a fine--
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:16.580]   That might even have been a--
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.100]   That might have even been a quilish of a penny.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:18.980]   It might have been some really big--
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:20.020]   A farthing.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:20.340]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:21.780]   Is there-- is there like a cartoon
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.620]   thought balloon above Don Sand that says,
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.860]   oh, my God, Americans are all idiots.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.780]   It's so stupid.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:28.580]   Why is he asking?
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:29.780]   They're so stupid.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.820]   We have politics.
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:31.620]   We have culture.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.180]   We have--
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:32.660]   Oh, they weren't--
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:33.700]   But it's getting farthing.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.660]   The next is going to ask us what we call elevators.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:38.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:40.580]   What do they call shoes over there?
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:41.780]   Do they call them shoes?
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.340]   Do they call them something else?
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:48.740]   Santa Claus, does he leave candy in the shoe by the fireplace?
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.340]   Is that how that works?
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:51.380]   All right, I'm sorry, Don.
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:53.140]   I hate to do this to you.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.780]   A farthing is a quarter of a penny.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.980]   Possibly.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:57.380]   I'm not--
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:58.420]   It's with the chat room tells me.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.220]   People are anyway.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:32:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:00.220]   There you go.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.020]   I'm going to go to Ryan.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.180]   Quarter of a penny.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.140]   So you got a hay penny and a farthing.
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.660]   That's-- OK, that tells you how old these novels I'm reading
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.100]   are because that's considered worth something.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:17.900]   And why use the letter D to symbol a penny?
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:19.540]   You're looking at me like-- I know.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.060]   I know.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:20.580]   I know.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   I know.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:21.580]   I know.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   I know.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   I'm just having fun with that.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.580]   I love Don.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.580]   We don't even understand what--
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:31.300]   our great-- we went to China together, had so much fun going down.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.580]   Remember that in--
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.020]   Where was that?
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:36.980]   The river that we went down?
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:38.060]   Oh, Guilis.
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:38.620]   Was it Guilis?
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:39.620]   violin, yeah.
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.460]   Yeah, with the rafting and--
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.980]   Yeah, and the guys with the cormorants
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.620]   that would do the fishing.
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.700]   Maybe those would live us.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:47.540]   They'd do the fishing.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:50.060]   They'd swallow the fish, but they've got the next tide.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.700]   So the fish don't go all the way down.
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.660]   This is the way this is.
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:54.660]   We saw this.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.780]   There's a raft in the river, and we're going by.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.780]   And it's not for tourists.
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:58.780]   They still do this.
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:33:59.780]   And the guys got a basket.
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:00.780]   He's on a raft.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:03.900]   He's got these birds, and he's got a big, long stick.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:04.900]   And the birds go out.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.620]   They catch fish.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:09.820]   And they try to swallow them, but they won't go down, because their necks are wired.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.420]   The guy takes the stick, grabs the bird, brings it back, makes him--
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:17.820]   just shakes his head till the fish comes out in the basket, and then puts him back in
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.980]   the water, and the stupid bird does it again, and again and again and again.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:21.980]   This is how they fish.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.980]   Fish.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.980]   That's what I call putting some birds to work.
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:28.980]   Remember that, Tom?
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   Everyone's doing happy about that.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.980]   We'll have the birds.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:33.980]   Well, I take the whys often and feed them all.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:38.980]   At the end, they get a little fish at the end.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:42.980]   No, but they've been doing it for probably millennia that way.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:43.980]   That's right.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:45.980]   And they have the little rapids that were on the raft.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:46.980]   Yeah, it was so fun.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:47.980]   The little waterfalls.
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:50.980]   Oh, man, was that fun.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:54.980]   I will never forget Henry, my son, who was there with us.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.980]   That's right.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   As you well remember.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.980]   Yeah, attracting all the young girls.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.980]   So when we were in Beijing, the girls come in from the countryside, so they're kind of
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:09.980]   wide-eyed as we were in the big city, and they see Henry, who is tall, good-looking, and
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.980]   blonde, very athletic, and they all started posing with him for pictures.
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:14.980]   Exotic foreigner.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:16.980]   It's an American.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:17.980]   They all do this.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.980]   It's the piece I'm very excited to be the exotic foreigner.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:23.980]   Then they asked him, "How much is a farthing in your land?"
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:24.980]   [laughter]
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.900]   Andy Enoco, your pick of the week.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.980]   My pick is one of my favorite apps in the entire world.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:32.980]   It's by India.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.980]   It's called I Draw.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.980]   And it's available for both the Mac and the iPad.
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:41.980]   Over the past couple of weeks, I've been having to do some design stuff.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:47.860]   And what I love about I Draw is that it's like having Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:51.620]   or any of these things only it doesn't assume you spent the past year and a half of your
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.220]   life learning how to use Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:57.500]   It is a vector illustration graphics program.
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.140]   But if you want to do things that are just simple, I want to bang out a sign that to put
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:05.780]   on my door for Christmas visitors.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:09.060]   Or I just want to design like a mock-up of a book cover.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:14.700]   Or I want to--I'm doing a presentation that I need to create an illustration of a simple
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:19.860]   idea, you can knock these things out in about five minutes and I draw where Photoshop would
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:23.540]  --or excuse me, we're Illustrator would be saying, "Now, what kind of paper stock will
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.180]   you be printing this on?
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:27.980]   And are you going to be using me on my K or are you going to use RGB?"
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:28.980]   What do you know?
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.180]   It's like, I just want to draw a car with a horse inside it.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:35.220]   And that's all I need right now.
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.220]   This is really cool.
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:41.500]   And one of the signature things about it is that like I've never ever gotten the hang
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:42.500]   of Bezier curves.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.380]   And I've been using Illustrator since 1.0.
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:49.500]   I still just don't instinctively grab the handle at the right place to make the curve
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.980]   go where I want to go.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:55.340]   And I draw, you simply draw the line that you want to happen.
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:59.300]   And then it will simply just simply connect the dots in a very reliable fashion.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:03.900]   And then you just simply move the--whatever control points result in a non-Bezier way
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:07.260]   that you simply match that to whatever you want it to be.
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:12.020]   And I know Illustrator also has a draw line and it'll sort of--it'll trace that line too.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.700]   But it's never as simple as it is in Eyedraw.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:20.940]   Like I said, it really is all the--it'll get you 97% of the way that you would get if
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.220]   you did it with Illustrator.
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.820]   But with Illustrator, it's for professional graphic artists who can book--who can build
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.100]   three days on an illustration.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:33.860]   Eyedraw is for people who just want to create an illustration or again, or assign, or label,
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:34.860]   or anything.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.420]   And they don't want to spend $500 to get it.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.060]   They don't want to spend three days.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.820]   And they just want this thing to be done.
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.900]   It's $25 for the desktop version.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:49.700]   It's $9 for the iOS version, complete file compatibility.
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.700]   It supports layers.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:51.700]   It supports everything.
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:57.140]   And it's, like I said, it's almost a no-brainer amount of money to spend to have this thing
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:01.420]   on your MacBook that will just solve most of the graphic problems you might have.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:05.580]   This is funny because this is one of the earliest programs on the Mac was Mac Draw.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.620]   Yeah, and I was--boy, I was such a ninja with Mac Draw.
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:10.620]   I mean, I was also--
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.140]   It was also a vector, right?
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.500]   It was also a vector.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.940]   And that's the thing that I like about it, because I thought that Mac Draw had this beautiful
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:21.220]   thing where just draw like a jagged outline of the shape you want and then tell it to
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.580]   smooth that out.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.260]   And then you can just modify it as you did to get it exactly the way you want it, where
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:29.420]   as Bezier was like, "No, start your control point.
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.420]   No, whole option.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.380]   No, no, no, you pull too far.
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:33.380]   You pull up.
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.540]   Now you've looped the thing.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:35.540]   I'll delete that control point.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.540]   I know.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.540]   Every time.
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:38.540]   Exactly.
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:43.460]   I thought if I just like vaguely tell you what I want, you show me what you think I said
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:46.420]   and then you let me change it to what I really meant.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.940]   That's easiest pie.
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:49.940]   It's--
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:51.740]   Mac Draw was fun to draw.
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:54.980]   And again, I used to prefer the use group meetings, the Boston Pierce Society.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.860]   It used to make like big, big posters.
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:58.940]   I used to do t-shirt designs in Mac Draw.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.540]   And we're not talking about like jagged like little squares and rounded rectangles.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:04.260]   We're talking about, "Oh, wow, this beautiful illustration.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.340]   You must be an expert."
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.580]   I'm an expert, but not other things that the experts use, unfortunately.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.620]   Mr. Dom McAllister, Screencast Online.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:14.820]   What do you got for us today?
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:15.820]   Right.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:16.820]   I've got two quick ones.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:20.420]   First one is a piece of software called, and I'm sure we've mentioned it before, but
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:21.420]   Switch Rezex.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:23.100]   It's a great application.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.580]   I use it pretty much every day because I'm constantly changing my monitor resolutions
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.140]   to do various screencasts and things.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:35.700]   It's a great utility that allows you to switch your monitor into any of its supported resolutions
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.060]   very quickly or create custom resolutions.
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:44.820]   This is especially useful now as people are getting more and more H the high DPI monitors.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:48.620]   You can actually go into Switch Rezex and you'll get a whole host of 20 or 30 different
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:51.260]   resolutions that your monitor will support so you can create your own custom ones as
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.260]   well.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:56.020]   The reason I mention this as well is that I recently got a 4K monitor and the Mac Pro,
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.540]   it wasn't fully supported.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.980]   The developer actually went onto the forum.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.420]   There was quite a few of us complaining that we couldn't get the proper resolutions.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.020]   The guy actually spent a day creating a special configuration file that enabled the monitor
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.700]   to work, but the thing is he did it independently.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.860]   He didn't need Switch Rezex to use it, which I thought was a really nice gesture.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   Wow, that's so.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.580]   So just a bit of karma back to him.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:19.900]   That's when I found this too is when I got the 4K display and I wanted to see what dot
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:22.500]   for dot would look like and the Apple doesn't let you do that.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.740]   When you see it, it's like, I guess I won't be using that.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:30.380]   Well, I've been using it for years because I record in standard resolution.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:31.380]   Oh, you need to.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:36.820]   I'm going to do it by 720 or currently doing 1080p ones now and some of the monitors originally
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.820]   didn't support that.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:42.300]   So I had to use an application like Switch Rezex to flip the monitor into those resolutions.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:43.300]   It's free, right?
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.100]   No, no, I think it's about 14 euros.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:47.100]   Sure.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.100]   Yeah, 14 euros.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.100]   Yeah, cool.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.100]   So that's that one.
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.220]   And the other one is a little piece of hardware.
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.220]   I've been using it.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:58.380]   I don't really like to take my laptop traveling until I get the 12 inch, you know, the retina
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.060]   back, okay, when that comes up.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:01.940]   But anyway, I take my iPad.
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:08.460]   And I've been using the standard SD card connector kit to connect my SD card to the iPad and
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:11.500]   back up my photos to the iPad, which is fine.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:15.820]   The problem is though, if you use the iCloud photo library, next time you sync, all those
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:19.140]   photos will be synchronized with your iCloud photo library, which is not really what I
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.460]   want because, you know, I've got like 4K videos and stuff on there that I don't really want
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:24.460]   to sync.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:31.900]   So what I've got is this little device here, which is the My Passport wireless hard disk
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:35.460]   which actually has an SD card slot.
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:40.140]   So basically, you know, on the field, you've got two terabyte drive, you pop your SD card
[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:44.620]   in and it backs it up to the hard drive, either automatically or using the buttons on the
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:48.620]   top or via a client that you can get on your iPhone or iPad.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:52.860]   And it's just an easy way of saving your SD information.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:57.140]   So if you've got a GoPro or DSLR and you want to back it up, you can just do it straight
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.460]   to the drive.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.460]   Perfect.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.460]   Yeah, it's smashing.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:01.460]   I love that.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:02.460]   It's a very well.
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:03.700]   And it's wireless as well.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:08.340]   So if you want to set your movies with you, you can stream your movies from the hard drive
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:10.340]   as well and you can back up anything to it.
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:11.340]   It works really well.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:12.860]   It's got a USB 3 connector on the end.
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:16.180]   You can plug it to your Mac when you get back and it's just treated as a normal drive
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.180]   then.
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:20.020]   You know what I really want to get?
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:26.020]   Alex is one of those Atomos, what are they called, recorded the hard quarters.
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:37.540]   The Shogun because my Sony a7S will record, I think 4224K out of the camera, but it won't
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.220]   record it in the camera.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:41.460]   So you have to attach a thing.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:45.260]   I suppose yours would do that, Don.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:50.260]   No, I got the Panasonic GH4 which would cost 4K.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.900]   I guess I would say we're bordering on too close to an AB.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:55.900]   Oh, let's wait.
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:56.900]   We're on the second half of the year.
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:59.660]   I think we actually are thinking of going to the AAB again.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:01.500]   That was fun for us and it isn't over covered.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.540]   I'm like CES which is over covered.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:04.540]   I'm going this year.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:05.540]   Are you doing?
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.540]   I'm going.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.540]   Yep.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:08.540]   Awesome.
[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:11.540]   The new media Expo is working in conjunction with MAB now.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.540]   It's actually embedded within an AAB.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.540]   So new media Expo.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.540]   It should be.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:20.220]   Yeah, yeah, it's a big deal for them because it's the National Association of Broadcasters
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:24.500]   and now the podcasting community is, you know, podcast conferences now in with an AB
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:26.540]   which has it should be.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.540]   Is that March?
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:28.540]   It's in April.
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:29.540]   April.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.300]   We'll have to plan for that.
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:34.500]   Miss, thank you very much for your picks, Don.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.140]   And for being here.
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140]   Anytime.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.140]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.140]   You're going to the week.
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.140]   I brought it.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:41.140]   No, no, no.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:42.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:43.380]   So the first one is I've been.
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:44.380]   So I just did this whole thing with my kids.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:48.020]   My kids have two of my old iPads and I sync them all.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:50.980]   So I've been so I'm a little into the educational stuff because I had to make sure both had
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:54.540]   the same thing for their flight and exactly the same pages so they didn't get lost.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:44:01.540]   So another one that I added last week I talked a little bit about light bot which is incredible.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:04.380]   Watching my even my daughter play it is pretty cool.
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:06.340]   There's five.
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:07.340]   But I'm still playing it.
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:08.340]   Oh my gosh.
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:09.340]   I love it.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:13.140]   There are some really like my son said I can't figure this one out and he handed to me and
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:14.140]   took me a little while.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:19.260]   I mean it was you had to not only do a subroutine but you had to do it very efficiently like
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.500]   it doesn't let you just program.
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:22.500]   That's good.
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.500]   You know lazy programming.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.620]   So another one that I got into that I got for my kids that I'm enjoying too is called
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620]   Playground.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.620]   Have you seen Playground?
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   No.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:35.860]   So Playground lets you build bridges and so you have these little bridges here and you
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:40.660]   can build them and then it runs a little truck across them.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:45.580]   And so you see if you're trying to do it within a certain budget over a different terrain
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.780]   and you have to you know it's kind of a virtual city playground.
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.700]   Yeah well bridge constructor but it's a little bit more cool.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.660]   Bridge constructor I bet you this is the same.
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:57.820]   It might be the same company and they do other ones because this is build a city of your
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:44:58.820]   dreams.
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.820]   Let's see.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:00.820]   It's bridge constructor huh?
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:04.580]   Yeah this one's called it's called Playground.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.020]   It's made by Clockstone.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.540]   I think Clockstone.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:11.900]   But I still search for it.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:13.940]   See if we can.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.260]   Of course let's see.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.260]   No.
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:17.260]   No.
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:23.860]   Don't you love the search on the app store?
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.180]   You may be able to search for bridge constructor as well.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:28.540]   We don't have it over the shoulder for you.
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.300]   That's the only reason I wanted to.
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:32.140]   Yeah I don't think it's.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:35.180]   Anyway but it's a yep.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.180]   There it is.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.420]   I head up games is that it?
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:39.620]   Yeah that is it.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.620]   That's it.
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:41.620]   I can like I can.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.620]   Okay there you go.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:46.260]   So you can see here you can build all these little suspension bridges and everything else.
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:51.940]   And it's just again if you're looking for stuff that I just enjoy playing it.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:56.260]   But my kids will sit there and spend hours trying to figure this thing out.
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.540]   I phone or iPad 2.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.820]   And they get again it starts easy.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.820]   And then gets.
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:02.620]   I like stuff that starts easy.
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.900]   And then it gets complex.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:06.860]   And you can get you can win it.
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.900]   But then you find out you spent too much money on it and you can keep on going back.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:11.740]   And so you're trying to become more efficient.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:16.020]   And you're just like trying to go back and get three stars on angry birds.
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:18.540]   It takes a little while to get it working.
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:23.020]   So anyway it's a it's cool little game and it's great for kids and adults.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:26.660]   Here's a fun thing that the app store search does.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.460]   I search for bridge constructor playground.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.460]   It says not found.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.700]   Maybe you mean bridge constructors playground.
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:34.180]   I click that.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:38.740]   It says no don't have that either.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:40.500]   You mean bridge constructors playground?
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:41.500]   Yeah yeah maybe that's it.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.500]   I'll click that.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:43.500]   Let's see maybe they have that.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.500]   No no no no.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:50.260]   I just was I was just messing with you says iTunes just screwing around.
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:53.500]   Now my other my other pick was actually crowd sourced.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:57.020]   So this was like I went up on Twitter and said you know looking for some other things
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:59.940]   looking for some new new things to add to a mix.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:03.820]   This is called mixilar mixler and this is M.I.X.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:11.140]   L R dot com and what they do is they let you stream live audio and I have been really
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:12.860]   finding trying to find the right thing.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:14.700]   We use nice cast for a long time.
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   Yeah I've used that.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:19.700]   That was really to your computer but this is really this is a service that will let you
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:24.300]   embed it and I think that we've just really looked for I've really been looking for the
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:27.220]   right one for this because there's a lot of conversations you don't you know a lot of
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:33.180]   times we do you know we're doing video casting you know using hangouts or something like that
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:36.620]   because we want to record the audio and broadcast it but what people really want to do is just
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.500]   listen to it on your website.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:46.820]   And so so anyway I so they do the back end they do the back end from what I you know from
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:50.220]   what I literally just just started pulling this down I just want people to take a look
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:51.220]   at it.
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:56.780]   I want to thank DRC online who is the one who and you can record and then you'll have
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:59.540]   a podcast to put it on sack ladder drop box.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:00.540]   Yep.
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.540]   Mix cloud.
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.100]   I think that it's a it's a cool little one to do live.
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:09.060]   You know I think that there's a lot of things that don't necessarily need to be video streamed
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:12.140]   and I think that I haven't really found a great solution for this and so this is definitely
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:16.260]   one that will be testing and again DRC online I posted it on my Twitter feed and I thought
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.060]   I'd let everybody know.
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:19.620]   There's also Spreaker.
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.620]   Spreaker?
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:21.620]   You're with Spreaker?
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:22.620]   I'm not so much from that.
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:29.340]   That's the greatest name but the idea is similar which is that you can create your own live
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:35.100]   thing and it also makes a podcast out of it which it'll store on sack cloud.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:39.740]   I've used Spreaker a little bit just playing with it but this looks good too.
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.540]   I want to try both of these.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:46.940]   Because I'm figuring someday I'll retire I won't have the beautiful studio all the staff
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.780]   it'll just be me and a boy in his computer.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:53.620]   Well yeah and I think that I think that sometimes you look at this and there's a lot
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:58.780]   of times when I don't want a video cast that I would have audio than an audio cast.
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.940]   I'm not willing to turn it on sometimes.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:05.980]   Exactly and this will work from mobile and from your computer.
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:09.660]   So I'm going to channel Renee Richie when we had our host dinner and that was a lot
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.940]   of fun although the worst food ever Andy did not miss a thing.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:14.940]   Except for the good conversation.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:15.940]   The conversation was fabulous.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:18.100]   I'm glad I opted for the cash equivalent.
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.100]   Which is about 350.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:23.660]   A couple of tuppets is in a farthing.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.380]   That's a Marie calendar frozen chicken pot pie.
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:27.380]   That's tasty.
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:29.580]   Yeah we would have been better off at Marie calendar.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:34.300]   We thought oh it'll be fun we'll go to the wash show house which is like Petaluma Landmark.
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.940]   It used to be the old stagecoach stop in the 1850s and we thought oh this will be really
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:44.820]   fun but apparently the mashed peas and carrots were from the 1850s.
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:47.020]   But don't worry we're going to save them and use them again next year.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.100]   It was just horrible.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:55.740]   However it was so great and I put some pictures up on Flickr to see in person all these hosts
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:50:00.900]   and Renee Richie was there and one of the things he showed me while he was there and
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:04.420]   so this would be his pick if you were here is Crossy Roads.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.980]   Have you guys played Crossy Roads?
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:06.980]   Yep.
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:09.020]   It's Frogger meets Minecraft.
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:13.900]   It's like an 8-bit Frogger so it's not so hard.
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.820]   It's like Frogger meets a cupboard.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:17.820]   You're hopping.
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.820]   Oh look how fast.
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:19.820]   Oh whoa.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:20.820]   I got squished by the cab.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:23.940]   It's the idea is you're just crossing the road basically.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:24.940]   It's free.
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:28.900]   There are in-apps purchases which are mostly just characters so I don't know.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.620]   I think you could just play free for a long time.
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:38.460]   The idea is to collect coins and it's just like Frogger, Cuber, kind of all of the same.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.780]   Oh god.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:41.820]   Oh whoa whoa.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.820]   It's surprising.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:44.380]   It's also got a little flappy bird in there.
[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.380]   Right right right.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:46.380]   Right.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.380]   And then you get a free gift.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.700]   The free gift is a let's see is it coins?
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.700]   I got some coins.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:57.220]   I like the free gifts because then I don't want a notification.
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:04.340]   Now I can win a prize, spend those coins, pull the lever and get a new character.
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:05.340]   Give me the horse.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:06.340]   Give me the horse.
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.340]   Give me the horse.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:08.340]   Give me the horse.
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.340]   Poopy Pigeon.
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:14.900]   Okay so now I'll be hopping with that pigeon.
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:18.580]   This is a very addictive and a lot of Frogger.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.580]   It's Frogger.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:20.580]   8-bit Frogger.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:23.580]   It's exactly the same game isn't it?
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:26.980]   It's like if making sounds.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:29.780]   I'm getting rid of him.
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:34.620]   Exactly what the future would have been envisioned like in like 1983 where they could
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:39.380]   they couldn't envision like a game like like a Assassin's Creed but they could imagine
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:41.740]   how about Frogger only it's in 3D.
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.940]   Yeah exactly.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.620]   Now I've killed my poopy pigeon which I don't really mind.
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:48.180]   So I'm going to go with the horse.
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:50.140]   The winged horse.
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:51.140]   It is.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:52.140]   It's exactly.
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:53.140]   See how 3D that is?
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:54.780]   Whoa I don't know what's going on here.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.780]   What a button.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.780]   Stuff's coming out of it.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:57.780]   Oh he's snazzy.
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:58.780]   It's a dragon.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.780]   It's a dragon.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:00.780]   Fire breathing dragon.
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:01.780]   Can I run across?
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:03.420]   Whoa whoa whoa let's get that coin now.
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:06.340]   Hey I'm doing good.
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.340]   Don't distract me here.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:10.060]   I know we're trying to do a show but I'm doing.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:11.060]   Ohh.

[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:15.460]   That's how they get you.
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:16.460]   You got used to it.
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:18.180]   See how cool that was?
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:19.180]   Wouldn't you like to breathe?
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.180]   Oh la la la.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:21.180]   Crossy roads.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.900]   It's free but it's a little addictive.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:24.900]   I should warn you.

[01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:59.220]   You work so hard at this and I'm really glad it's going well for you.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.220]   That's so great.
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.220]   Yeah that's good.

[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:15.900]   And knock on wood people still seem to like it.
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.340]   Isn't that nice?
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.340]   Definitely knock on wood.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.740]   Yeah yeah yeah no it is good.

[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:22.740]   Still working hard.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:23.740]   Still working too hard.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:24.740]   It's hard work.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:26.460]   It is but it's enjoyable.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:28.580]   And you're working for yourself as well.
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:29.580]   Right.
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:30.580]   Isn't that nice?
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.580]   Alex Lintz.
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:35.540]   And I always say it sort of supports my gadget addiction as well.
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:36.540]   Well that's the thing.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.660]   That's exactly why I got into this.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:46.620]   In 1978 or '79 because I want it was so expensive to buy floppy disk drives that I said
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:49.940]   I'm going to have to write to support my habit.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.420]   And they never stopped.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:52.420]   That's how I got into music.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:55.020]   Yeah I worked at Radio Station just so I get to see it.
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:56.020]   So you're wrecking cocaine?
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:58.020]   Hey man.
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:00.020]   Where's the cocaine part?
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:01.020]   Oh come on.
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.020]   Come on.
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:03.980]   You were a music director.
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:06.020]   You know the album would come and be open it up.
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:07.740]   And oh look there's something in here.
[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:08.740]   What did you spill some?
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:09.740]   Oh.
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:10.740]   Mine usually came with whiskey.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:14.740]   That's why I left the music industry because I was pickling my liver.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:15.740]   And limit candy.
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:18.300]   Alex Lindsey what do you have to plug?
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.980]   Just follow me on Twitter.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.260]   Alex Lindsey is all one word.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:26.180]   That's usually the best place to find me.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.820]   And we've got some fun stuff.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:33.220]   I think we're threatening now to do a twin I think we're not going to bring back.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.220]   This week in media was great.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.380]   Is Daisy going to do it again?
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.380]   No I'm going to do it.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.380]   You're going to do it.
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.380]   Yep.
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:39.380]   So the...
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.380]   We love this week in media.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.740]   Yeah so I think that we're going to bring it back in.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:46.140]   So follow me and I'll let you know when we're going to build it around interactive kind
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:47.740]   of question and answer type of thing.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:49.420]   So it should be fun.
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:50.980]   I love it.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:53.460]   Mr. Andy Inako he's at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:56.100]   An ink-stained wretch.
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:58.100]   But he's still one of us.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:03.420]   Traditional analog classical hand tooled artisanal journalistic processes.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:06.300]   He believes in slow journalism.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:08.260]   The old fashion kind.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:11.700]   Stuff that I write if you're replacing the linoleum in your kitchen you can use
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.740]   underneath the linoleum.
[01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:14.740]   Try to do that with iPads.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:18.340]   You'll end up with a very crunchy and expensive floor.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.980]   Great to have you all three of you.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:20.980]   Thank you so much for being here.
