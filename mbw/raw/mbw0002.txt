[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Hey everybody, this is Alex Lindsey and this is Mac Break Weekly episode 2.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Hi everyone, this is Alex and we've got a great crew.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   This is our episode 2 and we're really excited. We've been really having a great time with the first episode.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   We went really really well and we're excited to keep this going. We hope everybody's enjoying it.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   We've got a great crew here today from New York. We have Scott Brooke. Hey Scott.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Hey guys, I'm psyched to be here.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Scott is at a large broadcasting network and you also probably hear him on this weekend media.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Scott joins us frequently and sometimes if we're lucky, it gives us a little legal insight.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We won't say why, right Scott?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Yeah, it relates to my previous occupation which I like to hide as much as possible because I wasn't an attorney for several years.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yeah, so we try to keep that fact just among friends and not, well I guess that's out the window.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Yeah, it's out the window. Also coming in from Seattle we've got Scott Born.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   So this is going to be hard. I'm going to have to keep track of the Scott's here. Hey Scott.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Hi Alex, I am psyched to be here and just say Scott is one of the two of us to answer.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Yeah, exactly. Now Scott, Scott Born is also one of the hosts for iLifeZone which is a great podcast.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I get to show up every once in a while too. We've got another and also just as a background for those of you in the history of things.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Scott was the founder of NetRadio which is in my opinion kind of the father of all of the stuff that we're doing now.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   In other words I'm old. No, that's not what I meant.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Anyway it was really the forerunner of a lot of the stuff that we're doing now.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Also from iLifeZone as well as Macworld is we have Chris Breen. Hey Chris.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Hey, where are we talking to you from Chris?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I'm just south of Santa Cruz, California.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Are you near Capitola?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I am. It's really nice down here.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Are you in Capitola?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   No, just a little farther south than Aptos.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Oh, an Aptos. I know that I've actually been on the Aptos beach.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah, it's a very nice beach. We try not to tell people about it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So no, there's no beach here, no water. Just a lot of sludge and garbage stuff so stay away.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah, as soon as they see it they won't believe you anymore. But that's okay.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Are they doing the big sand castle thing in Capitola on Labor Day?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yeah, it's a constant thing. We have the BagoÃ±a Festival down here.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's just nothing but fun.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah, it really is. Summer kicks in.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That whole area is just awesome. Anyway, so, and we also have Daniel, is that right?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Daniel, Aaron.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Aaron. Yes.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Hey, Daniel. And Daniel is from RoughlyDrafted.com. Is that correct?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yep.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And we asked Daniel to come on. Leo and I both, Leo actually ran across
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Daniel's website and just, there's just a lot of really, really great information there.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So we thought we'd bring him on to add to the expertise.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So thanks for joining us, Dan. Daniel. Thanks for your time.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And we've got, at first, after WWDC, I started wondering whether we were going to have enough content.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And, you know, because that's usually the big news thing, but a lot of stuff is built up.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So we've got quite a few things to cover. The first one, and I don't really know, you know, what's going to happen here
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   or whether it's really that important. But I find this whole thing about Apple facing Nasdaq delisting.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   At least interesting. So, I guess the upshot here is that Apple is late in sending in the reports.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So they have to send in their financial reports. They're late primarily because of the, I believe the option issue is kind of what most people are pointing to.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And Nasdaq is now told Apple that they're going to, that they face delisting because they are tardy.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And so now Apple's dealing with this. It just seems interesting to have this huge company, our huge company,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   being, you know, facing delisting in Nasdaq. So what's going on?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I'm going to throw this one to Scott Brook in New York first to kind of give us an upshot of what's actually happening here.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, I think it's just important to put in context. I mean, this is actually, there's a, I think there's kind of trend right now where people are taking a close look at the option grants and what impact it's had in terms of reporting of income for a lot of companies.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I mean, there's been over 100 companies that are kind of falling into this fold right now.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And the real issue is it's an old, at this point now it's an old accounting issue.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   It used to be that you did not have to claim granted options as an expense against your income if a couple of things happen.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   One, you looked at the option on the grant date and it had a value that, or grant price that was at least equal to fair market value.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And it could not be lower. And the theory was that if it was the fair market value, the day that you got it, you as the person gained the grant would work harder to see the stock price go up.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And therefore, you and the shareholders would all benefit.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   What's happening is, and that rule has changed, that now it's like all grants options need to be expensed.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But under this old rule, what happened is that basically you had a group of people that there's one company in particular, Converse, who really was egregious, that what they were doing is that the date of grants to certain shareholders were insiders, they were back-dating them to a point in time where the value of the shares was lower
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   than the current fair market value. So what that basically did is it put the options in this term called "in the money", which basically give you an example.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Say the current fair market value is $100, and I get a grant that's not worth $100, it's worth $10. Right off the bat, I have $90 worth of income because I can buy this lower price of $10.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   So what's happening with Apple right now is they're falling into this fold of investigation. And to put it to be fair, Apple basically uncovered this or at least signaled that they had an internal investigation that found some irregularities in grants.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   There's not a ton of detail about who got these options under what kind of egregious circumstances. So right now there's a lot of unknowns.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But I think the long and short of is that they're not alone and having their books looked at. They're probably just being very cautious in taking a hard look at who got the options, what kind of irregularities they were, and then they're going to take a step back and they're going to restate their income.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And that has an impact not only for the previously filed returns or statements, but also there's tax implications.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I mean, they owe probably money on profits that weren't properly reported. So it's a very long way of saying that I think this is an internal matter. It's probably going to blow over. They're taking on themselves to handle the cells, handle it themselves and kind of see the upshot.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But I think this should be being delisted is not going to be one that will persist more than to the point they actually say, "Hey, look, this is what actually happened."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So in NASDAQ's just trying to kind of keep their code of ethics up, I imagine.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Yeah, I mean, this is really, it's very standard. If you don't file your quarterly report, you go on a list. And if you're on this list, you have a very short period of time to explain why you haven't filed in.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You know, it's just, it's a formal procedure. And I think that all that's happening here is that Apple's saying, "Hey, look, we're going to look at this up, you know, ourselves internally.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   We're going to restate earnings as soon as we know what's going on." And they're just asking NASDAQ to hold up on the delisting while they kind of clean their own house.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And do we, I guess one of the questions is, as users, do we really, how much do we care about the back?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   How does it affect us if they're backed, if a handful of people are back dating their stuff, Scott born in Seattle? How much does this really affect us as users if they're back dating it?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   If a handful of people are back dating.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   As users, I don't think it really matters at all. I've been through some of this same scrutiny.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   My company NetRadio went public back in the mid 90s prior to the dot-bomb.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And we had stock options as a regular form of compensation for our employees and did receive very laborious instruction from our attorneys on how and when we could date them and value them, etc.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I just think it's frankly one of those things that people like to throw stones at anybody that's on top of the mountain because it's usually the other way around.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   You know, NASDAQ isn't going to actually delist Apple. Come on. It's just going to go away.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Right. So, so we shouldn't have to worry about it. We're going to still be able to have fun with that.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I think the interesting thing is like really it's actually a good thing that, you know, it's not the users of the merchandise, like the iPods and the purchasers of the MacBook Pros and the Mac Pros.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It's really it's it's it's for the shareholders. It's just knowing that you have responsible governance in a company.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And, you know, I mean in Apple's defense, I mean, they're, you know, they're basically they're signaling that internal investigation turned up what they deemed to be regularities and they're just they're addressing it.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And rather than file a quarterly statement, they may be inaccurate. They just want to take the time to figure out what's going on and then to clean up.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So I think it's more it's more of a it's more of a shareholder. A shareholder issue than is like a normal customer issue.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Got it. Now on a on a rosier note from all of this, there is a there's a great article here comparing the prices.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   This is you know, this is we're out of the stock stocks. We don't have to compare stocks anymore. We only have to compare the actual comparison of power versus price on the MacBook Pros versus PCs.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   This is in Mac world Mac world.com. We'll put a link in the enhanced version and I guess they're all enhanced versions for Mac break weekly.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And they you know, the it says that the new desktop machines leave no doubt about Mac's price.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Competitiveness, which has always been something that has been a little bit of an issue for Apple.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I mean, everyone says, Oh, yeah, yeah, the computers are better, but they're more expensive.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Is this is this really true? Is it is it really better? Are Mac pros really cheaper than PCs now? Chris?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah, I think they are. If you look at the articles written by Dan Frakes at Mac world and they go head to head with a Dell kind of workstation PC.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And the conclusion was that the Dell was about $1000 more and they had to throw an Apple monitor in there to kind of even it up as well.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The comments we received are that the graphics card could have been a little closer and that would have knocked $300 off the price of the Dell, which would bring it down to $700 more.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But still there's always been this talk out there. The PCs are so much cheaper and the Macs are horribly overpriced.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And if you look at laptops over the last few years, that hasn't been the case.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   If you configure a PC laptop to be comparable to a Mac laptop, generally they're the same price or a little bit more expensive.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So the Mac Pro comes out and the difference seems to be even more dramatic.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   What people are arguing about at this point, because that's what we do, is there a way to present a Mac Pro that is less expensive?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So you're hitting that $1700 to $1800 price point instead of the default configuration of $2500 or having to go with a dual 2GHz processors for $2100.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And I think that's legitimate. I think there does need to be some kind of bridge there between the iMac, which at the top end is $1700 and then the Mac Pro at $25.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And one of the things though is I find that oftentimes if you start to customize your machine, if you start putting this stuff together, if you start really cutting down and saying I don't want all that stuff, I don't want all the stuff that comes with the Mac and you start, like I don't really care about how much RAM or I don't care about certain features,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   then you start wondering the PCs that have less of that tend to be a lot less expensive than the Mac. In that area, a lot of times it almost seems like when we look at a base configuration of a Mac, it's almost always less expensive if you compare it to a Dell.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But if you actually start, for instance, you start adding more RAM or if you start configuring it the way, for instance if I go upwards, if I customize it upwards, it tends to be a lot more expensive than I bought it from Dell.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I mean, is there people considering that at all? Yeah, I think people are considering that because Apple is really sort of presenting you with this one stop solution.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   You're going to get a gigabyte of RAM, you're going to get these processors, it'll be $2,500, you've got to love it and that's it.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   You could easily take a Dell machine that's a little less powerful in terms of processing power and strip it down and you could bring the price weight down.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And also you could have a very, very powerful computer that doesn't have all this stuff. That's cheap. It's just, you know, it may not be as powerful as the Mac Pro, but maybe you don't need a computer that's as powerful as the Mac Pro.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So, I think also some of the upgrade options tend to be on a Mac. For instance, I don't almost ever buy anything extra. I buy like the minimum amount of RAM I can buy. I tend not to buy any extra hard drives.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   When I customize the Mac, I don't customize all that stuff at the Apple Store because I generally know I'm going to pay a lot more for those parts than if I bought them.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   There's not a lot you can do on the Macs now. I mean, right now, RAM is pretty limited. So you can get it through Apple. Crucial, apparently, their RAM isn't quite there yet. There are a couple of other vendors that are starting to come out with it, but it's a specialized kind of RAM that has heat sinks on the RAM chip because they want to take care of that as part of a cooling issue.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   So, if you want an out fully outfitted Mac Pro now, then you do get your RAM through Apple, which is something I never do. You always get kind of the base configuration and add it through third party. Yes, you can add some hard drives as well, but they're not giving you massive amounts of hard drives to this thing.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   What they have made optional is Bluetooth and airport. So wireless, you can add that for another, I think, 80 bucks for the combo, but it takes another couple of weeks to get it.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So, what's their offering? That was the big delay on the shipping one. It's like four or five weeks if you add airport.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Because you can't just put an airport express card in there or a Bluetooth module. It's a very specialized board this time. And if you go to Apple's developer site, you find out there's a little tech note that suggests, and maybe even demands, that an Apple authorized dealer put this thing in.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   So then, if you're looking at the price of the part plus labor for somebody to do it, you kind of scratch your head and wonder why they didn't just include it in the first place unless they were just trying to hit that price point or they didn't have the parts and they just needed to get this thing out.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Right.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Somebody mentioned already the idea that Apple sells solutions and that individual products that could be infinitely customized like a lot of the other defenders that Dell.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   One of the things to remember is that Apple's selling a premium machine and they don't really have any loss leader market at all, whereas Dell and HP want to sell.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I mean, obviously they want to be in that same area where they can sell more expensive machines at higher profit, but they, they, Dell has particularly been trying to keep the average price of their PCs from slipping and PC prices are slipping fast.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Right.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So, the most priced price for last year was something like $750. HP is below that and Dell is slightly above and Dell is considered one of the highest priced mark. I mean, they're, they're leading the more premium PCs, which is something you buy in the top USA.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Right.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   So, in the macro article, looking at some of the features, Apple does you have an option for audio that's less than optical inputs.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Right.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   The Dell are comparing to is just regular headphone jacks.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And so Apple's something a very premium machine.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And when you compare it, when Apple brought out this model, they targeted very competitively right into the middle of a, of Dell's cash cow.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Right.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   So Dell was not, I mean, this is, you know, somewhat of an unfair comparison because Apple could target something they're making a lot of profit on and say, here's a very competitive model.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So, there's just not designed to be competitive at all.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   It's designed to pick up the easy money at the table for people who are buying a $4,000 PC, which is a very limited market.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So, I would imagine Dell have to roll with their prices to match Apple.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And that's going to be more difficult for, for Delta sustained because that's where all their money is coming from.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   It's not coming from the last leaders or so.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's $300 PC's.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Right.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   So, so the areas of Apple.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Go ahead.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   You know, I was going to say, you know, it's kind of interesting is that you're talking, it's almost seems like there's still like this missing price point or this missing product.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I kind of wonder, you know, I just went through the exercise of trying to configure the Mac Pro.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I was like, I was really, I was, I had a verge of buying one.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But when I started adding the things that I really wanted, I mean, the price just escalated so quickly.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And don't I mean, that maybe the thing to do is to wait to see what happens with the introduction of the next Macbook Pro.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   It seems like you could probably get a really great configuration for a system that's kind of just in that in between space between the Mac Pro, you know, the very highest end and maybe the Macbook Pro currently for a, you know, the Mac Mini or the, the iMac.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Right.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I mean, it seems that, you know, just, I think they're, and I think the expectations are going to see something in the next what, like month or so.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   The issue that I have with the Macbook Pro is just that, you know, I really feel like for production, I think for the average person using a Mac, I think that production is, you know, not as important with some of the higher end uses.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   But when you're dealing with, when you really want to do work on it, I really feel like the Mac Pro is, I think I said this in the last show, have really pulled away.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I mean, they're really workstations.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And if you really want to do that kind of work, I almost feel like you really need to get a Mac Pro to get the kind of graphics performance and RAM and so on and so forth.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   So that's the, that's the hard part I have about going between the two is just being able to do to do that.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   From my vantage point anyway.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So anyway, if you want to get your Macbook Pro, the, you know, the apple is coming to Atlantic City.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Now, I don't think you can gamble in the Apple Store in Atlantic City, though I think that would be kind of fun, you know, to have like, wouldn't it be cool to have little iMacs with little jukeboxes?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   I think that would be, I think that would really add a lot to the, to the experience for me anyway.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   The Apple Store is opening tomorrow or will have opened by the time you heard this in the at the pier.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And this is the, of course, there'll be 2000 people probably lined around six blocks to get a chance to walk into an Apple Store.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So what is the deal? Why are people so excited about Apple stores?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Because a lot of this, you know, Gateway tried this and didn't work for them at all.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   But Apple keeps on opening these stores and it's like a, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a, like a concert.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   You know, when they open these, so what makes them so, so interesting to everyone.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Well, when Gateway, when Gateway tried it, everybody got a virus walking in the door.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Well, also you couldn't walk out with a product.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Right.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And so, and that's, I think Dell's thinking about the same model, which is like, it's a showroom.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   But when I walk into a store, I want to leave with something other than a brochure.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   So, and Apple stores are hip too. It's not hip to go to a Gateway store or a Dell store.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yeah, there's, you really, you, you walk in and it feels cool when you get there, you know, and I think that that's something that's
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And I have to admit, I go in, I mean, we, we tend to speak a lot at the Apple store.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   So that, I mean, I go in a lot, but a lot of the classes, you know, a lot of the classes are actually useful.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I get in oftentimes early to do my talk and I end up sitting in classes that are actually good, you know, in the Apple theaters in some of the larger ones anyway.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I think that's a big distinction for a lot of that.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I think that along the same lines that you mentioned, the training that Apple's doing, it helps people who are used to buying computers as kind of a commodity device.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   They're realizing that there's a lot of work that goes into it and there's a lot of experience expenses that you're going to incur if you're not an expert.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And so by buying it from somebody in an environment where you feel like you can bring it in and talk to somebody knows what they're talking about and get free training
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and kind of overview of applications, instead of buying it, you know, Sears, wherever it was trying to sell it on a dusty shelf where people didn't know anything about the product.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It's a totally different experience.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   So Apple can very customize the experience for customers and make them feel comfortable with what they're buying.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And they can see the extra value in that.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   I also think that the genius bar makes a big difference.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I know a lot of the reason.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I mean, I couldn't figure out why people wouldn't line up at 10 a.m.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   every morning with the Apple store in San Francisco is about a hundred feet from our office.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And when I walk by it, if I'm walking by at 10 a.m. there's like 30 or 40 people waiting outside every morning.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And I couldn't figure out what it was until I realized they were all, almost all of them were going to the genius bar to have something looked at, you know.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   And I just find that that expertise and the guys, when I've taken a lot of stuff in there, the guys really actually know what they're talking about.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I mean, it's not like when you go to some larger stores, which will remain unnamed, where you walk in and you know, no one has any idea what they're talking about.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   You know, you feel like they got the job and they're kind of learning along their way, but it seems like Apple really trains their employees to be able to sound good while they're doing it.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Or even pick people who, you know, obviously are deep Mac users.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Yeah, well, they do.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   There's a kind of an audition process.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And then they do put you through some fairly rigorous training so you know what you're doing.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And also they have, you know, the red phones, you can call the mothership if you've got a really tough issue.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   They have a lot of online documentation they can go through.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   They've got procedures that they're accustomed to running through.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   So for example, you bring a dead iPod in.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   They're going to do the same test no matter which gene you need to go to because they know the procedure to deal with it.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   They know exactly what's supposed to happen after that, how they exchange it.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So you do tend to get kind of a consistent experience and a consistent level of expertise.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I think some of the showcase stores like San Francisco or Chicago or New York,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   you get really, really good people there because they want to make sure that the very best are at these stores.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   But just about any Apple store you walk into where they have a genius bar, you're going to get good help.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I want to chip in on the word experience that Chris just said Alex.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   I think that's really the secret here to the success.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Apple gives you an experience.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It's like going to Disneyland.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You don't go for the ride.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   You go for the experience.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And Apple is one of those brands like Harley Davidson that has found out how to tap into this experience mentality.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And that's why people line up to get into their stores.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Yeah, and I think that one of the things that's interesting is that I really think that I don't, at first I thought it was nuts that Apple would.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   You know, there's no way to, there's no way to get any kind of real deals on a Mac.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You know, it doesn't get any cheaper to go anywhere else.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And inside of that, a lot of times what you end up with is this, you really end up with a situation where if it's not going to be any cheaper,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I might as well just go into the store and buy the stuff that I need.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And when I get rid of that stress, I used to think that it was a, you know, I kind of liked looking around for stuff.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   But I really now, I'm kind of, I know I'm probably paying more than I, you know, would if everyone wasn't competing.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   But at the same time, that's taken out of my equation. Like I know that if I go to CompUSA or I go to Apple or whatever, it's all going to be the same price, you know, or within $50 of each other.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   You know, and I think that that for me is really a, it's made it a lot simpler.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And then, then you really get into focusing on just what you said Scott, the experience of the environment.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Which is good, by the way, in a lot of places like you go to CompUSA and they have an Apple expert there.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And the Apple experts, I know at least here in San Francisco, really know what they're doing.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So you do have a choice. And what's funny is a lot of them will freely send you back and forth of CompUSA.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   They can't serve you, they just say, "Yeah, let's go over to the Apple store." You know, that's the kind of an same Apple, the Apple store has sent me CompUSA.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Sorry, what?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I think that's a good point you make about pricing because especially, I mean, America is so enamored with low prices that we've stopped thinking about value of actual things.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And they just want the number to be lower. And so we'll go up way out of our way to buy things mail or turn it over to, or to, you know, get, you know, say, $20. They're going to do the first store.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   But what Apple's doing is trying to compete on features and experience instead of just price.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Because people who pay a little bit less are going to end up not being as happy if they don't get the same kind of service.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And I think people are finding that when they're buying PCs is they can, you know, shave some of the money off, but then they end up with things that they don't like and service that cost far more than 50 bucks they saved.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Right. Now, all of that makes sense of what Apple's doing, but this next one, I'm not sure if it makes sense for me.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And this is, I think Apple's gone pod crazy. Have you guys seen this stuff where Apple is suing people who put pod in the name of their product?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   How can you, how can you trademark pod? Does that, does that Scott in Seattle? Can you, can you trademark pod?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Well, I'm, I think we ought to defer to the ex lawyer here, but I will say that I will say one thing.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I think Apple's one of those companies that seems to find a way in one sentence to make you want to love them and in the next sentence to make you want to hate them.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And this is, this is an extraordinarily negative thing for them to do in my opinion.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I do note that the Jolly Green giant is very nervous about this.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   The Jolly Green giant.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Because, you know, they got those P pods they're trying to sell and I think Apple might come after them next.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   This is like the deal with the bloggers, in my opinion, it's absurd.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Now, Scott can probably tell us that there's some legal reason they have to do this to defend their trademark, etc.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   But come on, I mean, this is another one of those deals where it just doesn't make sense to me.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I mean, here's, to give everyone a little bit of background, there's a company called Mach 5 and they make this thing that, it's a device for wirelessly collecting data from arcade games and other vending machines.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And it's called the profit pod. And of course, you know, and because it comes in a box that has some electronics and it's called a pod, Apple has decided that you can't call it the profit pod.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   You have to call it the profit pack, I guess, or something like that.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Also, the other one is tight pods, rather wonderful, close fitting.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   That's, I'm sorry, I mean, an article out of the register here.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   We'll put a link in it. Wonderful.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   There's a close fitting covers originally designed for power books.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Anyway, so it's tight pods. And once again, you can't call it that.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   That's against the regulation. Scott, New York, is this, do they have to do this?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Well, I mean, to be fair, you know, I did not practice that kind of law.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I didn't get involved in trademark or patent.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   But I think that what they're trying to do is to avoid, I mean, I'm just trying to get, I'm guessing here.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I mean, what the prize is going through their heads is that they don't want the term pod to be so generalized that it loses its impact, you know, for their marketing.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   So, but, you know, I agree with Scott.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   It seems like it's just one of those very heavy-handed approaches that can only generate negative, you know, negative publicity and ill will.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   So I think, I just don't think it's probably the most wise thing and I don't think it'll really go that far.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   But, you know, perhaps they just have some internal, internal some concerns that they're just trying to address. I'm just not sure of.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I mean, we're seeing it a little bit. You know, I don't know if you saw these journalists getting chased down by Google as well.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   That you are not allowed to use Google as a verb.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   So I'm only using this as a description because I don't want to get sued by Google here.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   I think it's, I just think it's against that whole, it's a whole Xerox and Kleenex sort of thing that, you know, things that have importance as marks for the companies that originated.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   The products become so commonplace in, you know, in the vernacular that, you know, they just become, they no longer can be protected as marks because they are just so commonly used.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   So I think Google, I mean, I read that Google issue also. I mean, I guess it's possible. It seems a little far-fetched.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   But, you know, I guess those are the Kleenex and the Xerox issues are probably just what's in the back of their minds.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Well, I do own several trademarks, Alex, and I can tell you the statute does require that in order to maintain your trademark, you do have to defend it.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Right.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   So they might be using that as the excuse. However, the defense has to be reasonable and, you know, the point of the trademark law is to avoid confusion.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So if you're making something that has to do with monitoring the success of arcade games, I don't think any reasonable person's going to conclude that, oh, wait a minute, but that might also play MP3 files.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Right.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And it's just, it's one of those things where you just want to walk up to somebody at Apple and just smack them and go, "What the heck are you guys thinking?"
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   But that's probably illegal too.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   I think it's typical of Apple that they're going after the little guys on this, you know, just as they went after the bloggers about leaking information, they went after little blogger websites.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   And when the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal do exactly the same thing, there wasn't a peep out of Apple Legal.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Sure, it was a different time front too.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   When the talk about Apple going after little guys here, it's because no one else is, if Microsoft came out of the product called MSPod, obviously they go out for them too.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And if those other companies entice people to break their NDAs to publish information as secrets, which no real general journals were doing in the several weeks before they introduced it, they would have done the same.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   But with the idea that this already been mentioned about, they have a really illegal obligation to defend their trademarks.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And obviously some of it's going to sound like they're going after excessive things, but the two products are mentioned there.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   One is a product that is designed to wrap computer products.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And the other is this device that connects into games or whatever.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   But both of those are in the same area as on Apple's iPod.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And if Apple has a blind eye for various products that are going on, so something pod, then they won't have a latest demo when some significant thing comes long, and they try to defend their trademark.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   And the trademark company says, well everything's a something pod related to players or devices or anything.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   So what Apple's doing here is reasonable.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   It sounds bad, and the reason we're caring about it is because it's an Apple story.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   An Apple story is going on the front page.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   But if you're looking at another example with a trademark that got out of hand, you already mentioned Google and Kleenex, but think about some of these Walkman.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Twenty years ago, everything that played a cassette was called a Walkman.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Regardless of where they came from stuff, and that's what everybody called, just like everybody in South calls every sort of cook.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   If Apple continues to allow people to use iPod or iPod.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I guess I would say, the thing is, I understand the controlling iPod.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I understand that if you have an MP3 player that has pod in it, I understand that.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   But Apple didn't come up with the word pod.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   That's the problem that I have.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I mean, it's a very widely understood thing, and that's what to me makes it.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And saying, I think Apple's going to lose both of those cases.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I don't think they're going to win it.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I don't think what it does is it creates a chilling effect for people who, you know, what Apple's doing is warning you that, yeah, we may not win, but we're going to cost you $100,000 in legal bills.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Wasn't there, when skins were all the rage for a little pop-up media players, and this is going back to like the mid sort of like late 90s, there were things called pods.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   There was a company that was wrapping skins around a real player.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Some form of like a win amp, and those things were called pods.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   I mean, just the concept of pod is a wrap-around device, yeah, has been around for a while.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So I think, you know, I think, and also, I mean, the real test, again, like, that's not my true background is not in trademark, but I mean, I think also it's, as Scott was touching on it, it's the issue is confusion.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And it's like, is someone really confused by the word pod once associated with a coin collector versus, you know, an MP3 player?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Anyway, I just, you know, I just think it's, I think Apple should, I don't know.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I don't know what they should do, but I just feel like it's just silliness.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So to get to something a little bit more techie, Intel is, there's rumors about that Intel might be beefing up their chip designs, their graphics designs.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Now, of course, this affects us now because we're all Intel users, or we're becoming Intel users.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Of course, ATI has been bought by AMD, and obviously we're going to see a lot of integration there, you know, Nvidia is there.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   It's a big, obviously doing really, really well.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So Intel has this, the rumors are that Intel is actually going to be beefing up their discrete graphics chip.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   So the possibility of maybe coming out with their own boards or their own integrated chips, is this a good thing for us?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Is competition always good, or are we going to end up with some kind of integrated chip design that means that we get less over time?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Does anyone have any?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   It is good, and if Intel's integrated graphics aren't competitive, Apple will look bad in those chip non-integrated graphics.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   But remember that a lot of the bad connotation with integrated graphics comes from a time when integrated graphics weren't at all competitive, and today they are for some applications, for some things or not.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   But integrated graphics aren't necessarily bad.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Chris, what do you think? Do you think that this is a good thing?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Do you think that this is a good thing?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Yeah, I think it could be a good thing.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And Apple has never been shy about changing vendors.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   If it's going to make for a less expensive part for them, they bounce back and forth between Nvidia and ATI.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And they've done the same thing with the innards of the iPod.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   They've just changed processors on that because they can get better value out of the parts in there and more capabilities.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   So if Intel can provide a compelling product to a price that's attractive to Apple, sure, I think they'll show them.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   On the high end, do we really think that an Intel chip is going to compete, for instance?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Because right now for us, I think we can all assume that by the middle of the next year, ATI will be largely dead to us.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   But can the Intel chips really compete with the Nvidia chips, for instance, can Intel catch up to where Nvidia is?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Well, on the high end, you have the option.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   If you're talking about a Mac Pro, you can put whatever compatible graphics card you can in there.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You have mostly the option.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   One of the things that I think Apple has been woefully behind on is actually putting in, allowing us to have a lot of,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   especially with the MacBook Pro now, allowing us to have really a lot of truly powerful graphics cards.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   We get the 4500 out of Nvidia, but Nvidia has a whole line of Pro cards,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   including ones that are very, very important to the upper end production that Apple has not either not given an Nvidia
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   that support to build their own drivers, because Apple likes to write all its own drivers, and they haven't written them.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And it's fine to give us just one card, but they really need to support on the upper end if they're going to build these machines that have 16 gigabytes of RAM.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   They've got to support all of them, don't they?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I don't know that they have to support all of them, but they certainly have to give you something that when you look at the specs,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   you say, "By God, I want that machine," rather than jumping to somebody else's machine.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   So I think they have to offer compelling products and make enough deals so that you, if you're not impressed with this one,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and you are impressed with that other board, at least you have that one other option or a couple of other options, rather than doing the entire spectrum.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Right.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Cool. Now, also on the hardware end of things, we've got Bootcamp has been upgraded.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   How many of you guys are using Bootcamp in one way or another?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Anyone?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I am.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   You're using it, Chris?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Does anyone else have an Intel Mac?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I'm using Bootcamp to roll out Mac groups too, as Windows computers for clients.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Okay.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   So if a client is for a, so if one of your clients wants a PC, are you suggesting that they just get a Mac and run it over to PC?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I am suggesting that clients that have mixed-use laptops via Apple and image them as needed.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Right.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   And a number of, I wrote an article, I'm writing a series of articles on how to use Mac Bootcamp, but I got a lot of response from other people around the country that are doing the same thing.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   They're giving their clients Macs, image to Windows so that they don't even know that they're running an app.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Right.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Now, is it, what do you guys think of the, of parallels compared to Bootcamp, for instance?
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Parallelism is a more appropriate thing for most Mac users who are savvy with using a virtual, like a virtual PC tech product.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It's, it doesn't work for, obviously, if you're just trying to roll out a Mac book as a Windows machine, that's not a great solution, but it's doing that except for some of this.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   And there's also a few people that would benefit from running Windows directly on the hardware, for example, for games.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Other than that, if you just want to run a few, and there's applications, parallelism is a very good product.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I mean, and their parallels is doing okay, I guess I saw a report this week that they sold a hundred thousand copies of, of parallels for running Windows on a Mac.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   So it's, they're, this little process of theirs has become fairly successful.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   It looks like a lot of people want to do it.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   It's a good product and it works well and it looks nice.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And it's competitively priced too, I think that's, I think that's really interesting because one of the problems with virtual PC is that it was really expensive.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   You know, given that you, you know, you had to use, all had to also, you know, get all this, I guess it, it also came with Windows though.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   That was the part of the distinction there, but the, now the thing is I use, I tend to use Bootcamp, so I'm using Bootcamp for most of the stuff.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   The reason I do it is because I'm using Softimage's XSI, which only runs on the, on the PC and it needs a lot of the graphics processing and it needs all of that stuff there.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Now, the one of the things that's important for people listening, if you're using Bootcamp, you do want to do the upgrade because it fixes some keyboard issues.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   There were some keyboard mapping issues that were there and I'm just about to start testing it here, but according to this it should be working.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And for instance, in XSI I couldn't actually, you know, delete.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I could only add to my project, but, but deleting through the keyboard was impossible.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And so I'm hoping that, yeah.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Alex, over at the islivesone.com, we're running a poll right now.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   We say, "Have you tried Windows on your Mac?"
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And it's not a scientific poll, but I thought I'd share the results.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Presently we have 4.3% saying, "Yes, they've tried Parallels, 4.3% saying, "Yes, they've tried Bootcamp, 12.8% saying they've used both, 34% saying, not yet."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And then the camp that I'm in, 44.7% saying, "Are you kidding?"
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   If I wanted Adwares by Wear and Viruses, I would just buy a PC.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Yeah, I think that I have to admit what's odd about it is that I have barely touched the PC for a long time.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   And I've been known earlier in my life to turn down entire jobs because I didn't want to work on a PC.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And I'm using PC's more, I use Windows more now than I did when I was in those times because I can just restart.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And for me, there's a lot of graphic.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   What drags me over, which is why people buy PCs in the first place.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And this has made it easy for me, is that what drags me over to the Windows side is that there are applications that aren't available on the Macs.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And of course, what I want them to do is make an OS X version.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And one of the things I'm afraid of is that we're going to see less OS X conversions because it's so easy now to switch over to either using parallels.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Does this really slow down people porting to OS X?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I don't think many people are going to be using Windows Bootcamp parallels things to do software products that are in a way that's going to prevent them from getting adopted natively on Mac OS X, except for hard, possibly with games.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   PC games are a huge segment that isn't on the Mac.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   And I'm talking about serious PC gamers.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And that's not likely to change anyway, but Bootcamp and two of lesser scenarios actually opens that market up.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And do we really need a native port of some of these games because they don't have any interface.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   They don't deal with other applications on desktop.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   They're not really related to the operand system much at all.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Why not just run on the Windows?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Well, mine is not so much games as much as a graphics person. There's a much of professional high-end graphics tools that are only available on the PC.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And we were waiting for them thinking that they were going to port over, but now that you can just restart a lot of them when you talk to them privately, they're trying to now figure out whether they should actually do the port or not.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   So that's the issue that may affect some of us through all of that.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   But anyway, also on the hardware side, have you guys, has anyone used ITV?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Yeah. Do you like it?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   I do. It's not Tivo yet.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Right.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Because one of the things that my main complaint about ITV is it doesn't do IR blasting.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   So what's IR blasting?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Oh, I have a satellite set about here because I'm in the bloonies.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And in order to use Tivo, I have to connect something called an IR blaster, which is a little cable that runs out of the back of my satellite, or out of the back of the Tivo, and points two little LEDs at the front of my satellite receiver.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   So that when Tivo wants to change channels because of a schedule, it sends out that little IR blast to the satellite receiver, and then it changes channels for me.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   ITV doesn't do that.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   It's a product that's manufactured in Germany, and they don't do a lot of that stuff.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   They have open cable and a lot of digital over-the-air signals, which you can do easily.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   You can change channels with no problem on the ITV.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   But here in the States, where we have encrypted cable and satellite, you really need something.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   If you're going to make a useful schedule that's going to change channels for you, and it doesn't do it, there are really arcane methods for doing it by using a USB IR blaster plus an Apple screw.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Things to make that happen.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   But nothing seamless.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   No, I've done it once, and it took like a day and a half to set it up.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   And once you get it going, it's okay, but using it through iCal, and it's just monstrous.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But the picture is good.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   I'm using an older ITV, and I'm actually going to be reviewing a couple of new products.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And it looks fine.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I've got my satellite box set up here to record HBO on Sunday night, so I get deadwood, and it's got a nice little button.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   It rips it directly to my iPod automatically.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   That's one of the advantages over the TiVo thing, is that it's really portable.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   There's nothing, there's no DRM, there's no in the box kind of control.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   It's really all available all the time.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Yeah, and it is great, because you can get into your TiVo if you have to, if you go through a series of hacks.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   But there are a lot of people who have no idea how to do it.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   The instructions aren't terribly clear.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   If you can do command line stuff and do Unix, you can get into it.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   But using ITV, you're set.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   You don't have to worry about that at all.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And the difference is, I have both the old digital and the analog.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   What's newsworthy right now is that A, you can now get a tuner that will work with both analog and digital.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   So this new little box that they just came out with this week, I believe, will let you bring analog signals or digital signals in and record them.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   The second thing is, and this has been out for a little bit, but these things are we.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I mean, they're like, this is like the size of like a USB key now.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Yeah, they just plug right into the port and it used to be, you'd have to get an ITV 500 to do over the air HD.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   And now you've got this little stick that does it for $150.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Yeah, and it's crazy when you look at it.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I mean, I've done it, they let, they lent one to us and it was, I couldn't believe, you know, that I'm sitting there watching it, you know, in our office.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And it was just, it was pulling these HD signals, some of them over the air straight in.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   It's really good in some parts of San Francisco.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   In a lot of San Francisco, you can't get anything. I mean, if you're not plugged into cable.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   So, but I was just pulling off the air.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   So anyway, it's kind of a cool little piece there.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And if you're using it, of course, the rumors are flying about around the new, is there going to be a Wi-Fi iPod?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Now, the rumors are that there's going to be a Wi-Fi iPod.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Apple says, "No, there's not going to be a Wi-Fi." They're pretty adamant about it, too.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   You know, usually Apple doesn't say anything.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   So do we, do we think we're going to get a Wi-Fi iPod? Does anyone, does anyone wait and anyone holding their breath?
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Why is the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, I don't know, I'm sorry, say that again?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   What is the, what is the idea that you'd be able to synchronously?
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I think that the idea, I mean, all these other upcoming ones are really, you know, because of like the Zoom,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Microsoft's Zoom player is expected to be wireless, where you'd be able to theoretically be able to sync with your computer.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   You'd be able to download, you know, theoretically be able to download songs, you know, while you're sitting at Starbucks.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   You know, you wouldn't have to go through your computer.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   I have to admit that I find it.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I've gotten to the point where I find it a little cumbersome, for instance, to get a podcast and have to plug it into my computer.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   I'd love to have my iPod at home be syncing to my podcasts without ever plugging into my computer.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   I think that's the, I think that's what, what people think might happen.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Does anyone, do people, do we, do we think we're going to see an iPod, a Wi-Fi iPod this, this fall?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   That's kind of an interesting idea that the Wi-Fi sync, although Wi-Fi compared to Firewire or USB 2, is an over-energy slower.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   It's syncing with my iPod, being, when I'm syncing in iTunes and I'm getting this week in tech or Mac break weekly, I am, that's happening at whatever speed it's happening at, but it's still over Wi-Fi to my laptop at home, you know, because I don't have anything at
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   the Internet core at home. So, so it's that same speed, it's just that the iPod, you know, if I leave the iPod plugged into something, it would just go full.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Are you talking about wireless connecting to your computer to download?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   No, I think it's connected to the Internet.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   I think I'm talking about connecting to the Internet.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Okay, so I would say wireless connecting to your computer would be somewhat slow.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   The Internet would be insane, because it would require huge amounts of processing. I mean, the iPod is a product.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   The reason it's called the pod is because it has this note, there's no brain in it. I mean, obviously there is a brain in it, and it does a lot of processing.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   What I'm saying is there's very little that it has to actually do. All it has to do is play stuff back.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   All the, all the actual sorting and content and management and everything is, and the DRM is all handled by the Mac.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   So when you hand from sync the Mac to the iPad, which you're iPad, all you're doing is copying content.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   If you delegate all that work of getting podcasts and managing, you know, basically put iTunes on the iPod, you're going to have a much more expensive iPod.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   And it's going to use batteries like no tomorrow.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Well, I mean, one thing, one argument about that though is that the number one is the PSP does this already.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   You know, the PSP you can, you can.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Yeah, it needs to be as a computer into itself.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   But, and a lot of people will say though that the iPod has a lot more horsepower hidden in there than they've ever used.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   You know, whatever's going on in that chip, it's a lot, there's a lot more there than what Apple is actually using in the process.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   And I don't think we're talking about possibly a web browser, but I think that...
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Well, there's crazy USB capacity running the iPod, you know, it's decoding video.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   But putting all that work into managing seems like you're a peanut butter.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   So to have on a device that's designed to keep the iPod.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Right.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   I would like to see a, you know, a Newton for Apple that had all those features in it, but I kind of don't think that's been added.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Anyone else?
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Does anyone, do we think that we're gonna, does anyone, does anyone care whether they see a wireless iPod?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   I don't care, but I sure as heck love to have a Newton again.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Yeah, I bought the, I bought the first Newton in the big New York opening and I tell you what, of all my prized possessions in my life, at the time I bought it, that was, that was my favorite thing and I sure miss it.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Because everything I've had since just isn't as cool.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Yeah, I, for me, you know, I'm gonna be happy when I have my, my wireless, my wireless iPod that can do GPS so I can look at little maps and they can play music, depending on where, or more importantly directions depending on where I am.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And it can, I don't really care about answering the phone because if it's wireless for me, all I want is iChat.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   You know, in the, in my know, and we've already discussed that this will take a lot more processing power and more batteries and everything else, but I'd love to be able to do iChatting.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Directly from my, from my iPod, I probably use my, my phone half as much, especially you start.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   It'd be great to have some nice stuff.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Do you, do you put any stock in any of those, you know, I'm sure we're not seeing the rounds of, like, think secret and apple insider.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   The, those patent claims, or I'm sorry, the patent filings where they have, there's images of these touch, it looks like a larger tablet, it certainly doesn't look like an iPod.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   It's a larger form tablet device. Do we think there's any possibility of something that we haven't really considered yet being in the works or?
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   I mean that's.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   I hope so. I hope so. I'd like to be surprised.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   No, in apple, I think that we might have something coming up. I mean, I just, as I said, I think that, I mean, I think the next big thing, I mean, it's heating up.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   I mean, I know I become addicted to my, my little GPS receiver.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   You know, I have a little, uh, one of those, um, I don't know which one I have right now.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Alex, you need GPS in order to walk down the hill from your apartment to your office.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   You know, I, you know, it may seem crazy, but yes, I get lost. I get lost all the time. I'm walking, you know, getting all the way from Knob Hill down to the financial district is very complicated.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   There's a lot of little treats there.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Alex, you don't own a car, dude.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   I'm not a full, yeah, but I, but I rent one. No, I, you know, I rent lots of cars. You know, I've gotten very good at that. You know, uh, the funny thing though is the reason I'm hooked on GPS, I bought GPS because I hate, I hate driving in LA.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   It's a traumatic experience for me, you know, and, and I'm constantly lost and I somehow always end up back in a parking lot. They call the 405 and, um, and it's not really a, they call it a highway, but it really is a parking lot.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   I mean, it's, it's like Macy's, the Macy's extended parking lot. And, um, so I'm always trying to find ways to avoid the 405 and, uh, and so I bought this Tom Tom GPS that works with my, with my little trio and now it's just, like, it's just, it's, it's, it changed my whole life.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   You know, to be able to sit there and know exactly where I am and I can just start making new routes and it just keeps on figuring out the best way to get there. If I decide I don't want to get on some road and I don't have to think about it.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I don't have to know anything about the city, you know, and now people try to give me directions and I don't want to know anything about it. All I want is their address address and zip code. I'll put it in the Tom Tom will tell me, you know, where to turn right and left. I don't want to know about it.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And, and the thing is, is it's not, that's not, I mean, that's why I like GPS, but what's interesting to me is the idea of having audio activated GPS is really, really interesting to me.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   And that means that, you know, like, for instance, I want to give you a tour of Civil War battlefields through Virginia. I can have you, I can, you know, give you the tour and depending on where you are within 10 feet and it says, okay, if you look over here, this is where Stonewall Jackson, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, and it's doing all that stuff.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   That's a whole different level of podcasting based on actually where you are.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   I like the notion of it, but I think this whole adding more stuff to the iPod goes against the philosophy of the iPod, which is keep it as simple as you can.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Well, maybe you call something different.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Yeah, no, I think it's, I think there's another device out there somewhere, but it's not, it's not the iPod.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Remember the graphic that jobs had done of the guy carrying the like the iPod that was monstrous in size to kind of make fun of the notion that the video needed to be bigger?
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Although that said, I do think there's a widescreen iPod coming out next.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   That will be one thing we see in maybe wireless headphones, but through probably a dock connector attachment rather than by default.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   And by the way, I think there's a lot of credence in that because like Leo, I tend to buy things from Apple right before they upgrade them.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Oh, so you just put it up, video iPod?
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   Yeah, so I think you all should just plan on any day. That'll be a new one.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Right. Now, now hopefully, possibly even a, I mean, a pushing Apple this way.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   I'm not sure Apple's already going this way.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Have you guys seen this little Rover TV?
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Have you seen this little, I think it just got released?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   So this is a little, it's called Rover TV and it's, you can get two different versions.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   There's the big screen and the widescreen, but it's, it's as little, you know, it's like a little iPod except the whole front screen is opened.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And, you know, I have to admit, I'm, you know, I love my video iPod, but I really think that this guy is, you know, really cool.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   You know, I think that, you know, I think it's something that should start to hopefully, I feel like Apple is, I understand that there's rumors that there's some kind of technical difficulty, but I really feel like the market is very pregnant for a slightly larger play device.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   I think you're right, but I looked at the Rover TV site and I was really trying to figure out how you're supposed to get video on this thing.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   It's a smart card. It's a smart card.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Yeah, but there's no, there's sort of like no software solution as there is with the iPod where you've got iTunes that's going to do all your encoding.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   It's going to get it on there. Instead, it's sort of like, if you can get your MPEG-4 video files on here, cool.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   We'll play it out.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Yeah, but we sort of want you to go through, you know, jump through whatever hoops to do it.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And I would like to see that integrated solution where you just pop it into a dock. It will rip your stuff for you, puts it on there, and you're ready to go.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   I think there's no lack of portable media players in the market. I mean, if you kind of check Engadget or Gizmodo on a daily basis, there's always some feature of some really cool new PMP that's coming out of Korea that plays 264, plays MPEG-4, and, you know, it's just feature rich.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   It's almost like it's like the, it's not that the video player is going to be anything really unique when it comes to us. It's just going to be that it's Apple coming out with it.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Yeah, and it'll fit. I mean, this is how Apple, I mean, they don't have to be the first one there. They just have to be, except for the with the express card, which we wanted to get into.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   That was the same, the same as with when the author was introduced, Apple didn't invent the idea of a hard disk-based simply through-player.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   But Apple just made it easier. You know, so easy to use. Anybody can use it. And it's reliable and it's built well.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   Yeah, and that's why we got it. Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Now, now...
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   The secret, the secret to all these things, Alex, is the iTunes Music Store.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Right.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   And if there's no iTunes Music Store, like, interface, I don't care if it's the rover or what it is. Like Scott was just saying, you know, the Epson P2000 and various iterations of that have been out for years.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   That didn't do anything to supplant the market share of iPods that do video.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I just think without the beautiful interface of iTunes Music Store and iTunes Video Store, none of this stuff's going to matter.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   There's a zillion MP3 players out there trying to compete with iPods. None of them matter because nobody's got the iTunes Music Store.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Yeah, and I think that I think sometimes I get a little, you know, I lose track of that only because most of the stuff that I watch on my video iPod, for instance, the stuff that I cooked up my phone.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   I didn't download it.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Yeah, but you did like the special effects for Star Wars, man. Not everybody got that skill.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   My grandma isn't going to be sitting there rendering stuff through the camera.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I don't cook it up myself. I mean, I'm really good at handbrake light.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   So, that's, you know, I like to watch, you know, I am looking for whole movies.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   You know, I want to see whole movies on my iPod. I know it sounds... A lot of people don't think that you could watch something for two hours and I could tell you from a lot of experience that you can't do anything.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   Especially while standing in a two-hour line at TSA in the airport.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   You can actually make it... I've made it through an entire movie standing in line waiting to get on a plane.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   So now that said, the Lionsgate CEO broke the... He said in a financial report that they've already finished the deal with Apple to get these movies all the way out someday.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Someday we're actually going to actually see it. I think this is kind of old news at this point because we just keep on hearing it.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   It's one of those things like, "When are we actually going to see it?" We're not sure if we're going to see it.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   We thought we might see it, you know, jobs typically talks about the keynote.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   You know, does the keynote in Paris, but evidently he's not going to be there.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Yeah, no, I think this is a special event announcement in September, October.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   They'll release the 6G iPod with it. They'll unveil the iTunes movie store and it's done.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Yeah, so hopefully you're right. I'm getting a little impatient.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Now, is there a credence to this rumor that Jobs is pretty excited about the iPhone?
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   Is this really going to... Do we think we're really going to see some kind of phone that does something like that?
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   I would hope so. I wrote about some articles about the phone and the iPod.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   I don't think that any phone coming from Apple will be built upon an iPod, but it'd be a good phone.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Same thing with the iPod. It wasn't trying to be anything else Apple already had.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   It was trying to be a good music player and that's all it does.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   And I'm sure a new phone will have capacity to play, you know, quick-tent media files.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   But I think it will be first and foremost a phone or, you know, whatever else is the core feature.
[00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   I think a phone would have less utility than kind of a new product centered on communicating in general.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Because there's a lot of people that, especially these kids nowadays, that SMS more than they use the phone.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   And that's kind of the preferred way of talking with SMS.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   So I mean Apple could come out with an SMS device that they all kinds of messaging.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   I kind of described two directions Apple could go. I called one iPod blogger.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   And it was kind of the next generation idea for iPod.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   It was an Instagram kind of SMS messaging and also capturing video and doing pictures and kind of integrated with all the high-life apps.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   And then kind of the other direction of being the iPod product, which would be closer to a trio.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   And kind of after looking at just kind of speculating what Apple could do, they would both be very similar to having different sub-marketing.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   Right, right, right.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   So they could come out with a phone that isn't a typical phone that we expect.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   And if they add the scroll wheel, it'll be kind of like you could dial and it'll be just like playing Tempest.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Anyone remember, you know, wouldn't that be great?
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   It'd be like a little Tempest dialer. So I wonder about the whole carrier issue.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   I mean, who's going to carry this phone?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   Yeah, that's why some part of me feels like they're not going to do a phone just because, you know, why deal with the carriers when Wi-Fi is growing.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   They have the likes to have control.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Right, and they don't have control with those people.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   And in a Wi-Fi environment, I feel like, you know, they don't need to give, they don't need to see control to anyone.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   You know, that to me, that seems to be the more likely. I mean, that's what I have to admit, that's what I want.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   I mean, I just prefer, I mean, especially when you look at Mountain View, I mean, Google has now made all of Mountain View wireless.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   Actually, they have a master plan that I know a little bit about.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   Steve Jobs is going to buy Verizon and then sue everybody that uses the word "cell phone" in the name.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   And then fire anybody that works for Verizon that talks to the media about anything.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   And then sue every blogger in the country that mentions the word "cell phone" and then all of the problems will go away and we'll get our iPod cell phone.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   There you go. There you go.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   Now, on this, also on this video route, it looks like now that there's rumors now that YouTube is going to provide just about every video ever made for free.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   On to YouTube.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   You know, which is that going to... And I have to say that the 199 from Music Video, 199 for Lost or something like that makes sense.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   199 from Music Video is a little on the nutty side, unless it's really, really, really good.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   So, YouTube, Bush and it free. Do you think iTunes is Apple going to react? Are they going to care?
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   You can get all these music videos for free somewhere else.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   I saw Apple was just advertising a promotion. I don't know how recent it is, but the idea of buying a music video for Don Day 9 and getting a music track as well,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   or since I can... A bit of a... You know, you're getting used to anyway.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   But kind of selling the idea that, you know, here's, you know, a extra dollar throughout and you get a little video to watch too.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Right.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   I don't really understand YouTube's business model. It sounds kind of dot com.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   It's kind of like selling dog goods to the mail. It's like, is that really a good idea?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Bush, do we offer him that video?
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Well, it's a lot of eyeballs and it's possible advertising.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   I mean, I think that's the, you know, the idea that everyone's going to those things.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   I think a lot of what YouTube's challenges is that YouTube's real challenges is finding legitimate... Not legitimate, but really mainstream ways of working with organized media
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   and being able to generate revenue from eyeballs, you know, connected to all of that.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   You know, I think that's, to me, that seems where they're going. I could be wrong.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   I mean, YouTube is very much like, you know, the video version of Napster.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   Yes and no.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   I mean, I think the big thing...
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   There's really not much you want to watch on YouTube that is entirely...
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Oh!
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   I mean, there's some, you know, YouTube stuff that is there in kind of a nice and fun app that makes you search the way.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   But if you look at the most, if you look at the most viewed things on YouTube, it's actually stuff that a lot of the most viewed stuff is not a large percentage of it.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   Of the things that have been viewed the most are not copy-written material.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   And that's, that I think a lot is their legal, their legal defenses that combined with that combined with the fact that they'll take anything down that someone asks them to take down.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   I think they're the two things that are kind of protecting them.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   They say that these new videos or any of the YouTube videos, of course, they're talking about, they won't be compatible with your iPod.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   Although, I don't know who they are.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   Have you, have you used PodTube?
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   I use TubeSock.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   TubeSock?
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Does TubeSock work for you?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   Yeah, it's 15 bucks. You can get it from stinkbot.com.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   No, it's great. I swear to God, this is a great thing.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   It puts a little link in your browser and you go to YouTube and you say send to, send a TubeSock.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   It processes it for you and it puts it into your iTunes library.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   The same, the PodTube does a similar thing if you have it opened.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   So it doesn't sound like it's quite as seamless as TubeSock.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   But PodTube, if you have it opened and you have, you have to be in Safari.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   So can you be in with TubeSock?
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Maybe in Firefox or Safari. But yeah, you have to actually have the video open.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   You don't have to be playing it. But from there, it encodes the Flash into an MPEG-4.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Or actually H.264.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   I just did it the other day because I saw it and I had to see if it would actually work.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   I successfully and quickly compressed an incredible movie of a little monkey falling asleep almost instantly, which was a typical YouTube clip and nice and short.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   And it worked seamlessly. I was amazed. I was watching on my iPod within minutes of watching that.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   So we'll see if that's not too much of an issue there.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   The last thing, I think because we're running pretty long here, the last thing, this is just something that I just ran across.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   So have any of you been using any alternatives to GarageBand?
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   Of course, we're talking in podcasts here. Has anyone here used any of the alternatives to enhance their podcasts other than to GarageBand?
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   Because GarageBand came out there. There have been some other ones and then GarageBand came out and it seemed like it killed everything off.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   But now there's a couple of these little programs that are coming up that allow you to put the stuff together.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Has anyone actually used any of them?
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   I've used Ubercaster recently. It's in beta.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   And it is very easy to use. It does require kind of a new way of thinking if you're used to doing things on GarageBand.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   And we'll see what happens when it gets out of beta, but I think that it has some potential.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   I happen to think that the seamlessness of GarageBand makes it pretty powerful and valuable.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   There is the issue of export. You have to export in certain predetermined formats and you have to compress on export, which is bad for some people.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   But the average person doing a podcast probably gets an awful lot out of GarageBand.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   And if Apple continues to ramp it up as they've been doing all the iLife applications, I think it's going to always be a player.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Now you mentioned another one, Alex.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   I just downloaded yesterday. I have to admit, I was working on TWIM this week in media.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   And I was really excited about it. So I really wanted to make a nice enhanced version because we had this great talk about film versus digital with a bunch of guys in LA.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   And so I'm putting this thing together.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   And finally I just couldn't take it anymore. I was just so frustrated with GarageBand.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   I was like, I'm not going to use this. I'm going to go find something else.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   And so I just started doing, I mean, I didn't have any background. I just started doing Google.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I started doing searches on Google, TM.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   I did not, under any circumstances, do anything that would remotely be like googling something.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   I just want to keep that clear within our piece here.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   But I found this one called Podcast Maker.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   And Podcast Maker is made by a company called Potion Factory.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   I think it's like 30 bucks or something like that, shareware.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   But they've got a 30 day version, so I downloaded it.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   And I have to say, here's the thing that I liked the most about what I was working with.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   And that is, number one, is I compressed it. What happens is, and not a lot of people doing Podcasts are doing it all in GarageBand.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   And inside of that, when you're adding all the music and you're doing all that stuff, it probably makes sense.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   When you're, I do all the post production and soundtrack pro, because of course I have Final Cut Pro Studio.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   And so I do all my post production and soundtrack pro when I'm putting stuff together.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   And then I just have this audio track. So I export it as an AIFF.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   And then I bring it into, I compress it in my high tech iTunes to exactly what I want, because I can set all my settings.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   The problem with GarageBand is no matter what I do, no matter how I hiccup,
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   once I've compressed it to like an MP4, not an MP4, but an AAC, GarageBand is going to want to recompress it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   And it's going to want to recompress it in a way that I don't want it to recompress it as.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I don't want it to, I don't want 32 bit, I want 64 bit mono. And there's no way to do that.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   So if I send it out of iTunes, now I got it in, I can bring it in.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   And what Podcast Maker does is it's just going to add to the AAC I already created.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   So it doesn't recompress any of the audio at all, it's just going to add the XML data on top of it to create the chapters.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   And so you can go through there. One of the cool things, by the way, is that I listen, I tend to listen to it at twice the speed.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   So I'm listening at 2X most of the time, so that I can be listening.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   I'm already in the podcast, I don't need to listen to the whole thing at 1X again.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   And by the way, most people can listen to a podcast at 1.5X.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   And this is a quick time feature, by the way. If people don't know, if you have QuickTime Pro, you can actually,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   if you go into some of the, I don't know where it is, it's one of the features.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   In QuickTime Pro, you can actually change the speed and listen to everything or watch movies slightly faster than what they're designed to be watched at.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   But you can listen to it really quickly, you can add those chapters, you can put the stuff in, and it's much faster.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   It doesn't look as pretty, there's no, it's not as graphical, but it's much faster.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   I found that it was 2 to 3 times faster to put it together in Podcast Maker than it was in GarageBand.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   And when I save, and this is important, with GarageBand for an 1 hour podcast, GarageBand is like,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   that's 10 or 15 minutes of it doing whatever it does. And this one is less than a minute, you know, for it to do the export,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   which was also important to me. And so, so I really found exciting.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   There are problems with the Podcast Maker. One is that you can't, or at least I don't know of any way,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   that you can create a series of links or a series of pictures without creating a chapter track.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   So a lot of times in Pod, in GarageBand, we're talking about a single subject.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   That single subject I want to have a chapter about, but I want to keep on showing you new links and new pictures related to it.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   In GarageBand that's a pretty simple process. I haven't found a way to do that effectively in Podcast Maker,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   but it's definitely worth checking out. And so, I don't know if anyone else doing anything else,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   or are they just using GarageBand or not a hand-in-hand?
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   I just Podcast Maker as well. There is one other issue, which is pretty obscure, but if you're doing an enhanced podcast,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Podcast Maker is doing something to it so they don't play correctly on a 1 in 2G iPod.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   I talked to developers about it and they said, "Huh, I guess we'll have to find an old iPod."
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   And that was the last I heard from him.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   Does anyone have a 1 in? You know, my problem is is that I buy a new iPod when Steve talks about it.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   You know, so I kind of have, I have like this long line of iPods that we constantly have.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   I have a 2G that I just found, I think the battery is dead for good, but yeah, so I didn't think of that.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   So that is an obscure one, but there are people out there that their battery is still intact from 2G, right?
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   Yeah, and Macworld uses Podcast Maker to encode its stuff and do the tags.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   So I hear from Macworld's podcast listeners who say, "I've got this old iPod and won't work what's going on."
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   I still have a mystery. So hopefully, hopefully they'll figure out what the heck is going on.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   So I think we've come to the end of this long journey.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   I think it's been a lot of fun. This is our episode 2 and hopefully, and I guess, now Scott is actually going to be helming.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   Scott Born, Scott Brooks is sitting there going, "What is he talking about?"
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   Scott, you're going to be helming it next week?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   I'm helming is a trademark phrase. I'm going to be at the helm.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   Right. You are going to be in a managing the process of having a conversation.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   We can keep it away from any kind of words that might get us in trouble.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   I will be here next week to make sure that we stay on point and Chris and I on the 20th of August will be available at the sister site at iLifeZone.com.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   To give you 34 tips about your Mac in 40 minutes.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   It's awesome, by the way.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   You were there too.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   I was in the middle of all of the stuff in iLifeZone.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   I was learning a lot.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   So there was a bunch of us sitting around and we just went from the three of us and then also Derek's story and Ben Long.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   It was just this round robin and I was a little overwhelmed, but fortunately, we all came up with some good stuff.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   You held up your end.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   The problem was that Chris kept piggybacking off my tips, but other than that, it was a great show.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   Well, you were hogging all the good ones.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   Anyway, this was a lot of fun, Alex. Thanks for letting me be on the show.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   Oh, it's been great to have you.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   Also, we're going to have another twin.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   The week that you're hearing this, there's going to be a great this week in media.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   I would definitely check out that we're talking about the digital versus film.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   We're going to hear Scott Brook on that in the upcoming week as well.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   I hope, right Scott, we're going to drag you back on there.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Yeah, I've been out of pocket just because I moved apartments and it took down my internet service.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   Now it's back up.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   Did you move to Brooklyn?
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   I did not move to Brooklyn.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   I'm sorry, I can't keep every Wells company in Brooklyn.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   This is a very inside running joke for those people who listened to Twim.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   If you listen to Twim, there's a little competition between the Manhattan folks and the Brooklyn folks.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   We just have to...
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   I migrated to the Upper West Side from the East Side, which is a huge ship, but I'm enjoying it over here.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   Very good.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   Daniel, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   Yeah, thanks for having us.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Daniel, where can people find more information about a lot of your stuff here?
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   My say is that roughly drafted that couple.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   I would highly check.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   It's roughly drafted.com.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   Really, really good stuff on there.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   If you're listening, I would definitely check out the website.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   It's really good stuff.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   That's Leo and I are both really excited about that.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   I am not going to be here for at least...
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   I might try to sneak in next week.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   We're going to see whether I can get up at like 3 o'clock in the morning for me, but probably not.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   I'm going to be in Zimbabwe.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   I'll be in Zimbabwe for the next two weeks.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   That's why we'll have Scott running the show here while I'm gone.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   I think Leo is on a cruise this week.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   Then next week I think he's at the following week.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   He's in Toronto doing call for help.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   I'm going to be down there hanging out with filmmakers, so I'll probably come back with lots of stories of stone sculptors using mac and tushes.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   That's the hip thing now.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   So anyway, thank you all and thank you to all the listeners.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   This is Alex Lindsey.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   I'm doing too many of these podcasts.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   I'm trying to remember which one is which.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   I don't have any good clothes, so I'm just going to say we're done.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   [Music]
