[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Andy Inaco is here. Jason Snell is here. Alex has taken the day off,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   but we've got a new contributor. I'm very excited to welcome Stephen Robles to our microphone. He is
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.600]   from Apple Insider. You've probably seen him on their podcast or seen him on their videos.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.680]   We have lots to talk about. Of course, the number one topic of conversation, we're only a week away
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.320]   from the next Apple event. What will Apple announce? Some new rumors breaking. We'll talk about those.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.960]   Also, what does the invite mean? You know, why that star field or is it an Alka seltzer? I'm not
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.440]   sure. And then the 162 page Apple repair manual, Jason Snell says he can do it. Can you? It's all
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   coming up next on Mac Break Weekly. Podcasts You Love From People You Trust
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.080]   This is Twigt.

[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.960]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news. The week before the Apple
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.400]   event. You could guess what the Apple news will be today. Jason Snell is here from Six Colors.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.680]   You've been spending too much time around Michael Sargent to do some singing.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.320]   He has the joining of the show. I blame him. You're absolutely right. Absolutely.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.800]   Yeah. Oh my god. He thinks he's Beyonce. And it's rubbing off.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.320]   It really does. It's contagious. So it's good. Great to be here.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.200]   You also do a show with Michael. You do clockwise.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.680]   Yeah. For a little while. Some are filling replacement. You have something else to come
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.800]   in with, Michael. But we'll talk about that in a second. Andy, not going to do.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.280]   It's also here. WJ. Beige in Boston. Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.680]   Hey, they're Heather. Are you trying to connect the sideburns now? Are they going to
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.960]   connect or is that their idea? No, no, no. I just didn't shake. Again, I do the pre-flight,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.040]   like half hour, basically, but half hour before the show to say, is there a disaster looming that
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.440]   I need to take care of or not? And unfortunately, I got an affirmative so I didn't shave this morning
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.520]   because like, okay, it looks like we're unplugging lots of stuff. I'm John Ashley.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.040]   Our technical director is zooming in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.840]   Got that, because I am fully aware. Thank you very much.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   Yeah. At least get me at least get my profile. I thought that maybe they'd come to life and they
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.400]   were deciding that they should join. Join up in the middle. No, no, they're their team player.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.960]   My brand is not always on my side, but the sideburns, they're always pulling with a team.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.080]   I'm very, very proud of them. And Alex Lindsey sent me an email last night.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.760]   Actually, he didn't send it to me, but he sent somebody at the station and email, said,
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.200]   I can't be there. But good news, because at the same time as he sent out that email,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.920]   I got an email from Stephen Robles, who is the guy behind audio and video at appleinsider.com.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.960]   And I thought, and let's not forget beard.fm. And I connect all the way.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   Here's a great opportunity to have Stephen on. So it's nice to meet you. Welcome to the show.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.120]   You as well. Thanks so much for having me. It's a pleasure. Yeah. And they said, well,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.920]   should we sound check him? And I said, Stephen is a professional podcaster. He will, he will be
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.240]   completely prepared. Ready at all times to podcast. Tell a good. So Mike, Stephen, if I, if I can
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.760]   just offer one bit of advice, you're going to regret having the besides the beers connect.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.440]   Because that way you get a land bridge for the mites on the left side of your head to you.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.920]   Like that's exactly how North America got colonized. It's plate tectonics beard wise.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.040]   Now it's like, it's a good beard. It's a good beard. And Jason and I are now now feeling very
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.160]   left out his website. He is the bearded teacher. Does a number of podcasts, including the apple
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.200]   and cider podcast. Also, by the way, a podcast about the home kit. So we make, we may prevail
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.560]   upon you for your home kit expertise, home kit insider and a podcast about movies. So I'm going
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.920]   to get you on with the vendor harder war of slash film. And we'll talk about movies on the side.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   Love to do. We could do a musical show as well as you started saying. Oh yeah, you're a trumpet
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.960]   player. One day more. I'll do a little lamest card. Oh Lord. Yeah, the musical theater in high school.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.360]   Another day, you know, the destiny. It's just in Mike, a sergeant is driving to the studio right
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.920]   down. So Mike, you said no, my crap. I'm sorry.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.720]   We can do the whole show right now. Mike was setting up to do a clockwise last week. Was that
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.040]   Wednesday? Yeah, Wednesday morning. And you were doing it with him. And did he squeal? Did he sing
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.680]   what happened? He was surprised in shock, I would say what it was. So basically the apple
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.520]   event notification went out and everybody was like, Oh, the apple event is going to happen. It's
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.040]   September 7th. It's the Wednesday after the Monday, which we, you know, it's obviously this is a thing
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.320]   that they've done before they did in 2016. So okay, that's great. And then and Micah then said,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.600]   Oh, mine says please come to Cooper's. Yeah. You made it.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.200]   Not just to Cooper Tina, by the way, to the Steve Jobs Steven Jobs, Steven Jobs theater.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.720]   Jobs theater. Yes. Yeah, you got that invite as well. I did. Yeah. So I'll be I'll be showing
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.760]   Mike at the ropes next week, I guess. Has he not been? No, this is the first he's the first timer.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.720]   Oh, wow. That's wonderful. I mean, he's great. And also I think that Apple,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.560]   because this is the first kind of all press event, I think maybe Apple tilted it to
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.280]   to the Bay Area a little bit more since Micah is local. That makes sense. It's a leisure.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.040]   You know, some people I know who are who are further out. I think Apple was understanding that
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.880]   maybe not everybody wants to come for a single day event from, you know, far away, if they were
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.480]   far out. Yeah, exactly. But I mean, I don't mean to say anything less about Mike. I just think that
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   that was all of us in the Bay Area here got a little advantage because they know that it's easy
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.880]   for us to drive down to the day. And I think that that was a big part of it too. Andy, were you
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   too far out there in your New England estate to get an invite? As a general rule, yes. Yes.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:55.520]   I think the days when I'm too old and too freelancing to say, yeah, let's spend $1,300 to attend a
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.800]   live stream event for like one afternoon and lose like three days of office work, like in the travel
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.840]   and all this sort of stuff. To watch a video, presumably, and then go and the hands-on area is
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.240]   very valuable and it's useful. But yeah, once you start thinking like, all I'm doing is sitting
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   watching the same video, everybody on the internet is watching at the same time, maybe a minute or
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.720]   two before they see it. And then you get the hands-on time. And that's valuable, but it's like,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.520]   it's not the same as a whole big, you know, lots of people milling around and you're seeing it in
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.120]   person for real. It's just a different thing. Stephen, you're going? Not going over covering it
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.760]   remotely. You know, we typically do like a little recap episode, but these recorded events, they go
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.240]   by so quickly, you know, so much information and such a short time on usually just scrambling the
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.480]   entire time taking notes, you know, they're very fast paced. Yeah, I think Jason Snell used to have
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.440]   to, I know Mike, he used to have to type. We have like three people typing at the same time,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.960]   didn't you, Jason? So horrible. Yeah, we had a before Google Docs, we used sub-ethad which was a
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.880]   Mac app that let you do everybody can be in the same document and we would do that and we would be
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.680]   live before there was live blogging, we would do these. Okay, let's back up Apple was like,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.640]   no live blogging at Apple events for a while people kind of honored that. And so what I ended
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   up doing instead of live blogging is what I called live reporting, which is basically,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.560]   I would write what was happening into that sub-ethad document and then later a Google Doc and then
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   somebody back at home base would turn that into a new story that updated minute by minute. So it
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.560]   technically wasn't a live blog, but at some point the damn burst and they didn't care anymore and
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.320]   then I went back to live blogging and live tweeting and it helps when you type fast for that sort of
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.560]   thing. This is from the days when Apple didn't stream it for a long time, Apple didn't stream it
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.200]   and so you had to be there. Once everybody could see it, it's a lot less necessary to do. Now these
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.520]   days I'll sort of tweet out the big headlines and some thoughts about it, but like everybody who,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.600]   well other than I do hear from people who watch it or who want to watch it better at work and the
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   videos are blocked. And so for them a blow by blow of what's going on is valuable, but for most
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.600]   people they can just watch it. Or if they really care, find out an hour afterwards by looking at
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.880]   all the people. Well, always. Yeah, of course. If you don't want to watch the baseball game,
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   you can just look at the box. I'm clicking. Michael, Micah is in South Petaluma. So maybe
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:16.240]   he was just just inside the cut off line because I'm in North Petaluma. I think they think you're
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:24.160]   too. Your brand has not invited as such a key part of it that they don't want to blow that up.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.400]   Part of the trademark. It's part of the trademark. Well, and actually I was very relieved that
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.720]   Micah was invited because it meant he was not tarnished by his association with me. So that's,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.040]   what did I sign up for here? Yeah, no, Stephen, it's okay. It's okay.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.800]   You're nervous. We still don't know. Although Renee Richie told me, he said,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   I can't tell you in public, but I'll tell you off the air why you're not invited. So I know he's
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   yet to do that, but supposedly he got the inside story. I don't care. It's actually just like you,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.320]   Stephen. I've got somebody's got to hold down the fort. It was going to be me and Micah. I guess
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.920]   maybe it'll just be me all by myself. I can't. I'm going to join you. What would you please?
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.160]   Let's plan on my joining you live this time. It's good because stop it. Don't show.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.920]   Go ahead. I'll shave before it. Fine. I'll shave. Oh, there you go. This is the last time I was at
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:26.880]   an event. That was the iPad announcement in 2010. Look, look to my right.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.960]   That was the editor in chief of PC Magazine. Michael Miller. Michael Miller. Yeah. In fact,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.720]   you probably could see a lot of famous people in that seat. The guy in front of me with the glasses
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.360]   and mustache looks familiar. Anyway, none of them were pointing a laptop at Steve Jobs introducing
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.560]   the iPad and streaming. I think you're in there with a chance. If they manage to lift the iron
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.880]   curtain between themselves and gizmodo, if they let gizmodo back in there, I think you're in the
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:02.080]   tweet. I thought, "Really, Apple? You're going to forgive them for buying the iPhone 4 from some
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.960]   guy who found an old car. You're going to do that, but you're not going to forgive whatever.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.760]   I always, this is a joke because I don't really care, but I always end up talking about this.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:21.280]   We will be doing the coverage live 10 a.m. Pacific. That's 1 p.m. Eastern time on the 7th,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:29.840]   which is a week from tomorrow. We were talking before the show about this, Jason.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.280]   I always a little conflicted about this. We do the Samsung event. We do Microsoft events
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.720]   because they're really just program length ads for a product.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.880]   Now more than ever. Especially the way Apple is producing these, they're so beautifully produced.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   They really are just like TV ads that go on. Yeah, it's an infomercial, essentially,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.520]   starring Tim Cook and Company. That's basically what it is.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.320]   The way you guys do it, you're laying your take on top of their commercial message.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.960]   I think that does provide a, you're not just rebroadcasting it. You're doing something
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.360]   transformative and providing commentary about what's going on. I think that there's value in that.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.640]   Although we don't stream it on YouTube because last time we did, which was a few years ago,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.560]   some Apple lawyer said us a note saying, "I actually took it down, I think."
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.840]   So we don't look for it on YouTube, but it might be on other places.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.760]   I was actually thinking of avoiding Paul Thoreau at the host of Windows Weekly.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.880]   He tweets his, "Narr, I think I might. Would you mind if he joins us?"
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:41.360]   Your show, I think that whoever we have, there needs to be a molari and a curly.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.080]   So you cast all those roles the way that you need them.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.840]   I don't know why you don't get invited, Leo. I don't understand it at all.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.480]   Paul would be great because he is kind of the,
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.960]   remember Devorak in the back of, was it Mac-World's Mac-user?
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.000]   Mac-user. Yeah.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.040]   Was it your magazine?
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.360]   Yeah, Andy and I were both fair. Yeah.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.920]   He did the anti-editor in the back.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.760]   Nobody wants a mouse.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.080]   And he's just a dumb color.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.480]   Hey.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   Yeah. He called the colorful Apple Mac book laptop.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.040]   He said, "It looks like a toilet seat cover, toilet seat."
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.000]   So the tea for a long time called it the toilet seat, Mac.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.400]   Yeah, I'll be that guy.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.080]   No, I guess Paul will be that guy.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   I will be Mo.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.400]   I think with your sideburns, you've got to be Larry.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.600]   Thank you.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.560]   And we'll let them.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:32.960]   No, no.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.240]   If I'm going to pick any of the three, I would, Larry, I think,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.520]   especially in the early shorts, he was like the anarchist.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.000]   He was the one that was about to overthrow the government
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.240]   if he weren't checked by a much stupider leadership.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.720]   So that's very much my brain.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.440]   I won't tell Paul that means he's curly.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.400]   He could be champ.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.080]   He might not mind being champ.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.720]   Curly Joe.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   It's not Curly Joe.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.560]   Not Curly Joe.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.160]   That was like the wrong Darren on Veewich.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.480]   All right.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   So tea leaf reading time.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.480]   Here is the picture.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.760]   And there are two ways to interpret this invite, the one that says far.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   Well, actually far out says something.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.880]   And then when you pair far out with a picture, show the picture,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.840]   if you would, John Ashley, this looks like something that James Webb telescope
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.640]   might have sent back.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.680]   In fact, they even look like galaxies, some of them are on the side and stuff.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.360]   It's either that or they're going to introduce the new Apple
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.560]   Alka-Celcer tablet, Apple-shaped.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.760]   Or maybe they're bragging about how bacteria freeze.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.360]   The Steve Jobs Theater is.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.320]   Yeah, look at it.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   That's the petri dish from last year now.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.280]   It's clean.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.320]   Nothing.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.000]   Well, there's a few stars inside.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.560]   Just a few.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.240]   Maybe my guess is that if it means anything,
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.760]   that maybe they're going to up the astrophotography features of the new iPhone camera.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.040]   Because I was surprised at how much I love the astrophotography on my pixel cameras.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.640]   Because it's something, "Okay, fine.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.920]   Great. It's a great demo.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.760]   It's going to you're going to get some headlines or some bullet items in your coverage that day."
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.160]   But then there comes that time where you're just happened to be outside and taking a
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.360]   picture of the beach.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.120]   I'm like, "Oh my God. It's full of stars."
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.960]   And it becomes one of those five features that you use maybe once a month, but the one time you
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.360]   use it per month, you don't even bother waiting.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.320]   You just send it right to Instagram or right to your group chat.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.240]   Google, of course, the Pixel 6.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.000]   And you have one has excellent astrophotography capabilities.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.840]   They touted it heavily last year.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.600]   But Apple will probably say, "Hey, we're the first."
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.640]   Stephen, what do you think this invite means?
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.240]   Yeah, I think a prevailing theory about a camera update.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.160]   48 megapixel has been a rumored--
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:40.480]   Right.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.160]   --might be the new camera on the iPhone, which first time since the iPhone 6S
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.120]   that has been updated has been 12 megapixels since the 6S.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.400]   So a 48 megapixel camera plus a astrophotography.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.560]   And lesser, there's the satellite and iPhone connectivity rumor.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.840]   It was rumors last year.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.760]   And now with T-Mobile and SpaceX kind of working together, those rumors heated up again.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.680]   But I think it's more in relation to the camera, for sure.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.840]   The Mingchi quote says it is the satellite.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.000]   He says that actually has been in the iPhone since iPhone 12, that capability.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.240]   But they haven't been able to get a partner.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.480]   His rumor was that Global Star will be the partner and that they will announce it on the 7th.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.840]   I do think that the fact that T-Mobile and Starlink announced this last week
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.320]   sounds to me like they're trying to get ahead of the Apple story.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.440]   Because T-Mobile said it won't be till the end of next year that you'll have this.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   Jason, what does satellite connectivity mean for users?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.400]   I mean, it's this whole idea that there are certain scenarios where you're somewhere where you can't
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.280]   get a signal.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.440]   And you see the story sometimes.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.320]   Somebody gets-- they turn on the wrong road and they're lost in the wilderness and the snow is
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.880]   coming down.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.280]   Or they're out on a hike and somebody falls or they get lost out in the wilderness
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.520]   and you don't have a cell signal and you can't call for help.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.000]   And can't tell people where you are.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.480]   Now, there's a chain of things here.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:08.800]   First is, any device I believe in the US and it might be worldwide that has a cellular
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.600]   radio on it.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.680]   If you don't have service but it sees another cellular site, you can call for help.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.800]   Like that's a thing.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.080]   It always says that.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.520]   In fact, if you take the SIM out, you can still make 9-1-1 calls.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.800]   So there's that.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.720]   But what if you're so far out that you can't get that?
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.760]   And the idea here is that there are companies that are or are about to offer satellite broadband
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.160]   coverage where on a certain frequency you can get probably-- it depends.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.800]   Like Starlink, they're talking about fairly high bandwidth.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.240]   For this stuff, the assumption is it's going to be really low bandwidth.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.080]   Like maybe you wouldn't even necessarily be able to make a voice call,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.040]   but you could send a text message that could get you to an emergency responder and say,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.640]   you know, either I'm in distress and here's where I am or the other feature they're talking
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.720]   about here is I've seen something like I just saw a boat sink or something and I'm out in the
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.840]   middle of the ocean.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.000]   I can send my GPS coordinates and say I'm reporting this thing that just happened.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.160]   So the idea there is that you're never truly entirely out of contact in case of an emergency.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.040]   I mean, in a long run, there's probably another conversation to be had about.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.520]   And this is sort of what T-Mobile is doing with SpaceX, which is the idea that when you're out of
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.480]   coverage or not out of coverage, because just as it steps down from like 5G to LTE,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.400]   you might get a situation where it steps down to satellite connectivity, which might not be as good,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.320]   but is covering the globe.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   And so you're never out of signal.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.440]   That's the whole idea.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.400]   But I think you're starting with emergency services, which is what the Apple story is probably about.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   In fact, T-Mobile says at some point they want you to be able to make phone calls, voice and data.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.880]   Yeah, that's the goal.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.560]   And SpaceX's second generation satellite should be able to provide that kind of bandwidth,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.520]   because they're trying to do this for home internet in places that are far off.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.040]   So you can get broad band-ish speeds from SpaceX's constellation.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:07.520]   But this global star Apple rumor is, I think, at least initially more about emergency
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.560]   messages to say help, I'm in distress.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.000]   Because again, you go back to those stories where somebody's out in the middle of nowhere
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.040]   and they've got their cell phone, but no service.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.560]   And even if they know where they are on a map, they can't tell anybody.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.720]   There could also be a story.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.520]   The Apple Watch Series 8 rumored for this event and a more rugged or pro model coming out.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.920]   Apple could tell a story of an adventurer kind of thing where you have satellite connectivity,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   where you can do at least do SOS text messages from your phone and pair that with your Series 8
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.720]   watch for adventurers, hikers out in the woods, kind of do a whole ad featuring those two features.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.440]   I could see that.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.320]   That exists now.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.600]   The Spot Watch, a lot of people hike in wilderness areas where emergency watches that do give them
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.320]   that kind of limited connectivity for emergency.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.960]   That's the sort of thing that gets me a little bit worried about these features.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.440]   There are, if you do a lot of hiking or if you're in a job that takes you into the wilderness that way,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.800]   you probably have a very inexpensive device that gives you these kind of features.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.160]   It's not a satellite phone, but it's a way to transmit your GPS coordinates and your situation
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.760]   to people in an emergency.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.800]   And by definition, people in those positions who went out and bought these specialized
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.720]   pieces of gear, they know that it's not because, "Hey, I can't find my car," or, "Hey, I need to know
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.840]   this, that, and the other." We already have people who call 911 because they call a fire department
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.720]   because they're out of gas and they're hoping the fire truck will bring them some gas.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.400]   I wonder what would happen if people get the wrong messaging about this and say, "No,
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.120]   this isn't for, hey, you're in a bit of hardship. This is the situation where you are going to
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.840]   die without help and you need that help desperately." And I wonder what would happen if
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:47.120]   this becomes a consumer feature built into every phone and prone to that 1% of people who are just
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.560]   absolutely flaming idiots.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.200]   I get that, but at the same time, this is a feature that's built into every phone in terms of the
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.240]   emergency SOS. And I don't recall hearing stories about it being misused that way, but
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.160]   I will defer, the fact is never underestimate the ability of people to be jackasses.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.720]   I mean, they will. They will.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:14.320]   All right, I'm going to tell you the weirdest rumor I read based on this invite far out.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:20.240]   I don't think this makes any sense. A periscope camera for the iPhone. We've seen these on other
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.400]   phones where it kind of rises up.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.000]   I don't know. By periscope camera, they don't mean rises.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.960]   Oh, they mean that.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.400]   Tell us internal power.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:28.880]   Yeah, internal power.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.040]   They mean that right exactly. That the lens is actually, it's actually mounted
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.520]   horizontally and it's actually firing through a prism prism.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Actually, I have been one of them as they were going to do that, right?
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.360]   And it's amazing.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.000]   I think the Mancicow reports as the 15 is going to do it next year.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.960]   Next year is probably the year. Like this will be, as Steven said, the biggest
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.560]   camera update that they probably done in years in almost a decade.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.720]   That's the kind of thing that drives sales, by the way.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.600]   I mean, I didn't move on the 13. I have the 12 and I thought it's incremental.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.520]   But if it's different audiences though, right? Because next year is probably when we're going
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.960]   to get a visual redesign and that drive for a lot of people, it's all about the looks.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.000]   How it looks.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.200]   But the periscope camera is also rumored for next year and that's really interesting because
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.720]   right, the optics, the physics change completely when you have longer distance for the light to
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.280]   travel. Andy, do you have a periscope phone?
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:28.080]   Yeah, yeah. This is the Pixel 6 Pro and that gives you like genuine 4X optical zoom.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:34.160]   And when you compare that, excuse me, when you combine that with Algorithmic Zoom,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.120]   which is Apple's Algorithmic Digital Zoom is just like Google's in that.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:46.720]   Those of us who have been growing up with phones saying no, never use Digital Zoom as just garbage,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.400]   the ability to interpolate between pixels is amazing.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.640]   And when you combine that with the 4X Zooms, it's just, it is a game changer.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.720]   It says what phone makers, including Apple, are really chasing after these days is ways to finally
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.440]   give users another one of those upgrades that says, wow, this is a breakthrough for me or this
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   is totally different than my camera before and my phone before. It's nice to have a faster CPU.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.640]   It's nice to have a faster refresh rate and better color on your screen.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.280]   But the first time that you're taking pictures of your kids playing soccer and suddenly you can
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.400]   zoom in and get great pictures of them like standing in goal, that's when people say,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.800]   oh my god, I didn't know that the new iPhone did that. I got to upgrade my phone right now.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:40.000]   I also have a periscope in my, this is the Galaxy S22 Ultra and actually this one goes to 100,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.440]   which is pretty wild. I took a few pictures with the optical, not the
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.640]   digital zoom, which I don't trust. Let me see if I have some pictures from Alaska where I wanted
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:02.720]   to try all three and zoom in. I'll see if I can quickly find an Instagram post I made earlier in
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.640]   the summer where the combination of the pixels at least optical plus digital zoom was there was
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:15.680]   just this dot on the horizon and it generated what I consider to be a very credible picture of
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:26.640]   two sailboats in the background. This is the one X, the basic, actually this is probably
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:34.960]   their wide, which they call 0.6, zooming into the one, I think this is the one X, this is the
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:41.840]   Marjorie Glacier in Alaska and I think this is the 10 X. So that's the same position,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.960]   the same zoom and it really is a high quality, I'll have Google fix the lighting because it
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.880]   looks a little bit dark, but it is a very high quality image, it's an optical zoom.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.960]   So that's pretty impressive, I have to say the ability to do that.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.480]   I just put the picture in the nuts far away.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.920]   Oh good, all right, let me look at, let me pull up your picture here.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:08.320]   That's the one thing about the 3X camera on the iPhone, every time I switch to it,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.200]   I immediately regret it almost. You really have to have really bright lighting outdoors,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.840]   and if you're at the beach maybe, but any other lighting condition, any kind of low light,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.240]   the 3X just really isn't very usable.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.960]   Here's your zoom, this is a 20 X digital zoom and you can see in the water some
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   digital kind of smearing.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.080]   Yeah, exactly, it's not perfect, this is 4X optical extended to 20 X.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.920]   For most people who are not trying to shoot the cover of Vogue, they're just what they
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.000]   want to get a snapshot of something that's happening too far away to get a good picture of.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.640]   And yeah, like Stephen said, that is one of the very, very few areas in which
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.320]   an iPhone camera doesn't look like it's holding up.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.360]   I'm really keen to see if the rumors of a 48 megapixel sensor are true,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.000]   whether they're going to give you access to larger than 12 megapixel images,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.680]   or whether it's going to be 40 megapixels, but it's been down to 12,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.120]   but that means that each pixel of resulting image is going to be basically 4x as much light,
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.680]   4x as much data, 4x as much resolution.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.960]   That is the thing that I'm most curious about because Apple likes to tell a story about everything,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.120]   but especially about cameras. And the rumor is it's a 48 megapixel sensor,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.440]   but they're probably going to be in it down to 12.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.080]   And they're going to talk about their algorithm and they're going to do all of that.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.360]   And they're going to say we don't need to do sweater mode anymore where we take five pictures
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.240]   and put them together. We can just take 48 and make some good decisions in our ISP that's on our
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.760]   amazing new chip and Blammo, a beautiful photo. But I also wonder, Andy, there are other things
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:47.600]   you can do with a 48 megapixel sensor. You can do some smart things. So your quote unquote digital
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:54.320]   zoom is more than a digital zoom because you're able to potentially use more pixels on the sensor
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.360]   by zooming in and using that, right? Do they enable that? Do they do some image stabilization
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.160]   that's clever? There are so many other things they could do because it has been a Steven set
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   at 12 megapixel sensor for so long. And I'm really curious about what they're going to push
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.120]   in terms of going to the bigger sensor because there's a lot of stuff they could
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.280]   sell on that and build in with software. But there's no guarantee about any of it.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.520]   That's where they can get creative. And that's what we don't know, right? Because we know the
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.160]   rumor about the sensor is probably true. But what is the software that enables it? And that's still
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.640]   a mystery. Yeah, and Apple does so many clever things that way. They could do things like,
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.760]   yes, you're shooting it. You're shooting like a 4k or an HD video, but unbeknownst to you,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.040]   the camera is also looking to see where your kid is going off frame and making sure that wherever
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.360]   they are off frame, the autofocus will be ready to adjust because they're moving kind of towards
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.640]   the towards the picture towards the towards the camera and the focus could get lost. Or something
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:59.680]   as simple as we've seen in FaceTime, the ability to simply track track heads movement and do a fake
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:05.200]   pan zoom. But imagine being that good. Even when again, you're taking pictures of your little kid
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.840]   who's running around. And if you just if you just basically already tapped on the kid's head and
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.720]   say, please track this this individual, the ability to, yes, you're doing a bad job of following the
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.920]   kid around. But the the actual software is actually capturing where where that kid is,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.760]   not necessarily where they are inside the frame that you can see. It's with Apple, it's always
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.520]   really, really exciting to see how they do do this stuff. They're they're the anti Samsung.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.960]   Samsung would say, we have the first 100 megapixel camera. Apple will say, we have a camera that
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.200]   we can that will actually let you keep up with your three year old child. Right. And they'll also
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.720]   say that the A16 chip, which presumably will be in the that camera will have an image signal
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.360]   processor that's specifically designed to do all the things they wanted to do. And the neural
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.280]   engine is going to be specifically tasked to the machine learning of the image analysis.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.720]   Right. Like they'll tell that whole story, but they're good at that. That is one of the things
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.480]   that's Apple's strategy with with the iPhone camera has always been really interesting, right?
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.960]   Because they don't necessarily change chase the numbers, but they're very proud of what they can
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.360]   do in terms of their processing. And so that when they when they make a leap like this with a raw
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.800]   megapixel number, it's really interesting to wonder like, how do they spin that? How what
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.560]   what did they decide to do with all those megapixels? And that's what I'm looking for.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.400]   Do maybe the most, I think, on the seventh.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:25.200]   This is a rumor that the A16 is only going to be on the iPhone 14 pro model. And so if there's
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.000]   40 megapixel cameras, the standout feature for the pro and only that gets the A16, I'm curious
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.160]   what the story will be then for the regular 14. There's going to be a larger size,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   supposedly, so you can get a bigger screen, but not sure what other hardware updates that could
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.040]   come to it. That's an interesting question. I think it's widely accepted that there'll be two
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:49.520]   different chips. There'll be the A15 in the two bottom line of the line phones. And then the two
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.840]   top lines, the pros will have the A16. I don't know if that's going to make a huge difference.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.760]   There is a display coming to the pro supposedly probably have to do with that chip and power
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:06.160]   saving and all that. Yeah, good point. I had a bigger size, right? 6.7 inches for the two pro
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.040]   for the well, wait a minute. No, I take it back. There'll be two 6.7 inch phones, one pro max,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:20.160]   and then one not pro max. This is all rumor. I'm sorry, Jason Snow, but you knew this.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:26.800]   No, many. No, many. No, it breaks my heart. The amazing thing is we've had these rumors for
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.920]   like 15 months now. This is what was going to happen. This has been in process for a very long
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.520]   time. Now we finally reach the end. Is it that we're wrong and that we're going to have a big
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.960]   surprise on Wednesday? The track record of the supply chain analyst being she quotes,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.720]   is very, very good. Mark Gurman, who has a very good track record at Bloomberg,
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.000]   he also says that this is what's going to happen. I feel like there are not going to be surprises.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.320]   You got to take the surprises where you can get them, right? That's why I'm so excited about
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   how they're going to sell the camera story, right? Because we know the specs of what it will
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.600]   probably be the camera, but we don't know the details. We don't know how Apple has spun it and
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.440]   put it all together in the way that they do. That's marketing and it's also high level software
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.040]   and chip strategy that doesn't leak because the people are like, look, they made a chip.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.120]   And it's like, okay, that doesn't tell us anything. I do wonder, by the way, about the chip marketing,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.600]   how it is a real great question that Stephen asked there, which is how do you market a new
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.280]   iPhone, the base model that has the same chip as last year's model if they do that? What do you
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   do to differentiate it? That's a hard thing. Sometimes I wonder if what they ought to do is
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.200]   sort of like brand, like if they made any changes at all to the chip from last year to this year,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.480]   branded as the new one and then call the high end one like the A16X or something like that to
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.840]   differentiate it. But you guys are all going to call them on that the minute they do that.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.960]   If it's exactly the same, but if it's like a new process or something, but you're right,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   exactly if we're like, oh, but it's really just the same. So, okay, fair enough then,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.200]   how do you sell a new phone with the old chip in it? That'll be something to say.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.920]   They'll probably do a huge segment on iOS 16 again, talking about the Apple and 14.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.840]   I mean, they usually do that anyway because iOS 16 is coming out, but that larger size is
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.600]   going to attract, I think, a large audience, people that want a bigger screen or don't care about
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.680]   promotion and any other things. And as far as accuracy of the mini versus the regular,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.360]   the last couple of years, one of the most accurate leaks has been the models that come out.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.280]   And you'll see these leakers actually get like the actual models or whatever they are like clay
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.760]   versions. And we did get the 13 mini last year as one of those models. But this year,
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:31.680]   there was definitely no mini size and there was the two smaller iPhone 14 and then 14 plus.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.280]   So here's the tell because when you go to the Apple store right now, right there in the specs
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:44.800]   is a 15 bionic. And so they make that processor a big part of what they're selling. If that
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:52.240]   disappears in the iPhone 14 descriptions, if they don't mention the processors, that's the tell.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.640]   There's stuff they can bring back, right? So there is enough differentiation between the
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.320]   iPhone and the iPhone Pro at this point that there are things that they can bring back to the
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.800]   iPhone standard, even while leaving the chip the same. But that's going to be the question is,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.280]   do they pull back another camera? That's a big question. Or do they pull back the LiDAR sensor?
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.600]   Does anybody care about that? Or promotion, they could bring, they could put the promotion
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.720]   display on the lower end model if they wanted to. But like, lacking that, it's going to be weird,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.000]   right? Because what what's new, if nothing's new? So there's going to be something that has to be
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.160]   new there other than just iOS 16, right? There has to be something else. Well, you know who cares
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.600]   about the LiDAR sensor is Apple. You, and users may not, but if Apple's going to continue to promote
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.760]   its AR capabilities, they know it doesn't, it doesn't, it's not going to say, Oh man, I got to get
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:46.160]   that iPhone with the LiDAR. No, no one's going to do that. Well, one of the leaks this morning was
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.320]   possibly a new MagSafe accessory coming out of this event. And that could be something where we
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.480]   haven't heard a lot about MagSafe in the last two years, you know, came out with the iPhone 12.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.960]   And so if they have a new accessory or possibly a new feature like reverse charging for AirPods
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.880]   coming to the iPhone 14 lineup, that could be something they throw to the lower end iPhones,
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.920]   as well as the pros. So I would like to see more MagSafe stuff anyway.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:15.120]   I don't know how credible this LiDAR in China is. U1122. Apple insider has the story. He says,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:21.440]   according to the LiDAR change in MagSafe, quote, MagSafe magnetic force is stronger. MagSafe
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   exclusive battery accessory has been added. I've seen other rumors that say it's huge.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.080]   It's really big. This is actually an interesting, you know, this is the silly season where you're
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:40.480]   going to have people make stuff up. He says, I don't know how accurate he has been. The storage
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.920]   space is the same as that of the iPhone 13 series. I had heard some rumors say that they're going to
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.760]   justify the higher price, because that's the other rumors that the prices are going to go higher,
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:58.400]   by more storage. This guy says, expect some surprises in the pricing.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.720]   Prices may be in a completely different direction than expected.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:13.120]   Wow. He claims this information is coming from pre-release pre-production testers.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.400]   But then Apple insider quite rightly says, well, why would they have pricing?
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   They wouldn't have pricing. Maybe that costs some doubt on all of this.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:31.040]   It will be interesting if there's a larger regular iPhone 14, how that stacks in the pricing model.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.600]   Is there going to be an iPhone 14 plus that's more expensive than the 14 Pro,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.360]   or will they move some of the prices down to make more sense?
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:45.600]   I mean, there's room above it, right, because the iPhone 13 line starts at $6.99, but that's
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:52.480]   the mini. It really starts at $7.99. There's room there at $8.99 for an iPhone 13 Max,
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.160]   or Plus, or whatever you want to call it. I will say this about that pricing rumor.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.040]   There was a report from, I think, being Chico who said that they wanted the average selling price of
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.520]   the iPhone to go up 10% this year. There's no way to do that with mix. There's no way to do that
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.760]   and say, well, the mini's out and we're selling more of the iPhone Max and Pro Max. We're going to
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.880]   make it up. You've got to raise prices somewhere to do that. But I think the thing that gives me
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.520]   pause about that story you just mentioned, Leo, is that it mentions surprises with price.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:30.880]   Losing $6.99 as the entry point for the iPhone will be a little bit painful for Apple.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.160]   So I wonder if the iPhone that won't have the S-E still, right?
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.920]   Sure, sure. But when you have your new phone, I mean, you go to that iPhone page and it's like
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:48.560]   iPhone 13 starting at $6.99. And if they have to say $7.99, it hurts a little bit. So I wonder
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:53.280]   if what this is all getting at, and I'm just spitballing here, but I wonder if one of the options on
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:00.000]   the table for Apple is to take their base model, the iPhone 14 or 15 or 16 or whatever it is.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.240]   What is it this time? I've lost track now. It's a 14. It's a 16. Well, only if they can count.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:12.000]   But iOS 16, but I think there was no 9. So we got to change these numbers. So imagine,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.280]   just follow me here for a second. What if they lower the price on that one? What if that one starts
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   with a cut rate that is $7.49 or something like that? So they can say that the iPhone starts at a
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:31.440]   low price while at the same time introducing a new higher priced iPhone, Max or Plus, and potentially
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.080]   even raising the prices of the Pro models. That would be one way to get the line to seem
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:41.200]   affordable, but actually be more stretch the price gamut because you're right. They always talk about
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:47.680]   starting at and they know that's the number that you're going to see and that needs to be a low number.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.360]   You don't think they'll bite the bullet and just say everything's 100 bucks more.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.480]   I mean, I think that's the most obvious solution is for them to just raise the prices on everything.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.960]   But if they and like I said, I would be surprised if they go home. I mean, you know,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.400]   but they could play that trick where they have a base model with low storage configuration
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   that doesn't satisfy almost anybody, but it allows them to say it starts at $6.99 or $7.49.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.360]   I could see them doing that for the psychological trick. And the SE doesn't do it because everybody
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.720]   knows that's really that's the fun you want. That's, you know, I can see and I can believe it because
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.480]   there's one area in which Apple, I think engineering wise can't innovate and they can't compete. They
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:36.000]   cannot make a $500 phone that is that is a patch on Samsung and Google's like $500 phones. It's like,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.480]   I just don't think that they've cultivated the knowledge of here's what we can sacrifice. Here's
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.320]   the efficiency is we can make. Here's how we can deliver a $500 phone or even a $350 $400 phone
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:52.080]   that almost every user who walks into a phone store in America is going to say, Oh my God,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.240]   this is great. This is wonderful. This is everything that I want. And I get to walk out of here with
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.320]   a little bit more money in my pocket or without having to extend my bill a little bit more than
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.800]   that. So I could definitely and also the people who come in for iPhones, they come in for iPhones. I
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.400]   mean, Samsung is competing with OnePlus. They're competing with Motorola. They're competing with
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:17.680]   every other maker of a really good $300 to $500 phone. I really think that Apple is really only
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.560]   competing with whatever they sold this person the last time and whether they can deliver something
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:28.160]   that really seems to be worth putting another seven, eight and nine nine hundred God forbid $1,400
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.800]   into new hardware. We've always said that Apple doesn't want to make a low-cost phone,
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.760]   but that's I guess proven untrue by the SE. But they like being in the luxury market.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:44.240]   How much does China impact this iPhones now make up half of all premium smartphones sold in China?
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:52.720]   They finally surpassed the local Chinese manufacturers. China is important to Apple.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.040]   Jason, you do the color graphs.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.720]   Yeah, I mean, it is an important market for them. It's not just for manufacturing. It's also for
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:06.320]   selling into their very much growing middle class. They have a middle class that is a potential
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.560]   iPhone target market that's like the size of the entire US population and growing.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:17.040]   And that's all good for them. And they do have success getting new people. It is an untapped
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.120]   market for them in a lot of ways where there are still a lot of new iPhone buyers and new to
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.360]   Mac buyers coming into the Chinese market. I will say that there is at least this
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:32.240]   tendency to view the Chinese market as being driven by design changes. So the idea being that
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.040]   that is one market where the brand new look really drives sales, which would be next year,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.240]   potentially. Because it's a status. You're three of this design.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.720]   That is, has Apple ever gone three years of the same design before?
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:51.280]   Yeah. You can always, 6, 6, 7, was pretty similar on the side of the
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.200]   Anabands on the outside. It was pretty same body style.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.640]   So it hasn't always been that TikTok thing where you do two years, then you update the design.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:08.080]   And arguably what the 10s and then the 11 pro was kind of the same design. And then they
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:13.760]   ticked over into the 12, 13, 14. So yeah, I think this is, I think they've stretched out. As they'd
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.520]   added models, they've also sort of stretched out the design window for their generations.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:25.840]   According to the now discredited report, the iPhone for it. No, it's not. We'll come in green
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:32.960]   purple. I saw that purple. I don't know. Blue, black, white and red. That's the regular one.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:38.240]   The pro will come in green, purple, silver, gold, and graphite. Of course, silver, gold,
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:44.800]   and graphite always have been premium colors. The poor people like purple and green and blue.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:54.000]   I also heard a red, a red this year. Product red. Well, no, they said a new red, a new design red.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.080]   But these are, this is the silly season. Everything, all bets are off this week.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   Although I will just to be fair, rumors get a little bit more interesting in the couple of
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.800]   weeks before the actual announcement because this is the, this, now we open now Apple has to open
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.000]   the gates to a lot of people that they absolutely would not trust with any information until they
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.960]   absolutely have to read things to this. This is when you start to see leaks from people who
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:28.080]   have access to whatever the display ad is going to be on a carrier's local website in a few days
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.440]   time. So this is the time where if I hear something really ridiculous, like five days beforehand,
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.680]   I will still acknowledge that it's ridiculous, but it's different. It's a different rumor than
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.960]   something that would come five months before release where nobody has, nobody who has access to
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:48.880]   something that surprising would risk their job and their, their subcontractor companies contract
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:56.080]   with Apple by letting that go. Today's rumor also said that Apple had a titanium version of the
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:02.720]   phone but decided not to release it because of cost. Yeah, what, what's good is titanium either.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:09.440]   It's strong like tenant problems. Yeah, but yeah, and tenant problems plus you also
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.920]   it's already strong. It's already light. And I don't think people, I think that it's a, it's a
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.640]   big, it's one of those, but it's one of those names in a product description that makes watch
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.200]   buyers eyes light up as, oh, this is super premium. Look at titanium case, but I don't think that
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.160]   it really is going to affect phone buyers. It does solve a problem of Apple's own making,
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.400]   ironically, which is their insistence on having that stainless steel on the pro phone, which
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.720]   is a look that I actually think the pro phones have looked worse than the regular phones for
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.600]   this entire design cycle. I think the design of the other of the standard phones is more colorful.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.440]   It's more interesting. The amodized aluminum looks great. And they're like, no, no, surgical stainless
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:53.920]   steel. And that, that is heavy. So you could then solve that problem by having it be a titanium ring.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.520]   Instead, it's premium materials. I can see what they were thinking there, but like Dandy's point,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.000]   it's not that it doesn't solve a problem. It's that it solves a dumb problem that didn't need to
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.400]   be there in the first place, but still I could see. Yeah, that's, that's, yeah, that seemed like a
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.640]   real stretch, right? Because then you're like, or you could buy the iPhone edition for, for 17,
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   19, 19, it's like, I don't know. I want a gold iPhone. Also, I don't, I don't, I don't want a phone
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.400]   in a case, but almost everybody puts their phone in their case anyway. And then see any of this stuff.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.920]   Yeah, I have, I forget, I had a purple and a blue phone, but I forgot because it's been in cases
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:37.200]   since I bought them. So I take them out and I go, Oh, that's pretty. I haven't seen that in a while.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:43.040]   So I don't know. But yes, Stephen, the service, I wonder why I wonder where they're going to be.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.400]   Ceramic. They're going to be ceramic. That's, that's interesting. It also means,
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.480]   also means they can do different things with coloration, different things with the engineering
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.000]   of the material that is, is even a ceramic transparent to antennas. Yes, right? It's not metal.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.160]   Yeah. Well, the series five Apple watch was ceramic. Right. And that was the last time we saw
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.640]   that material. So there's been lots of people wanting it back because it's been three, four years.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.160]   So I would like to see it. I kind of missed my chance for a ceramic one. I have the titanium,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.200]   which I do like, but I'd like to go for ceramic. You got to be foolish to buy. And I'm foolish.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.360]   So I, I'm in the same group, but you got to be foolish to buy a device that you're going to
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:23.200]   have to upgrade in a year in a premium material. Like any, anybody who's really smart was going to
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.640]   buy aluminum, right? Although I will say the Sapphire watch face as opposed to the high
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:34.720]   on X glass on the aluminum. It is more durable. And I got my wife, an aluminum model Apple watch
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.120]   first. She hit it against the kitchen counter the next day and that screen had a crack. And so,
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.120]   switched to the Sapphire stainless steel and the, at least the display is more durable,
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.520]   even if the finish is not your, your young, I'll give you some advice as an old bearman.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.360]   Never give your wife the lesser watch. Very true. You always give her the better.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:00.720]   I was track one. You gave me aluminum. What are you? She we don't know if it was an accident.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.360]   It may well have been. Yeah. I'll take this. I'll take you here. I'll give you your aluminum
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:12.640]   Apple watch. Yeah. So this is the, to me, this is maybe more interesting, even though what's
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:19.360]   going to happen with the iPhone, there's a pro model watch coming out, right? There are sport
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   watch. Yeah. I'm, it's supposedly larger, even larger display than last year. So it'll be very big.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.240]   Also premium materials. Honestly, I'm interested to see what story Apple tells because the increase
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.640]   of display slides last year, and maybe the same story this year, but usually a health sensor is
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.440]   usually part of the mix in what Apple announces. Some rumors about a temperature sensor, which,
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.680]   you know, during COVID and then even now maybe it'd be valuable to know if the temperature rises or
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.720]   falls, accuracy notwithstanding, but curious the health implications of whatever comes in the series
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:56.560]   right? Yeah. Yeah. Name. Do we have a name? Go ahead. The name is the real thing. So I was talking
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.880]   on my podcast, I do with Mike Hurley upgrade. We were talking about this and we talked ourselves
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:05.920]   into this idea, which is like, we're like, what's the name? Is it Max? Is it Pro? Is it extreme?
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.360]   And I had this moment where I thought, what if there isn't a name? What if it literally is just
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:14.160]   a third size of Apple watch? And it's all series eight. And it's just that comes in three sizes now,
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.560]   essentially small, medium and large. I don't know if they'll do that because the rumors are
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.680]   that they may differentiate this thing in terms of features. But it's also possible that the only
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.920]   thing that's different about it is that it's got a bigger screen, bigger battery. And if that's the
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:33.040]   case, I mean, the rumors are that it might be differentiated in terms of only being available
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:39.120]   in the high end material in like titanium. But that's not, you know, maybe, maybe not.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.400]   But it's in front of you. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.240]   Yeah. What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your, what comes with sour cream and guacamole
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:52.960]   and we have a burrito. We have a series eight grand day. We have a macho burrito here at our
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.240]   regular, regular Mexican restaurant, which is as big as your head. I mean, there are rumors about
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.560]   it being kind of sporty. And I can see a story that they could tell there. We talked about the
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:09.680]   satellite emergency stuff. I could see a, a friend of mine, David Smith took a, an Apple watch on
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.160]   a mountaineering trip, basically. And, um, you know, you can't manage the battery on that thing. And I
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.360]   wonder like, you could tell a software story where you're like, well, this battery is big enough that
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.600]   we can put it in like a low power mode that's, that is still useful and will still track your
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:29.280]   workouts and locations, but is not going to run out of battery in a day and it'll last for three or
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.400]   four days or something like that. Like they could do that. Or, which I think is the simpler version
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:40.720]   of the story is it could just be a bigger watch with battery and cost more. That's it.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:46.080]   Couldn't do worse than edition. That was a terrible name. That really said nothing at all.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.640]   They, they, they really ran the table on bad decisions on that. Yeah. That was John.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:56.080]   Yeah. I blame Johnny. But that, but I, I'm still fascinated by the possibilities, like,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.480]   like Jason, about all the different things I could do with it. I do think that I really would love
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:06.000]   to see Apple really try to do a more ruggedized version of that watch. It would fit in so well
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.080]   with the messaging that there's, that they're saying with this that it's, it's not every,
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   it's the activity watches for the people who are getting out there and using their bodies.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.840]   And not all of the things that you do involve like being, being, being, doing mindful yoga
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:26.320]   exercises and stretches. A lot of it involves being in a kayak that's being pushed towards a rock face
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.640]   by the elements of nature that do not want you here in this canyon. And you're very, very curious
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.840]   whether or not you will survive, let alone your, your fancy $400 watch. And, and because it would
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.440]   not, it would not only, as a practical thing, it would not only be a practical feature,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.480]   it would appeal to the person who is again, going off, even the person's, when they're going out
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.800]   for beers, like on a, on a Wednesday night, that no, no, I don't, this person doesn't have like
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.200]   the Apple watch. They have the ruggedized version of it because man, that's how hard this, this
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.560]   person pulls. Yeah, that's what it appeals to. Just exactly as you said a while ago, Jason,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   that the best phone, the best selling phone is the one with a new design. The best-selling
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.640]   watch will be one new design. You don't, it's the same reason you see downtown San Francisco
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:14.240]   filled with four by fours. They're not going off road. But yeah, it looks, you look pretty macho
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:19.120]   driving that around, you know. It's a lifestyle choice. And a lot of Apple is a lifestyle brand,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.360]   that's part of it. And I think the new stuff, yeah, there, there is the bit, if there's a big,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:29.760]   awesome max, max watch, right? Like whatever they call it, it will get adherence. It will
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.600]   absolutely do that. There'll be people who prioritize the battery and the people who just be like,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.240]   I'm a big guy with a big arm and I'm going to put a big watch on it. And I need to watch with
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.880]   exposed screws that tears the, tears the flesh out of my wrist. It's so rugged. Well, no,
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.960]   that's the G shock, right? I mean, how many people bought G shocks that were really jumping out of
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:52.160]   airplanes or yeah? Well, well, okay, I will say that I've had the one watch that I've had that
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.400]   is never, that has always worked for me has been the G shock that I bought 12 years ago,
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:03.280]   because this damn thing, it will not be destroyed for anything. And I've had, I've had misadventures
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:09.520]   just just being just being me not being action Jackson out there, where suddenly the screen breaks
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.760]   or suddenly there is a crack somewhere, or there's water infiltration because I got caught in the
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.320]   wrong place the wrong time with the wrong weather. And I'll be damned. This is, and this, the thing
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.200]   is when you have that as part of your, my, I only have like three watches, maybe four watches,
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.040]   but when you have a ruggedized watch as part of your collection, if I'm going to be gone for
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.680]   two weeks, I'm to I'm wearing the G shock. If I'm going to the beach, am I having fun? If I'm,
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.880]   if I'm doing anything that's really, really active, I'm wearing the G shock. So that's,
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:42.000]   it's not necessarily the adventurer is person is the one who they don't, they, hey, this new
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.360]   Apple Silicon is great. All these great. So that's great. You should be really proud of it. It's
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.160]   great. But sometimes you just want to watch that will continue to be a watch for as long as you're
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.280]   away from a store and away from your home. And I think that the G shock fills that, fills that
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.000]   void. And I think that there will, there might even be people like me who are not kayaking towards
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.920]   bare clip faces who would say that if I'm going to use this for three or four years,
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.800]   I don't want to, I don't want to have to worry about, Oh, I got caught in a downpour or oh, I fell
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:16.160]   off this, I fell off this boat or I fell off this and got this thing wet. I would, I would even
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:22.000]   consider spending an extra like $80 if it had that kind of G shock sort of promise of this is
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.400]   going to be the hardest thing to, to destroy. They will, they will find, they will find this watch
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:32.800]   before they find your body that kind of ad copy, you know, there is one rumor that scares me that
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:40.880]   whatever they call it, the macho grande watch will not use the same watch bands.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:45.600]   I have a lot of solo braided loops that are going to be up for sale.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.520]   I really love them. I know, but I love the solo loops I went all in on.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.880]   Oh, they're nice. Yeah. They're nice. How many bands do you have, Steven?
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.040]   I wish I could, I should run and get them. I'm going to go between like a dozen and
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.600]   15 out of me. So nobody competes with Renee Richie in that category. No, no, no, he's not
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:11.360]   close. The maximum amount. It's not a problem. It's, it's not any time he wants. I just point out
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.800]   that apples never maintain size compatibility, right? Like all of the small watch bands are
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.760]   compatible and all of the, yes, what is now the large watch bands are compatible. So not very
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.840]   surprising if they do an even larger slice, it would have its own compatibility level.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.520]   Oh, breaks my heart though. I don't think it's, I mean, yes, everybody who's invested heavily in
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:36.880]   watch bands will have to think before they leap to this super big. But maybe it's time for a change.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.280]   Maybe it's time for something. Is that a deal breaker for you, Steven?
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.640]   No, I mean, I also saw a rumor. Maybe it, they will fit like they will actually work with a new
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.400]   Apple watch, but it just won't look like it's supposed to. You might be just kind of weird.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.360]   Skinny band on that giant watch.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.920]   Yeah, but silver metal insert on a black watch.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.960]   Now we're talking about dongles for watch bands for Apple watches. That could be no more perfect
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.080]   out of the industry. I have an adapter I use.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:11.440]   But I was like, I could imagine, you know, if there's an Apple watch series eight,
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:16.080]   but there's a 45 millimeter size, just like the series seven, your bands will fit. But now if
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.320]   there's a 48 millimeter or 50 millimeter size, then you have to buy a new band for that,
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:24.640]   just like you would if you went from a 42 to 44 millimeter or something like that.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.840]   I guess it's not surprising and it's not awful, but gosh, I have a whole drawer full of those.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.800]   That'd be sad. I will say that kind of wish that they would upgrade the stock,
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.280]   plastic band, plastic slash, whatever they're saying instead of plastic.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.320]   Last summer. Exactly. Do it in the accident, though, which is the actually a
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:44.720]   rough.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.360]   Last summer.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:45.840]   Flow.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.360]   Yeah, fluoro elastima.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.160]   Yeah, it's really more.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.040]   Because rubber, I think.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   It's cool. It was very, very different. But the thing is like there are people who are
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.240]   exercising with this thing on. They're swimming. They're doing active stuff.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:05.760]   And that thing fails so much. It's like YouTube started recommending recreational divers who
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.160]   dive underneath who dive in places where people are boating and swimming.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.520]   They'll come up with fistfuls of like, hey, I found eight phones. Hey, look, I found this ring.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.640]   And every time they find an Apple Watch, it has that exact same band on it.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:24.960]   The thing, the thing, and people who do certain sports with it, do affirm that that thing,
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.040]   when you hit the water, it has a way of getting undone and then falling off your wrist.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.760]   I think it might be time for a different type of buckle on that.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.560]   Even the solo loops, or is that just like the one that has the buckle clasp mechanism?
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.760]   It's the kind of what they're calling it. But the kind that has, it's just wraps around.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.600]   There's a stud that locks into a hole, right? That's the sport.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.800]   And I did have that problem when I, whenever I'm testing, sometimes I'll be,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:54.480]   it doesn't come off, but I'll notice that something flexed. And now the stud is no longer
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.280]   engaged in the hole. It's still holding on fine, but it's not, it's basically being held on by,
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:04.320]   you know, rubber against sweaty skin and whatever tension is on the, is on the band.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.800]   So I could see how, if you're, I could see how you're walking around for the rest of the day,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.920]   not knowing that this, this cuff is not fully engaged. And then when you realize that at some
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.720]   point I lost my Apple Watch, it's two hours later, not that it fell. It's just that it dropped off
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.080]   at some point and you never noticed. One of some solo loops you can buy off me.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:28.880]   Slightly used solo loops. I didn't, the only reason I never bought a solo loop is because I
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.320]   wasn't sure about the sizing and I didn't want to get the wrong size. I guess I could go into a
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:40.160]   store and I got a wrong size. There's that map. There's like a map on the internet that you can
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.240]   get. John Gruber posted at some point, you can actually see which dot on the sport band.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:51.280]   Oh, yeah. And map that. Oh, brilliant. So it works. Oh, the third party opportunity.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.240]   We're actually speaking of third party opportunities and I'm not, they are sponsored,
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.680]   but I'm going to give them a play. I mean, Nomad has a new sport loop that has a different,
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.120]   kind of like a big square stud instead. So I hear anti typing.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:13.520]   That is the G-Shock sport band. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It looks more like a tank.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:18.640]   Good. Oh, I'm so happy about it. I got Apple by the way.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.480]   Sorry again. Singing. The tool that Jason was talking about is from Apple. Like you can actually,
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:27.040]   you're going to buy a band. There's actually a PDF you can download, print it out, and then
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.440]   you cut out this paper. Yeah. No, no, I don't want a tape measure. I never trusted that.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.720]   And you got it wrong, right? The first one was wrong. I want the thing that says,
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:41.840]   where's the hole on your sport band? So Gruber and I put a link in our chat on
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.920]   Daring fireball. He actually has a thing with pictures where it shows sport bands lined up
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:52.080]   against Apple sizing chart. And I mean, it's not 100%, but I used this to find my size and it
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   worked fine. This is the idea of like, where do you, what hole do you put the little, little
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:02.640]   nubbin through on the sport band? And what does that mean in terms of what size it is for you?
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.640]   Yeah, see, I don't want to, yeah. What hole do you put your nubbin through?
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.240]   Where should I put my nubbin? That's right. What color is your nubbin?
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:17.520]   It turns out sport band holes according to Gruber, this is two years old, but I finally,
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:24.080]   thanks to you, I'm seeing it do map exactly to the solo loop sizes. So you could just figure out
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.440]   which is which. Yeah, using the large of the small and then, and then figure it out. So I use
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:36.320]   the small and I'm on, on, you know, hole number four. So that being size four, I've always wanted
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:42.720]   a solo loop and I've always been too afraid to count one. I have, I have small phobias.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:46.880]   Or and be sure to use the photo, actually be sure to use the photo for your, the photo for your
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:52.240]   size. Because I said that wrong. I am, I am a nubbin number four. So I'm a size six and I am a size
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:57.840]   six. That works for me at the sport loop. Okay. Yeah, but don't buy it yet, Leah, wait until
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.240]   you wait. I'm going to wait. New bands, but I do like those solo. Do you like the solo
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.280]   loops? Steven, they're nice. They're comfy, right? Oh, I love. Yeah, I'm wearing one right now.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.480]   This is the, the lemme. Oh, I have pretty that looks. And there's no buckle. So there's,
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.200]   it's just not going to fall off. Yeah. And so I do all the braided solo and the floor last
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.360]   summer solo loops. I love them. Yeah. They get, they get a little relaxed over time. I find that
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:23.200]   after about a year, they're a little janky. That's why I get them a little tight. I get them a little
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:28.160]   tight at first. And then they get comfortable a few months later. Apparently, according to the
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:34.560]   Encyclopedia Britannica, fluoro elastomer polymers are swollen by ketones and ethers
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.120]   attacked by steam and become glassy at temperatures not far below room temperature.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.480]   So be careful with it's the same. It's the same chemical as in Teflon.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   Did you know that? I don't know. It sounds like it's like a game of thrones happening at a molecular
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:56.640]   level. Yeah. I was waiting for the end, which is, you know, they, they lay a thousand fluoro elastomer
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.480]   eggs, but only a few dozen make it to the sea. Just be where winter is coming. Uh,
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:10.800]   fluoro carbon elastomer synthetic rubbers made by coli co polymerizing various combinations
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:18.000]   of vinyl and fluoride hexafluor propylene and I have noot. Yeah, it is in there. I got a,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   I got a hand to Apple for the fluoro elastomer band. I remember when they announced it and we're all
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.400]   like, yeah, yeah, you got a rubber watch band, whatever. I've been wearing cheap rubber watch bands
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:32.640]   for so long. And it's nice. Like it is, it is actually, I did not believe it until I first tried it. And
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:40.000]   it's like, I have some other watch bands, but like that basic fluoro elastomer band is good. It does
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.800]   not feel cheap at all. It's kind of, kind of, you know, now I know that it's lived an arduous life
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.800]   to get to the point where it's on my wrist. And I appreciate that. Thank you, Apple Watch Band.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.440]   Thank you, Apple Watch Band. No, I am going to wait because I think I am going to be suckered in by
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:59.520]   the tank watch and I probably means I need new bands. But this is a chance for me and finally
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.160]   to get my solo loop. How does the braided loop? Does that, does that start to stretch a little bit too?
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.400]   I don't wear them as often. Yeah. But I think I would get it tight, you know, not tight, but don't
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.920]   don't get it loose. If it's loose at first, it's too big, you know, get it. The braided does get
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.520]   relaxed over time too. I think a little more than the, than the sole loop, but the braided loop is
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.880]   so nice. Like it's pretty. Yeah. Beautiful. Can you wear it after Labor Day is my only question?
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.920]   Depends on the color. If you just want us not, as long as it's not the seersucker band, you're good.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:38.000]   Okay. Unless you're Thomas Wolf, in which case, anything more to say about, oh, we haven't talked
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.680]   about AirPods. Do you think, you know, the, the FDA finally has moved on over the counter hearing
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.360]   aids and starting in October, they will be legal. And I'm wondering if Apple is going to take this
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.640]   opportunity to start pushing the notion that AirPods could be, they don't, they will never call
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.560]   them hearing aids, but could be used for more than just listening to music.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.920]   And they already talk about, you know, conversation boost in AirPods. That's something you can do
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.320]   even now. And especially with voice isolation features and things like FaceTime. So they're
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.000]   already having that in the conversation, but I cannot wait for AirPods Pro 2. It's been, you know,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.960]   very long in the tooth. The first one, if you got one on day one, battery is not good on the AirPods
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.080]   Pro. So I'm, I'm expecting we should see that if not this event, I mean this fall at least, but I
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.280]   think this event is going to happen. I don't get excited about AirPods is just there, they seem to
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:36.160]   me overpriced. There are seeming to be lower cost earbuds that work better to me. Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.640]   My, my problem with it is that there, I think that I've used, I've tried a lot of $200 in earbuds,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.840]   and they sound great. But my problem with them is that at some point that little battery is going
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.480]   to die and you're out $200 because there's no replacement. There's just no way that's kind of
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.000]   shocking. Yeah. And that's, and that's, that's why like I, my personal sweet spot for those kind
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.640]   of devices is about a hundred bucks, because if I get a hundred, if I get like, I'll spend 25 to
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.160]   30 dollars a year for that kind of availability where after three years, I might be willing,
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.440]   I might be eager for an upgrade after three years. If I spent $250 for like really good Sony
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.360]   and earbuds, and after two years of regular use, again, they're perfectly good. It's just that
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.000]   this tiny battery is irreplaceable and it's, and doesn't hold a charge anymore. I'd feel like a
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.600]   pretty big snicker doodle. I would want to highlight there's a company called the Swap Club. And if
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.680]   you go to the swap club club.com, they actually have a proprietary technology they use to swap
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   batteries in air pods. And so you can actually mail them your air pods with poor battery life,
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.800]   and they will send you a pair with a refurbished battery. You don't get your exact air pods back
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.520]   because it takes some time to actually replace those batteries, but you will get, and it's
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.320]   much cheaper than buying a brand new pair of air pods. 50 bucks, yeah. It's 50 bucks, but like,
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.280]   you know, hundred, you know, 120 or 150 for new air pods, they're still adding some of the newer
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.760]   models like AirPods 3, and I'm not sure if AirPods Pro are available just yet. But I did those with
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.680]   my original original AirPods a couple of years ago, got a refurbished model from them, and the
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.440]   battery lasted again, I gave it to one of my kids and they used it for a couple more years. So,
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.160]   there's getting to be some services to last a little longer, a little more. So, the theory is,
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.800]   you're going to send in your AirPods, they're going to send you the same generation ones that
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.240]   somebody else sent in earlier that they had time to replace the battery, then they're going to take
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.160]   the ones you sent them, replace the battery, send them to somebody else. So, you're not getting yours
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   back. Do they clean the earwax out? It is very clean. It was much cleaner than the AirPods. I
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:44.480]   sent it. Yeah, I know. Okay. It worked out well. Okay, so they, I guess when you're taking them apart
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.760]   to put in a battery, you probably have the opportunity. You got to feel sorry for the
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.600]   intern at that company who gets the job up. By the way, it's your job to break open all these
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:57.440]   incoming boxes. They do the same thing. They do that. Yeah, this is cool. And they do the same
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.360]   thing with phones. So, I love, I love that you pointed out the hearing aid thing because I do,
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.920]   all of our talk over the years about the Apple Watch has included this idea that there are
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.000]   medical features that Apple wants to do, but they have a totally different regulatory process for
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   those, right? And that's the, that's what we said about how like blood oxygen is kind of like,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   they don't really tell you the number and they say you shouldn't use it in the ECG. You can only
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.800]   use for certain things and all that. The beauty of this ruling about the hearing aids thing is that
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.240]   I think Apple really does want to add software and hardware features or make claims about features
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.960]   that are already there in terms of improving your hearing, even when you're not listening to
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.440]   something else, being able to do things to process the hearing, the sound that's going into your ears
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.320]   and they couldn't because it beyond a certain point, I think it gets them classified as a hearing aid.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.880]   Exactly. So, I would not be surprised at all if their marketing changes, whether it's with this
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.720]   particular product or it's down the road, I feel like that is a signal to Apple and all of its
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.880]   competitors who make these things that the doors are like wide open to any innovation they can have
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:05.280]   in terms of making, you know, hearing boost features for your pods. I like the idea of the making of
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.880]   a spoke product as a over-the-counter hearing aid. I've only talked a little bit to people who
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   designed this hardware about, I think it was like a year and a half, two years ago when I was
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.680]   asking, when I was asking, I was asking around about like what do, what could like a standard
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.520]   iPhone or a standard like smart Android phone do for hearing processing and they said that one
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:31.120]   of the problems is actually is not the on device processing. It really is the directionality on the
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.280]   nature of the microphones that are built into the thing where it left me thinking that maybe the
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.400]   stock as good as the microphones are. The microphones that were designed for noise cancellation and
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.520]   dodgy phone calls is not going to be, it's not going to deliver the sort of thing that at least
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.120]   Apple would like to deliver if they're saying that, hey, this isn't over the counter hearing aid.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:56.080]   And also just as when we were talking about photography, I'm fascinated by what Apple could
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.720]   do computationally with this problem. I have the same sort of wonder about what Google could do
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.120]   with it because these are both in their warehouse, Apple's biggest strength being that they know
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.440]   how to make a consumer product that is useful, comfortable, doesn't require a lot of maintenance,
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:18.320]   doesn't require a lot of setup, and the ability to deliver, to expand their health portfolio
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.160]   this way by not creating, hey, we had to, we had another bullet item to the features of the
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:33.280]   AirPods. We actually are creating a, a, a, a set of $110 AirPods that also has $230 worth of
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:39.680]   hearing aid features added onto it. That fascinates me. And I will say there's software for voice
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.320]   isolation. If you use Final Cut out there and you ever need to remove noise or echo,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:49.200]   the voice isolation feature was just added a couple months ago and it is incredibly good.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.680]   You can even crank that up to like 80% and it does not make your voice sound robotic.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.120]   And that's the same kind of technology that Apple's putting into its FaceTime calls
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.160]   and could put into things like AirPods. Actually, I've recorded a podcast, a podcast movement last
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.400]   week at the conference, lots of room noise, lots of background noise, and I actually dragged the
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.760]   audio into Final Cut just to use voice isolation because it's that good. So if you not tried it yet,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.200]   it's a sneaky good feature. And I can see Apple rolling that out to more products.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:23.280]   I'm sorry, John Ashley, we make him use Premiere. Sorry, on a Windows machine,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.800]   no less, but we did get you new machines. Okay, yes. You're finally getting off Windows 8.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:35.680]   Your vision is clearer for the peers who have should 8.1. There's a difference.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.080]   But we're going from 8.1 to are you going to 11 or are you going to go to 10?
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:48.320]   Go to 11. You're going to 11. Yep, we are 11. That's nice. We treat you well, don't we?
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.720]   It depends on how you view a lens. Yeah, I don't know. We'll see. I do think Apple promote Live
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.520]   Listen, which they've always had more. And maybe it'd be interesting to see if they do add,
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:06.000]   is there, you know, Samsung's have this sound test feature, adapt sound, where you actually put in
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.920]   whatever headphones you're going to use. And they do like the audiologist does tones. And you say,
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.120]   yeah, I hear that. No, what? And then they do a curve and then you can actually turn, say,
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.040]   on your phone, that's how it should always be. Does Apple do anything? I've never seen anything
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.400]   like that. I've seen third party absolute to that. You can do it with the AirPods Pro.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.600]   There's an feature. Yeah, if you click a little I next to AirPods Pro, like in your Bluetooth
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.440]   settings, there is some kind of tuning you can do and it will try to adapt. It's not the one
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.000]   where it looks in your ear and tells you what you can hear, right? Because you can't do that
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.640]   with a phone, which is really dopey. No, no, no, no. Okay. I will say, actually, because AirPods
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.800]   Pro has been out for so long, I did get to try these a bare dynamic. It's one of their first in
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   ear. They're a very good headphone. I've used their over the ear headphones for years. They're
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.520]   very good. These are very good, very competitive with the AirPods Pro. And they actually do an
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.160]   even deeper test for your hearing. Well, they'll play the beeps at all different frequent things.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.240]   And I'm like stressing because I don't want to miss a beep. You do the whole test,
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.880]   but these sound very good and they have that kind of tuning built in.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.360]   Okay, just a tip. Do not lie in your hearing test.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:20.960]   It's in your interest. Yeah, I heard that. I heard that. You got to get the rhythm and you
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.320]   just say yes. So you're a musician. So I presume that you pay attention to quality of body. What
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.680]   are you wearing right now? These are the well, bare dynamic DTs, 770 Pro. I thought they were
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.840]   very good. Yeah, those are really good headphones. I love these. And obviously,
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.760]   I have AirPods Max as well. And for music listening, actually, when they first came out,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.000]   did a video with classical musicians who play in an orchestra here in Central Florida.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.720]   And the classical musicians loved how the AirPods Max sounded for some of their favorite pieces.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:56.160]   Really? But they're blue tooth. They're highly compressed. They're not. It's not. This is why
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:02.000]   I'm a fan really, honestly, of wired headphones. I know I can't. You're downloading flax and like
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.360]   running it wired? Well, I have a I have a DAC that I plug into the lightning port. And then
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.640]   and then it converts it to headphones. And then you could plug in and you could plug in good wired
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.680]   headphones like you're like those big bio dynamics. And I always think that sounds better than any
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:28.880]   bluetooth ever, including the AirPods Max, which I silly silly $550. That could change this here.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.160]   They got really good codecs coming up to sell to yeah, they're designed to address that. And
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:41.520]   I'll be honest, like I do I'm I did buy like earlier this year, like a DAC and some like
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.400]   and there you go. Those are good. High-five and those are good. They are they are really good.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.040]   And but the I find that my usage of them is when I really want to sit and enjoy and appreciate
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.720]   music, that's right. That's the focus of my activity for almost everything else. Well,
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.360]   that's because they're too expensive to wear them anywhere else. Okay, that too.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:07.520]   Let me put this way. I did not buy a stand for for these $80 like Sony headphones that I use all
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.760]   the time. Exactly. No, I'm the same way I have a high-five and five six season.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:19.120]   When I use a good DAC and wear those, they're fantastic. But yeah, HD like high-resolution
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.040]   audio uncompressed on a good DAC and a good pair of headphones. I think I do think that this entry
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:31.600]   level DAC and headphone is as good as I can appreciate. I think that if I spent another $1000,
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:37.200]   I would get maybe 3% more noticeable over my hearing. Yeah, that's right. Exactly. But
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:44.560]   at this level, yeah, absolutely. I'm still hearing things and recordings that were not there before
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:52.160]   where it's like I listen to a lot of opera that's like studio recordings of great singers.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.640]   And now I can hear them doing things like with their breathing that not just not disruptive,
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.080]   but it makes it more, I feel like you're in the room. It's like specifically, this is what was
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.480]   happening inside that room. Yeah, I don't consider a broader frequency range because yeah, I'm old.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.920]   I'm a lot older than you even. And my high ends are gone and all that. But there's an openness
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:19.120]   and a definition and the instruments are clearly distinctive in ways that lesser headphones just
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.840]   don't do. The reason is- It's like the press, not a question. Exactly. Well, see, and that's
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.760]   the problem I have with Bluetooth. Now, I'll be interested because Apple could announce this.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:35.760]   Nobody's talked about it. According to a nine to five Google Pixel 7 is going to have or possibly
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:43.680]   have this new Bluetooth LE audio with a new codec, the LC3 codecs, that are much better than the
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.920]   standard highly compressed Bluetooth audio that you get on an iPhone. Apple's always been a little
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:54.640]   laggard, frankly, in the Bluetooth codecs. There was a rumor, I think it was almost a year ago now,
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:00.720]   that the next AirPlay codec, AirPlay 3, could include like a high fidelity audio to something like
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:06.480]   an AirPods Max or AirPods Pro. And with the ultra wideband that Apple is doing like with AirTags
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   and things like that, that technology could be used to maybe transfer that audio. Bluetooth could
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.120]   be like a backup. So if you don't have an Apple device and you want to connect it just to whatever
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.160]   other music player you can, but that Apple will have some kind of AirPlay 3 technology for that high
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.600]   end- That would be great. AirPlay is always preferable to Bluetooth because it uses Wi-Fi,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:32.720]   so it's far less compressed. But I guess I'll have to get new $550 AirPod Pro Max, right?
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.840]   Yes. Yes. Along with your new solo loops.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.200]   Sigh. To add it all on the phone.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.480]   Sigh. Also, what solution are you using to isolate your chair from the floor? Because that
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.800]   really is a part of the path that a lot of people ignore.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:52.160]   Oh no, I have a butt kicker in my chair. I don't want to feel it. Anything else Apple,
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.640]   so the AirPods, there's an opportunity there. We'll see what they do to talk about,
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.560]   you know, for hearing loss or just higher fidelity. We didn't mention the whole punch,
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.760]   but camera is going to be a big deal on the new iPhone. Apple Watch.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:14.160]   So one quick note. If Apple were to announce something about the about hearing loss,
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.840]   being able to be improved with AirPods, maybe they wouldn't be able to, they wouldn't be able
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.560]   to announce it until October when the FCC's ruling goes into effect. They might hint at it
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.440]   and then actually push out an update in October.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.760]   I think that's correct. Yeah, because it's not until next month or the month after next,
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.880]   I guess, since we're still in August. Any other, you know, here's the thing I always like to do.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:43.520]   Before I go into a reality distortion field, I like to armor myself with cynical thoughts.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:51.520]   No, I like to honor myself with things to watch out for, you know, look for the graphs with no
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.880]   zero at the bottom, things like that. Anything we should perhaps armor ourselves with before.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.320]   I guess we're going to have one more show before next week so we could do that next week, but
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:10.000]   I do feel like there's always a certain amount of, I don't know, reasonable,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.040]   what did the Greens pay? Rational exuberance.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:20.400]   Rational exuberance, yes. I'm more curious to see if they try to get out some messaging about
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:28.560]   how good the App Store is and how secure it is. And also about if they're trying to
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:34.080]   basically prepare the ground for all the fights, they might have to fight against the
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.640]   FTC and the DOJ over the next year. So that would be interesting.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.360]   That is the big rumor, of course, since this is the all rumor episode, I guess we can mention it,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:53.360]   that Apple, that the DOJ is approaching an antitrust suit against Apple. This, I think
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.320]   should be taken with the grain of salt because it's almost certain they're investigating it,
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:04.880]   but the decision to pull the trigger, this is from Politico, just as Department of Lawyers are in the
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.480]   early stages, that's the giveaway right there, of drafting a potential antitrust complaint against
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:17.040]   Apple. But of course, you can put that whole thing together and then the AG or somebody below the
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.680]   AG could say, yeah, no, I don't think so. There was also similar rumors. I'm sorry, go ahead, Stephen.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:29.120]   I was just gonna say, I think Epic Games gave it a pretty good go for a while to try and push that.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.040]   And Apple just basically got out of it, just having to be able to link out.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.520]   They wanted almost every respect, yeah. Pretty much. They just have to allow developers to put a
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.160]   link in their app, which on the face of it seems, you should be able to do that. So,
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.360]   I don't see any kind of major thing happening for a while.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.000]   That's what Politico points out. The Apple was willing to spend ungodly amounts of money to
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.280]   defend itself against Epic. Imagine what they'd be willing to spend themselves against the DOJ.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.320]   And remember how long it took the DOJ to get Microsoft to cave? I mean, years and years and years
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.520]   and years. But all I was gonna say was that there was a similar rumors coming out that,
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.760]   I don't know whether it was the FTC or the DOJ. I think it was the DOJ, was also getting ready
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:15.040]   to file papers against Google. And Google has a lot more exposure than Apple does.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:21.280]   But these are interesting because last year, if we were talking about this this time that,
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.200]   last year I would have seen it as a much bigger threat for those companies than I do right now.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:35.280]   Because the FTC and the DOJ have certain independent powers they don't have to get from Congress
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:42.320]   to enforce their mandates. But however, support for bringing down Big Tech is not as big as
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:49.200]   we thought it might be over the last year or two. And a lot of, I've been reading that both of
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.440]   these organizations are like, we have a certain limited amount of political capital to spend.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.320]   Where are we going to spend it? Where can we get the best results? And there's a lot of talk about how
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.200]   trying to, trying to get Google and Apple and Facebook to bend the knee is maybe not the best
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.720]   use of their resources. Yeah, there's also the question of just from politics perspective in an
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.160]   era where there's a rising international tension and you've got a tech industry that's got the
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.120]   things that are strong in the US and the things that are not strong in the US, you've got two US
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.960]   players here that are dominant in their category. And on one level, you could say, ah, but there are
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.120]   two dominant, but politically, there's also that idea of like, well, wait a second, we're going to
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:34.080]   hurt our guys when there's so many other challenges out there. And I wonder about that politically,
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:40.640]   if they're like, yeah, let's let's let our our giants continue to do what they're what they're
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:46.320]   doing and maybe be reluctant to get into a long battle over that. Yeah. But but it could be it
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.760]   could be good for consumers and could be good for developers if because as we've been seeing over
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.600]   the past two or three years, there are a lot of things that were kind of comedic about Epic's
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:01.360]   lawsuit. But ask yourself if Apple was not going to Apple was planning already on saying, well,
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.560]   why don't we wave wave our 30% percentage for people who are making less than a million
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:12.960]   million roaches a year? What if we were to actually let let these companies link out from from their
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.760]   pages? Like these are not these are things that Apple only did when they felt as though they need
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:22.960]   to give up something because Apple is Apple is not necessarily looking out for your interests when
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.960]   you when they think that you're between them and another big sack of money.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.040]   Yeah, it's not like somebody woke up at Apple and said, you know what? 15% seems
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:36.080]   better than 30. Let's do that today. Right. If they feel they're feeling the pressure and
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:41.120]   it's the only time that they've really revisited anything they've done since 2008,
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:46.320]   I feel like is when they feel that pressure, whether, you know, and I'm skeptical that any
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:52.240]   court remedy would actually make sense or benefit people necessarily in the long run. And it would
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.200]   take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. But that added pressure is the thing that makes
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.280]   potentially Apple and or Google, you know, modify their policies.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:08.320]   I'm sure we'll have more rumors in the next seven days. So we have something I hope we do.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:14.800]   So we'll have some talk about next Tuesday because we have eight days to the Apple event.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:21.920]   Here's another rumor. Mark Gurman tweets, Apple watch changes coming to all modern Apple
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:31.120]   stores, watch band display shelves, modular wall panels, and sliding shelves. And remember the glass
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.600]   covered watch tables they came up with when the Apple Watch first came out. They'll be replaced
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.320]   with a new table where devices can be touched. That'll be in the September through December
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:46.560]   timeframe. So new ways to try on and look at. I haven't been in an Apple store in two and a half
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.920]   years. Yeah, it'll be interesting to see. Really opened up. Have they? Yeah, well, that's
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.600]   floor. You're in Florida. Yeah. Yeah. A couple months ago, I went and it was, you know, it was
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.680]   like a who concert again. You know, it's just a bunch of people everywhere.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:06.400]   Oh, who concerts? Have you ever been to a concert? No, never. I've done go to, yeah.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:12.240]   That's a really interesting reference. I have been, by the way, to who concerts and you're right,
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:16.160]   they're just like Apple stores. Maybe it maybe goes the other way, you know, who concerts.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:22.160]   Like an Apple store. Right. All I'm hoping for for changes to the Apple store is that
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:27.120]   they changed the design of that. You've ever used those tables where you want to plug in
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.680]   to power, but you can sense that there is some sort of a cutout somewhere, but you don't know how
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:35.600]   to flip it up. And then you're told, Oh, just put your hand here and you always put it in the wrong
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:41.680]   place. That was that's the only times I've ever been like angry inside of an Apple store,
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:47.600]   which is just let's put a plug right here that I can plug into and don't have to make me
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.280]   make an appointment with a genius bar to show me exactly where to hold my hand in order to make
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.240]   this thing magically flip open. It's great. It's beautiful. It's clever, but not as clever as an
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.760]   exposed power outlet. I have to say, I like Michael Steber's response to this german tweet.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:06.480]   Steber who did the Apple store timeline says, Mark, this is how I know you're not listening to my,
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.120]   I described my newsletter. We were talking about this for months. Mark, Mark, get to get to get to
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.960]   which Mark says, I know this is your domain. You're the man. Steber did that amazing Apple store
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:25.040]   timeline website that we talked about a couple of weeks ago. Okay. Did anybody read the Tim Cook
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:34.000]   edited edition of popular mechanics this month? He also did an interview, how to build tomorrow.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:42.480]   It's kind of cool. I guess Tim Cook, when he was a kid, read popular mechanics and was like a big
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.720]   fan of it. He says, I was terribly interested in things like this from cars to space travel.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.680]   He says, it got me interested in the, and many of us will remember this, the 50 and one Tandy
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:24:00.080]   science fair radio shack kit. Yep. Yep. I had that. Did you have that? Me too. Yes. It was amazing.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:07.920]   But the ability to like, to put together circuits just by the super clever system of just here
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.320]   is some interconnect, a big bag of interconnect wires. Each one of these components is hard mounted
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:19.280]   onto a board with a, just a tight spring on each end. So just slide the wires to make the electrical
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:23.440]   connection between inside these springs. And oh my goodness, the first time that I got like a
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:29.280]   seven segment LED to actually do something was, oh my God, it's the number three. Okay, I was
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:35.600]   trying to do the number eight, but still it's so cool. Yeah, you can get them on eBay. I don't
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:44.320]   know if Tandy is even around to make those. Yeah. That's, that's cool. But yeah, that's, I, I'm glad
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.720]   they asked those questions because to me, like, if I, that the, I don't, I haven't gotten like a
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.200]   lot of like extended interviews with like executives in the past couple of years. But if I had time,
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.840]   the question I would always ask is what did you make anything when you were a kid? Yeah, yeah,
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.880]   not even necessarily what we were, what your hobbies, is there something you used to make?
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:11.760]   And I have had like the CEO of, of ACE was like, went into like 30 minutes of extra innings,
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.440]   telling me all about like all the stuff that he used to like to make. Because it takes,
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.360]   it takes you off your game and you learn a lot more about what this person thinks is important.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.320]   And I mean, I have to admit that I did not, I did not read this particular interview because my,
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.160]   I won't say that I'm so cynical that I know that it's all just PR fliffery, but it's,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:36.720]   you like to, you like to see the human side of CEOs to try to get an idea of exactly what they
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.600]   think and why they make the decisions that they decide to make. I think Tim was a, was a little
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   bit more open to popular mechanics than he would have been to a tech, a tech publication,
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:53.280]   because he, they were really talking about projects. They asked him, can you, can you think about
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:57.040]   an Apple product that you, when you first heard about it, you said that's cool. And Tim says,
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.560]   oh, that happens all the time. I feel like that every day, like a kid in a candy store.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.520]   And I don't think he would have said this to Cara Swisher. We were talking in the hallway about
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.800]   M1 and M2. The history there goes back well over a decade. It goes back to the genesis of the M
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.720]   chips of the A chips from the iPhone actually goes farther back than that. Tim, it goes back to
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.840]   the Apple Newton, really getting in and figuring out how do you put a powerful chip in something
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.720]   that's small and not get it to heat up and burn up. Then he goes into a little bit more
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:33.360]   corporate. But you could, you could see the Tim Cook, the enthusiasm for invention and, and, you
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.400]   know, messing with things come through. And I think that's a, that's kind of cool. Then he goes,
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   we try to relieve privacy as a basic human fundamental right, blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.000]   Well, I was actually going to mention, I mean, privacy, even though that's kind of the, you know,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.240]   he says it all the time. And I do think it is important to the company. And I believe it when
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.200]   he says it because in the home kit and smart home world, we cover a lot of different devices from
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.800]   different manufacturers. And when it comes to privacy and security, that's one of the reasons
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.600]   why I have gone all Apple HomeKit and some of the news that came out recently. Absolutely. Yes.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.640]   You know, Amazon allows law enforcement to request Ring Doorbell video without a warrant.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.680]   You know, there's actually a website where law enforcement can go request that.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.480]   And that's the kind of privacy that I do believe Apple when they say it. And that's why I do trust
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.200]   things like HomeKit, whereas, and that stands out from the pack. And it is a selling feature,
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.520]   but it is not like probably the most profitable thing that they do. But I appreciate that he still
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.720]   sticks by it. Do you have a doorbell that works with HomeKit? I HomeKit secure video doorbell,
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:35.920]   the Logitech Circle View. And you know, even hook it up to Logitech, there's no Logitech app.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.360]   It only connects to your HomeKit home with your Apple TV or your HomePod. And it's HomeKit secure
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.760]   video. So any video recordings is saved to iCloud, which is great. You don't have to pay a separate
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:51.120]   subscription. It's just, you know, it's in iCloud Plus, you know, if you pay for iCloud storage.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.440]   And I can trust privacy and security. There's no other company that has access to that doorbell
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.280]   camera. So they make a regular cameras, but they also make a doorbell.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.480]   I actually have that camera, which is the Circle View camera. Again, works the same way with HomeKit
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.720]   secure video, but they have the Circle View doorbell. And it's the same kind of thing.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:14.400]   Ah, somebody was asking on the radio show, actually, he was asking, can I get something that doesn't
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:21.760]   have a monthly subscription, like the ring or the nest? But more than that, I think this is not
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.560]   said in my videos to anybody who asks for it would probably be also an important feature.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:33.680]   If I don't trust Amazon at all, I actually trust them less than I trust Facebook when it comes to
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:39.440]   privacy, because I do think that they are the most garbage disposal of we are going to take
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.200]   anything we can possibly get from anybody under any circumstances, whether they think that we
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.960]   have a right to it or not. Nonetheless, that was in terms of they let police have access to that
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.680]   data without a warrant or without notifying the person. That was 11 times in the first half of the
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.800]   year on a device that sells and sold to the millions. And also the only time they do it,
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.840]   and Google has the same thing in their user terms, is that if doing so will save lives
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:07.920]   in an active emergency situation, like there is a shooter in the neighborhood,
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.520]   that's the times where they 11 times said, yes, we will allow access.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:18.560]   That hackers have tricked them into you and using that loophole got them to release video.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:24.720]   So it's not the only data. Amazon will actually is able to see like your Wi-Fi network name,
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.920]   whatever you name your camera, they'll take that information. And now that Amazon has purchased
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.000]   an iRobot, which makes the room of vacuums that literally map your house.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.120]   It does seem to be moving faster and faster. That's what I'm talking about.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.760]   Yeah, especially because iRobot like a three or four years ago, when they were building up
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.600]   that business, they were this I think the CEO actually said that we think that the data that's
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:51.200]   being collected about room layouts and of individual houses would be commercially useful to
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:56.320]   like social networks and other people. So yeah, this is why I really wish the FTC will
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:04.000]   step in on this acquisition because I would trust Apple with this data. I don't think they would
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.200]   seek it. I would even trust Google with it conditionally, but Amazon is the one company where there is
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:15.760]   no way in hell this will work out well for me if they have access to, if they know what the actual
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:21.520]   map layout is. And they actually have also have access to a robot that is probably also, can also
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:28.560]   deliver data to give a sense of who is in what room, when, on what sort of schedule.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.560]   So tempted by the idea of having it through HomeKit, but there is, since I use a
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:38.640]   Synology NAS and Ubiquity Networking, I could do local, that's what you do, John, right?
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.280]   In fact, that's what we do in the studio, where it's all locals.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.280]   I was being set up to have a Synology and a Ubiquity Unified Network in my house.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.960]   Yeah, so I was thinking maybe getting instead the Ubiquity Doorbell,
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.360]   which doesn't send it to the cloud at all, I'm the cloud.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.280]   That's the solution if you don't want a subscription, right?
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.840]   If you do a set up, you're doing a local recording.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.400]   It's a lot of work. I mean, I have to run ethernet out to outdoor cameras and stuff, but right now,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:08.480]   I have a Google Nest cameras everywhere. I have a Google Home Nest doorbell, and I'm thinking,
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:12.160]   I'm sending this all to Google. I was Amazon Ring, and I thought, well, I'll do that. Now,
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:15.840]   I'm thinking maybe I should just bite the bullet and start stringing ethernet around.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.680]   On the Ubiquity cameras can do power over ethernet.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.800]   POE, yes.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.600]   But if you run the ethernet, you got data and power to all the cameras.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.800]   That's what I was thinking. So I'll go up in the attic, punch a few holes.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.400]   Put on your Schneider belt.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:37.040]   Get the key chain that goes, "Zzzzzzzzz." I'm ready. Yeah, I'm ready. That's a big project,
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.720]   but that's something I'm thinking about.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:43.600]   John Slina, that's what you do though, right, throughout your house. Do you have a video doorbell?
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.720]   No.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.120]   No.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.960]   But I have power over ethernet.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:51.280]   I actually don't care so much about the cameras. The doorbell is the best thing,
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:56.240]   because it says, "Lease is home," or whatever. There's a package, and I like it.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.320]   If you're watching your Apple TV and someone rings the doorbell, you'll literally get the
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.680]   picture and make it pop up. Get the video.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:01.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.880]   The doorbell right on your TV and your home pods can be used as doorbell chimes,
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:10.800]   and you can select which home pods you want to be used for that. So it's a great system.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:11.600]   It's very cool.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.320]   I think if you're listening to Mac Break weekly, you're probably all in on Apple.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:23.440]   That seems like, yeah, that's always the choice. I could do it myself and really have privacy,
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:27.920]   but that's going to be a lot of work and great expense, or I can find somebody I trust.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.520]   Absolutely.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.520]   I'm going to have a look at that.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.120]   Oh, look at that.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:33.600]   That's the problem.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.400]   It's not raining in Florida.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:36.880]   Okay.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.160]   No, it is nice. A nice day.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:42.240]   And you can talk back through the doorbell, like you can with other doorbell cans.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.080]   So, according to it's nice.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.320]   That's really, I do love having a doorbell camera.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.520]   Especially for like, I'm in the middle of a podcast or...
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.000]   Right.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:58.160]   It's like the number of times where it's like, if it is an emergency,
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.920]   if you are wearing fire repellent, if you're carrying a hose and you're in fire fighter gear,
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.320]   yes, I will get up and unlock the door for you before you break it down.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.120]   But yeah.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:07.280]   Right.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.360]   Well, and also you can do the facial recognition for your iCloud photo librarian.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.560]   So, you know, that's cool.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:17.200]   And it's private and secure because it's all Apple, but I've had people ring the doorbell,
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.320]   like one of my sons will just ring it for whatever reason.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   They live here, but I don't know why they're ringing the doorbell.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.600]   Anyway, they'll ring it.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.040]   And it'll say, you know, so-and-so's at the door and it's my son and I get the notification,
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:31.360]   but I can also be comfort in knowing it's private and secure and it's all through the iCloud.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.920]   Yeah. Meanwhile, I'm sending pictures of all my friends to Google.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.160]   So-
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.240]   It's-
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:39.360]   They even say that they say, in some states, it's maybe illegal.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.080]   And then go ahead.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.520]   It's weird.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.080]   I think that this is part of the- what needs to be part of the new social contract too.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.360]   Like, I don't have- my doorbell camera actually points across the hall to the door of one of my
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.160]   neighbors.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.680]   And so, like twice when people have moved in, part of-
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.480]   I save it for the second introduction of the first one.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.640]   But the second one is- oh, by the way, I have a doorbell camera.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.960]   If you want me to turn it off so that it doesn't catch you coming and going,
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.240]   that's fine. I pull up my phone and show it's actually tied to a zone,
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.360]   so it doesn't actually record anything until someone steps right in front of my door.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:11.840]   Right.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.560]   That's what I do.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.920]   But it is a- but it is a- but it is like a camera that lights up with a little green LED
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.000]   whenever you take a step out of your door.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.360]   You should- you have the right to know that no, it's not recording you or tell me to.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.600]   Can you please just like put some blinkers on it?
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.320]   It's- it's tough. I mean, I was- I was just going to say that I got a-
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.200]   I'm having problems with my Plex Media Server, which I absolutely love,
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:36.320]   but they did some sort of an update where there's a security setting on my NAS that it doesn't like.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.840]   So, under many circumstances, it's not letting- even when I'm connected to Ethernet,
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.320]   it doesn't trust the- the connection between the two.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:47.120]   And it's like, oh man, if I were- if I were just buying everything from- from the Apple store,
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:50.640]   from the iTunes store or the Google Play store, I would not have this problem.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:55.120]   I would have more problems that I don't want to have, but it's the- it's- it's- it's always
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.320]   the question of how much do you want to be secure, how much do you want to be private,
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:03.360]   and how much do you want to be responsible as the IT department for what is an increasingly
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.800]   complicated network of network devices inside your house?
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:15.360]   Yeah. Yeah. If you have a- if you have a rack in a closet that you know, you're in trouble.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.600]   When you have house- when you have house guests and you have to ask them,
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.280]   now how much do you like white noise when you're trying to go to sleep?
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.400]   Because if you like it, this is going to be great. If you don't like it, I'll shut down- I'll shut
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.040]   down- I'll shut down some servers for it so that you can sleep.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:40.000]   I fix it, says, that Apple's self-repair program manages to make MacBooks seem less repairable.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.600]   We mentioned that the M1 MacBooks were added to the repair program last week,
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:55.760]   but- but the guy that Apple sends you is apparently so complicated. 26 steps.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:02.960]   Now, they point- they do point out that the Surface Pro 6 battery replacement guide is 52 steps,
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:09.920]   so- and that the iPad battery replacement guides can be hundreds of steps, but Apple's MacBook Pro
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:18.080]   battery replacement. The official one is 162 pages long. Yeah. Wow.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.280]   This was fascinating. I looked to see what the touch ID button, if you just wanted to replace
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.920]   the touch ID button on a 14-inch MacBook Pro, what would it take? And you'd have to enter the
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.600]   serial number for your MacBook. You know, you can't just like shop for parts. You have to use your
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.720]   serial number. You'll be showing parts for your laptop. And you can buy the touch ID button by
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.880]   itself for 80-something dollars. Because I was trying to make something- I know Jason Snell and
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.960]   Mike Hurley have done like, "Ha, that standalone touch ID button." So I was kind of looking up. I
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.760]   was like, "How much is the part?" But in the guide to change the touch ID button, it said the
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:56.640]   prerequisites for replacing this is removing the logic board, removing like the trackpad, I think,
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:01.280]   and removing like the top display. And so, you know, those are just three bullet points in like,
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.440]   now you can work on replacing the touch ID button. And basically disassemble the entire computer.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:11.040]   So it does feel intimidating. But listen, if someone wants to do it, Apple has a step-by-step for you.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.560]   Maybe Apple's more complaining. So I fix it. Skyed is 26 steps. Apple's guide is 162 pages.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.960]   But it's Apple, right? So they're going to be more detailed. Also, they really cherry-picked
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.280]   something here because this is a top case in battery replacement. And Apple says, and I think
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.160]   it's an even in that story. Apple says they are working on a straight-up battery replacement,
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.160]   but they don't have that right now at launch. You can do that for the other the MacBook Air
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.400]   in the 13-inch Pro. I believe you can do straight-up battery replacements on them, but not the 14 and
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:43.680]   16 yet. So there's probably a less complicated way to do it. I think, you know, I don't know.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:49.840]   If there's a way to do it in fewer steps and I fix it, can find it, then that's great.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.400]   Again, you have to ask who are you as a person? Like, are you confident enough to take if there's
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.520]   a shortcut? Do you want to take it? Or do you want to follow Apple's advice and do it the official
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:05.440]   Apple way? Do you want to use if you go to the trouble of getting an official Apple part,
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.880]   do you want to just follow the official Apple rules? I am replacing a USB-C port on my son's
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.800]   MacBook Pro that I bought him for college, which a friend of his already broke a port on it.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:20.800]   I'm going to use this system to do it, but it is. I'm going to have to go down to the logic board,
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:28.000]   and I'm not happy about it. But that's how I have to get down to where I can have access to the
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.480]   USB-C board. Are you guys streaming that? So, I have thought about streaming it live,
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.400]   and I thought to myself, this could turn into one man's descended in madness.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.880]   So, I'm thinking I'm like, I think I might record it. I'd like to watch that, Jason.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:50.400]   I think I might record it and see how it goes. What is Apple? Did Apple say how much they would
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.200]   replace it for? Did you get a quote? I haven't, I haven't, and I have Apple. So, here's the thing,
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.800]   is it would be great content for my website, but I do have Apple Care Plus on that, so I should
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.720]   probably just call them and say, look, bad USB port, please fix, and have them do it. I will say
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:14.320]   though, the part was 18 bucks. Other than my time, and it might take an hour of my time to disassemble
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.800]   it in a lot of sweat, 18 bucks in the computer never has to leave my house versus having my son
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.960]   taking the laptop away and saying, I don't know when it'll be back, and going through that process,
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.040]   there is something to be said for it, but I do have that choice to make, and everybody does
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.640]   have that same choice, but I was impressed. Again, broken USB port, I'm like, oh man, what am I
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.600]   going to do here? And then I realized, well, I can pay 18 bucks plus shipping and do it myself,
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.400]   if I want to, and it'll probably take an hour. Does it involve soldering? No, there's no soldering
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.560]   involved. I would be all the way out if soldering was involved. Do you know how those USB
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.200]   C ports are just little, you just unscrew a little, a little hex screw and pop them right off? It's
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:00.080]   nice. It's actually pretty good. The problem is, of course, that you have to remove everything
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:03.120]   to get to it. That's why it takes a while. Yeah, exactly. You have to really dig in. Because they've
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.600]   stacked it like a layer cake, right? And you start from the underside and you've got to go through
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:11.680]   all the layers to get access to the thing that you need to pull out. And if it's something that's
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:18.400]   right at the top, it's real easy. And if it's not, it's not. That's why there's 162 pages for
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:25.920]   putting a battery in a MacBook Pro. Because there's a lot of stuff that you have to take out to get
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.840]   to the battery. And yeah, you have to replace the cover. It's one part. Yeah, the talking.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:37.920]   I have built a Lego lunar lander with a few instructions to that. This is impressive.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.920]   And that was just fun. Yeah. And look at all the different kinds of screws. There's a Torx T5, T3.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:51.920]   I will say, I fix this credit. You can buy tools from Apple, but
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:57.760]   I fix it. If you've got the I fix a kit, you are in good shape. Yeah. Yeah. I always like I fix this
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:05.040]   stuff. I've replaced a lot of iMac hard drives with SSDs and peeling off the display can be
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.600]   pretty tedious. I'm curious if the M1 iMac will ever make it into this self-repair program.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:17.040]   They told me that the plan was to get desktops into the program. So just like, I mean, the
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.600]   iPhone is already right, like a little bit extra to get into an iPhone to repair it. So
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.600]   compared to that, the iMac is going to be a problem. But I'm sure it'll be. I didn't do it. I made
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.920]   Colleen do it, but I have watched somebody add a hard drive to an iMac. And it, you know,
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.880]   follows large suction cups and things. Yeah. It's a very complicated.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.040]   It needs to go in through the screen. I do have to wonder why Apple says that among the things,
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.960]   the tools you need, including torque drivers and cut resistant cloths, you also need a fireproof
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:51.840]   enclosure. That's not, it's not reassuring. That's the battery. You're worried. That's if you,
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:42:00.320]   if you puncture a battery, you can do bad things. Wow. Wow. Okay. A lot of stuff. See,
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.560]   see, this is the difference between Apple and iFixit. iFixit wants you to be empowered and they
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:10.080]   want to sell you tools. And so they're going to be like, you can do this go you. And Apple's more
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:16.000]   like, well, yeah, you can do it. But you need some sand. And if there's going to be sand,
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.920]   yeah, there's going to be a sand container. Maybe take it to the Apple store instead. And sticky notes,
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.520]   I don't know, suction cups, more suction cups, more torque screwdrivers. This is,
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:34.480]   now do they recommend clear alcohol or like a whiskey for drinking air for for a clean?
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.520]   Yeah, is that for after or is it to steady your hands for you?
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:43.840]   Apparently there's this stuff cut the blue wire with the yellow stripe, not the green wire
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:49.600]   with the white stripe. And we're only on page 25 kids. I mean, we're already removing keys for
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.160]   some reason. I don't know. Well, that that manual's got every repair. Oh, it's got them all in here.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.720]   Okay, that's that PDF. And then I love it because after you've taken everything apart,
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.040]   then they say, reassemble it. We're not going to tell you how just reassemble it.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:10.960]   I mean, each section has a reassembly. Oh, okay. I've been I looked at I had to look at all up
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:18.560]   on USB support. Yeah. I want I want to see how this home repair program continues to evolve.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:25.680]   Right now, it seems as though Apple is begrudgingly saying that we will get we don't want to be in
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:31.040]   front of a regulatory agency saying that we don't we don't make it possible for people to repair
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:37.360]   their own hardware. However, this is also seems like something that got put together with whatever
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.160]   they had at the moment. I'm wondering what I'm really like to see two, three, four, five years
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:48.240]   from now. If they are now if they start designing things, not so that it's easy to sell for pair,
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:53.360]   not so that it would be attractive to repair it yourself instead of taking it to an Apple store.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.600]   But basically to put people in a position where there's probably a really good reason why you
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.800]   decided to fix this at home instead of going to an Apple store, maybe including it being a four
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.360]   hour drive to your local local Apple store. We have actually not we have looked for ways that we
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:13.120]   can make this repair easier to do without compromising the design of the thing we're going to we're
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.920]   going to start to put we're going to start to put things that tend to break closer to the top of
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.560]   the layer cake or we're going to try to try to use fewer adhesives where we don't necessarily need
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.960]   to use adhesive. I don't I don't think that they're going to ever it's not that they were going to
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.440]   make something like the framework laptop, but there every time that I try to do repair or an upgrade
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:39.040]   I mean just the just this weekend one of the projects was taking my 2012 Mac mini in anticipation
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.400]   of replacing with a new like Apple Silicon Mac mini hopefully in October or November.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:51.200]   Basically saying well is what can I how can I update this so that I can make use of it when
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:57.360]   it gets replaced as a desktop Mac and obviously one of them is replace the fusion drive with an SSD
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:04.400]   and that it's not it's not as hard as as on an iMac but it really is just buried there it's at the
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.320]   it is at the bottom of the pit and you really do have to take everything apart to get to it.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:13.520]   Thank goodness it's all screws and you can get to it but this is not designed it clearly never
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.400]   envisioned anybody other than someone who's wearing a colorful t-shirt with an Apple logo
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:22.400]   ever trying to access the scribe. Actually Tim Cook kind of addresses that in the popular
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.120]   mechanics interview saying you know we have to balance robustness and reliability with
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:33.040]   repairability and one of the reasons is like this is so that it's it's robust that it's can handle
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.320]   you know being you know thrown around and stuff. Here is by the way I hope you have some
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:44.000]   ESD safe tweezers Jason because here is the picture you're going to have to yes yes but I
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.400]   have the iFixit repair kit so take that checkmate Apple checkmate and mate. Somebody saying in the
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.440]   chairman I think it may be kind of true this is a little bit of sour grapes my fix it because
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:46:00.400]   this is this is this hundred C2 page manual is everything right. Well look iFixit is a great
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.360]   organization they are also an advocacy group right like they and for great stuff like great
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:11.520]   to repair yep absolutely the case but you know so so you know apple has given a little bit on this
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:16.000]   one issue is it going to be good enough for iFixit? No it's never going to be good enough right because
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.520]   iFixit is it always can envision a world where there's even more and it's more available and that
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.400]   that is what Andy described is the push and pull happens within apple and it also happens between
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:32.400]   manufacturers and iFixit which is sort of like iFixit's all about repairability that is a priority
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:39.760]   for apple because most mac repairs and iphone repairs are done by apple right like they if it's hard
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:46.560]   it's harder for them to repair their own devices that's true but they have other priorities too and
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.360]   that is the that's that push and pull that's there and i think i feel like over the last few years
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.760]   i've gotten the sense that apple has actually taken some steps and even iFixit will acknowledge
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:01.760]   taking some steps toward repairability i suspect that's because apple realized the cost to apple
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.640]   of repairing their own devices and they're trying to ease it a little bit but they've got priorities
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:11.600]   that iFixit doesn't have because iFixit's only concerned about the repairability part and not the
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:18.240]   fact that like you can't make a little air pod that's repairable that fits in your ear at that
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:23.520]   size that's the trade-off there is you're trading that off and iFixit doesn't like that and they
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:28.880]   shouldn't i like that they're an advocate for repair yeah yeah i also i also like that i i i
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.680]   you said before that apples never gonna make a laptop like the framework laptop and nor
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.480]   necessarily what everybody want uh a macbook that's designed like framework laptop where you can
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.720]   use a couple of simple tools and just do everything really fix everything you want upgrade
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.760]   everything you want nonetheless i do think that it's very very important that a company like
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:52.240]   framework exists because they are they're making it more difficult for a company like apple to say
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:58.320]   oh well look if if we i know that you're you're you're a little you're like little children you want
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:04.800]   what you want but trust me if we designed a macbook so that you could upgrade the or swap out the ssd
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:09.600]   yourself you wouldn't want to use it and then someone can just say oh well here's my framework
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:16.160]   laptop and it's really has the same performance specs price weight thinness as your macbook only i
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.040]   can two years from now i can actually put in a brand new motherboard myself if i want to let alone
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:26.880]   upgrade the ram let alone replace a busted a busted internal ssd without having to buy a whole new
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:33.120]   motherboard so it's i'm glad that the the the the flow of gravity is towards let's see what we can do
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:41.360]   to make these things easier to fix uh as jason said not only for uh smoothness from authorized apple
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.880]   service centers but also so that again also as jason said when there's a someone broke something
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:51.600]   and it seems like something that should be easy to fix without having to do without for a week or
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.200]   having to wipe the drive to make sure that nothing private leaves the that leaves your hands it should
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:04.000]   be that that should at least be an investigatable option for for every user i think uh when are we
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.640]   gonna see mac os ventura will it be in october when they announced new max jason or what is your best
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:15.840]   best best that's generally the idea is that it'll be sometime in october probably that and ipad os
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:21.680]   too tied to an event where they launched some new max and some new ipads um yeah that's and you know
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:26.800]   that's been generally when the mac releases so we're getting close are they taking to heart
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:32.240]   your and others complaints about the system settings in ventura are they listening knows
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.800]   it's a mystery right like the system settings app in ventura is so misguided and i think that's
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.560]   the problem is that i'm i'm i wrote a couple pieces about this last week and i had somebody say
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.040]   to me oh jason i hope they're listening to you and it's like you know what i would bet you a lot of
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.560]   money that there are lots of people who work on the system settings app who feel the same way i do
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.280]   and know the same things that i have suggested about this a lot of it is just common sense
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:03.520]   about how it should be structured and i feel like this is something that was misguided from the
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:08.720]   beginning at a high level where some decisions were made about what was going to be okay for a
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.200]   system settings app and it's like oh just do the ipad thing just have it be like the ipad and the
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.080]   ipad and they'll be fine and they made some very peculiar decisions the most peculiar of which
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:24.640]   being that you're on a mac every mac has a widescreen display it and they didn't make it wider so they've
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.080]   got this weird hierarchical thing where you can go one level in and then you go a second level in
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.720]   and you don't see the middle level it's invisible and it's like it's so maddening because you could
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:39.120]   just make it so i did a little screenshot where i basically like stretched it with my own hands
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.560]   and said what if it was wider like imagine if it was a little wider and this is what apple
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:49.280]   created with the way back when with a finder and the columns which is higher level.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:55.680]   See Jobs' favorite view from next and he brought it to the finder was the column view so yeah and
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:00.160]   i think like of course the people who are working on this know this but somebody whether it's in
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:05.120]   the design group or a manager somewhere said no no no no no we're going to keep it as simple
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:09.600]   and constrained as possible this is good enough and the truth is it's not good enough it's really
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:13.760]   embarrassing and the thing that really is infuriating about this i'm getting a little angry now is
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:19.760]   system preferences as an app was really bad like it is super old it was like a little you know a
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.840]   little bricolage like a beaver dam where like every year they added more junk to it and it just
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:28.560]   build up over time for 20 years all this garbage that would get thrown into the systems prep app
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.520]   every year and so that's like look we need to fix it we're going to wipe that away and replace it with
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.640]   and and that was the moment to refactor it reorganize it and they did nothing but make it look like
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:47.200]   ios and like making it look like ios is fine but like why is the safari why is the default browser
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:54.400]   in like security and privacy or something it's like they they made no reorganizational attempts to
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:52:00.240]   have it make sense and it's a it's a real shame so i hope that they will take all this criticism
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:05.840]   that they're getting from not just me to heart but i despair that the people in charge who think
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:10.560]   it's fine um are the ones who would have to do that and that even if everybody else is aware that the
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:16.800]   emperor has no no clothes the person in charge is like whatever we don't care if they just would
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:22.400]   allow that window to be resized and then use the frank oh you can resize it up it can be taller
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:28.320]   taller it just can't be wider no no so you don't need a taller one three and that's also i'll point
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.880]   out just while you're looking at it the other thing about it is it's organized it's like more
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.600]   than two dozen items in that little sidebar so it's not organized well they're in subgroups the
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:42.640]   subgroups are not labeled or explained or even understandable if you stare at them for a while
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:48.640]   of like why are those items grouped together and the subgroups are not are not ordered in any order
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.560]   that makes sense they're not alphabetical they're not there's no logic to anything in there which is
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.240]   why i did that one fake screenshot that's like why don't you just have the system preferences
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:02.800]   app be a big search box that says why don't you search for something yeah because everybody's
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:08.160]   searching anyway because the the organizational structure otherwise which could be atomic and
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:13.920]   intuitive and you could it could make it all work instead makes no sense so and you and you miss
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:19.920]   half the hierarchy anyway so it's it's just it's a disaster yeah yeah each each one of us has our
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:24.000]   has our hot buttons when it comes to oh my god did they even think about this why who designed
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.680]   this but i think that's really important to amplify what Jason said every time we on the show have
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:35.120]   had an argument about why why didn't they do it this way this and it makes no sense there were people
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:40.320]   inside apple who had this argument daily daily daily and they just simply lost people and the
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:46.240]   warm people yeah exactly and and eventually they do they do listen because it's not i do think that
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:51.680]   the initial bad decision often inside apple happens because of dogma meaning that oh well we
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:57.120]   want the simplicity of the interface because by limiting it to just we have the study that says
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:03.280]   that if you put more than three columns worth of people you know it might not be a dogma it might
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:10.960]   be we want it to look like ios we just want to be yeah that is dog yeah that is dog man i think
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:15.280]   there's that and it is exactly right there was this this idea of simplicity and it's like well look
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.200]   it's just one column but it's a lie the simplicity is a lie because one you click on general and there's
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:26.640]   another two dozen items inside it's complexity through simplicity it makes it worse you could embrace
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:30.880]   the fact that you have lots of settings in your o s and organize them in a in a way that makes
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:34.800]   sense and then make it all searchable because people are going to search anyway but if you're
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.400]   going to pretend that people don't have to go to search in order to find anything you need to make
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.640]   an effort to organize the information that's there and no i mean this is the thing that they
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.040]   inherited the worst of system preferences which is a whole bunch of settings that are scattered
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.200]   in all the whole bunch of places that don't make any sense because the answer is well that's there
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:59.360]   because we added it in 2008 and we needed someplace to put it so we put it in this place that we created
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:05.840]   in 2005 and that and like and and at no point during this process apparently did anybody say
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:11.040]   why don't we list all our settings and group them in ways that make sense how many times we've
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:17.040]   been through this with apple look at iTunes for instance you know iTunes this is exactly what
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.160]   happened to iTunes it just it just turned into a ball of mud right i think you get that opportunity
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:27.040]   to fix it or a brick a lot or just my new favorite word brick a lot yeah i love that it's like a
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.560]   beaver dam go ahead steven the one that i'm glad they've broken out login items outside of like
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:35.760]   the users and groups thing only because like that was a very hidden thing and people wouldn't know
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.480]   why applications are launching just randomly but i'll also complain about setting since you know
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:45.200]   this is fall in line but like even on the iPad you're fitting in nicely steven i like this
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:51.760]   thank you thank you the settings app on ipad you still can do split view or slide over and you know
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:56.480]   if the settings app is going to be this swift ui like the same on iphone on ipad and on the
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:00.560]   mac OS at least let me do a slide over settings pane on the ipad rather than taking up the whole
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.840]   screen and so there's a lot of work to be done in general this is a Jason's proposed solution
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:10.960]   just go to system settings and there's a big search bar because why don't you search for that
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:16.240]   like on an item to do this in the scrolling list or just give up and do the inevitable in search
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.840]   which is of course what everybody will do yeah yeah and that's it just i mean if you're gonna
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:27.280]   if you're gonna pretend that people might use the sidebar you should organize the sidebar yeah
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:32.560]   otherwise why even have the sidebar yeah uh which has missing is missing lots of things where like
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.880]   as a as a longtime mackie's or i i went in there and i'm like where's startup disc where's startup
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:40.960]   disc i need to reboot to a different disc where's startup disc the answer is it's in general now
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.760]   search it's not in the search you just search yeah and then it shows up as a search result in the
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.320]   sidebar and i'm like oh well there you are but it's not actually in the sidebar it's in the submenu
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:54.400]   and you have to anyway i agree with steven completely one of the great things let's be
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:00.400]   positive one of the great additions in system settings is your startup items used to only be apps
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:07.760]   and now it shows you all of the the system startup uh demons and startup items that are at that higher
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:15.040]   level so if you've got like something that installs itself in your system folder and is auto launching
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:21.360]   a background task at launch it used to be invisible and now it's actually in the ui so you can turn it
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:26.880]   off and that's awesome like good job to whoever did that i'm sorry what i said about your app but
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:35.280]   your future was great uh roman loyola's screenshots in your mac world article uh are great please give
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.960]   roman uh my regards i love him yeah uh although he does he look like that now is that his new look
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:47.040]   because uh that's uh that's wild i don't know i don't know i don't think roman looks like it
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.000]   uh but yeah this this is how it's going to be when ventura comes out and it's just it is it's the
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.960]   ios uh system settings and yeah there's some consistency that's okay like that's not the problem
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.920]   that it looks like ios is not the problem right right it's everything else it's everything else
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:09.520]   yeah see this is this is this is why you always you're as a long time observer your ears are very
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:14.560]   very tuned when they do like a new uh when when kraig does the first like introduction to the
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:21.200]   next version of the operating system you you you listen for the phrase we people love this feature
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:26.320]   and we made it even better that means that no you made a huge mistake everybody needs it
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:32.240]   and now and now and now we've totally revisited it because we want people to know that yeah you
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:37.520]   should try that again because it sucks a lot less now we are ready to wrap up and get our picks of
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:43.920]   the week but i i want to once again say thank you steven for emailing me and uh and uh and it was
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:49.280]   really great to have you on we will absolutely have you back steven robles who is the uh video and
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:55.600]   podcast creator at appleinsider.com he's also at beard fm and i just want to point out uh it's good
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:59.920]   your email came when it did because this morning i came in and dan moron sent me
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:07.040]   books trying to bribe me apparently so we'll get we'll get this is the uh the trilogy from the
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:12.000]   bayern uh the bayern. Yeah it's the galactic cold war trilogy available at bookstores everywhere
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:18.640]   like dan moron i appreciate it and uh you know nice try but the bride didn't work we tell you what
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:23.120]   next time he's still on he's still on paternity leave for another week or so all right i'll wait
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:27.520]   then give him a chance no i love dan we'll have mornin thank you for sending me the the whole
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:33.360]   galactic cold war trilogy that's that's fantastic i really appreciate it all right steven since
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:37.840]   you're the newbie by the way thank you for filling in for Alex lindsey we appreciate he'll be back
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:45.920]   next week i think if not it'll be dan moron let's get your pick of the week steven robles
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:50.880]   absolutely well we talked about airpods max before and so i actually got a new stand for the
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:57.040]   airpods max this is called the max stand and basically what it does it solves the charging
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:02.000]   and desktop issue because you have to charge airpods max with lightning which is kind of frustrating
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:08.000]   so i put it in the bra and then just floppy there on my desktop with a lightning cable plugged into
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:13.760]   it i hate it which is it's not great so what this stand does it comes with two of these like lightning
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:20.080]   dongles and you stick this lightning dongle into the airpods max it's pretty low profile you know so
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.800]   it's just a very simple stand i must say and then this stand right here uh it'll wirelessly
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:32.080]   charge the airpods max when it has that dongle attached so you can just set your airpods max
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:36.240]   on the max stand and it does put it to sleep there's a little magnet on this side that you
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:41.840]   even have to put the bra on anymore no no not necessary and then this stand you just plug in a usb
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:47.840]   c and so now my airpods max stay charged i can just take them off the stand use them as normal
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:53.360]   put them back on the stand and they're charging and asleep and so this is now my desktop airpods
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.440]   max stand i don't have to worry about them you know losing battery slowly over time they'll stay
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.200]   charged and it puts them to sleep so they won't show up in all my audio inputs and outputs when
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:06.000]   i'm doing a call like this so max stand two thumbs up comes with two of those lightning dongles too so
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.040]   if you lose one they give you a second one or if you want to partner as you know two pairs airpods max
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:16.560]   those are those two dongles two pairs i'm glad it comes in colors it will match my pink airpod max
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:21.120]   yes you get all different colors i thought i was really kind of passive aggressive when i
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:24.960]   bought my airpod max i thought i'm going to buy them in the worst color since i have they're making
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.400]   me buy them i'm going to buy them in the worst color and now i have a game because i wear them when
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.840]   i talk to my mom on my ipad every week i FaceTime her and she says every time she says oh you've color
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:40.320]   coordinated and i always try to get something that matches the airpods pro max whatever the hell
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:45.760]   they're called so now my stand will match too you know what i'm buying this i think this is this is
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:52.960]   totally solves oh it's pre-order oh well you can get it it took about a month and a half to come i
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:56.640]   think so it's not too long okay was indigo they were making them in the airship they
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:01.440]   they've raised a lot of money for this that's awesome that's great yeah i love it good pick i
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.800]   am going to buy them they're from Germany so they're well made jamming 79 euros
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:17.520]   um and by the way dan moron is not a fool he also sent a bunch of galactic cold war stickers yeah he did
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:25.120]   now he's going to get some advertising on my on my macbook Andy and aiko your pick of the week
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:31.440]   oh boy this was a really really great app that i discovered last weekend uh and it's been around
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:36.720]   for a while but i went so i went to a bird sanctuary with a friend of mine who is like an avid
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:41.840]   birder and she had this amazing app now we we did not we spent like three hours walking around
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:48.880]   beautiful it was a beautiful huge nature sanctuary we did not we we only saw saw like a couple of birds
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:54.320]   uh but we spotted a whole much more because she had this app called merlin on her iphone that
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.280]   you just keep it run it it's the the app is for identifying birds and you would think that that
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:04.320]   means that okay well that's so so if i if it will show me it'll get my location and show me here's
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:09.760]   the kind of birds that are usually in your location it maybe if you just if you have photos you can
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:15.120]   match up what you think you saw to uh to identify the bird the coolest feature is you just keep it
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.520]   running you just keep the microphone open and whenever there's a bird call it will just the
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.880]   screen immediately like lights up with uh could be this this this this and then as it keeps calling
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.040]   the list gets a little shorter and that tells you know it's almost certainly this this this or this
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:36.320]   82 blue bird maybe 8% chances this other thing so because birds maybe it was because it's late in the
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:40.720]   season the birds thinks where he doesn't put out the birds until the weekends where the bloods the
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.640]   tourists come over uh but we didn't see see much but again we were able to know what birds were around
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:51.520]   just by taking a look at the phone and saying here's that that bird call you just heard here's
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:57.920]   what it refers to probably uh it will also work based on if you are uh don't have the app open
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:03.200]   but if you furnish it with a recording it can analyze that and on top of everything else it will also
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:07.840]   work with photos it will it will also help you identify if you've taken a photo it will work you
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:13.680]   will it'll help you uh it'll ask you a series of questions for identifying a bird so uh i have
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:19.040]   to admit that for someone who's lived and roughly the exact same like 50 mile radius for his entire
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:25.440]   life it's it's kind of embarrassing that it took me until now to recognize what uh what a blue j
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:30.720]   sounds like because i always thought i've heard this bird call all my life but i thought it was a
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.520]   like i thought it was a crow or something you know it is a it is a blue bird and now and so now i
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:41.120]   i put it on my own phone it's available for ios android anything uh and now it really is it's one of
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:46.560]   those apps you have standing by and you realize oh my god i can now like have an answer to a question
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.760]   that occurs to you like uh like uh several times a month when you're when you're out and about um
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:57.840]   it's partly funded by uh the the bird lab at cornell university it's a lot of crowd funded work
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:04.240]   excuse me crowd sourced work happening here but yeah it's one of those apps where you have it on
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.600]   your phone i almost guarantee you'll end up using it within the month it is and it's it's a viral app
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:15.120]   too because you see this working and it is magic it's like as soon as she like opened this up and
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:19.200]   and just like showed me the screen it's like do i have enough self-service here in the woods that
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.960]   i can actually download this right now because i want to download this right now it's so cool
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:31.280]   that is really cool you know it joins a whole category of apps that identify rocks plants yeah
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:37.280]   i think this is this is a great use for is it ai i don't know i just saw a story that with
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:45.120]   their now being able to talk to naked mole volrats via ai so maybe soon the naked volrat identifier
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:49.360]   and i think that'll be very exciting a lot of a lot of the stuff on this app it's not it's not like
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:53.120]   it's it's doing a mechanical Turk thing where someone is looking at this photo or listening to
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:59.360]   this and telling you what it is uh it works as very very logically they when you first install it
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:04.960]   like you can you can choose to download uh a knowledge database of bird calls for your entire
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:09.680]   region so for instance i downloaded all the birds for a bird package for the north east that
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:14.960]   they're definitely doing this 750 megabytes but that means that it doesn't have to have self-service
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:20.720]   broadband connections in order to do the stuff it will just plain work again such a and such a
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:25.920]   beautifully designed app i can't it's it's the sort of app where i'm just looking for where is the
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:32.000]   tip jar for this where is the patreon for this because rarely rarely do you see an app that is
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.320]   so beautifully made and so suitable for for purpose that doesn't leave you hanging where oh boy wouldn't
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:42.000]   wouldn't be great if it could just like i could just leave it open and it would identify bird
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.240]   calls automatically but of course i don't live in the 24th century that's wait a minute that's a
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:52.400]   built-in feature holy crap it's so funny because we have at least it's been putting out bird feeders
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:56.160]   in the backyard and we've been trying to figure out what's that what's that what's that this is
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:06.640]   perfect timing we are approaching a hat trick because i have purchased the max stand i am downloading
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:13.600]   the merlin bird id now it's up to you jason snell to make it complete what is your pick of the week
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:18.080]   my pick of the week is jus discord well i know you do because club twit members
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:23.680]   that's all in discord a lot of us have discord i wish that slacked did this it doesn't for bots
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:28.640]   but it doesn't let people do this uh this is a free app uh for the mac on the mac app store called
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:35.840]   elsewin and here's what it does you set a time and it copies the code it's actually like the
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:40.720]   unix timecode to the clipboard and you can paste it into discord so if you're talking to somebody
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:48.240]   in discord and saying i'm going to be on tomorrow at five p.m my local time you can put that time in
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:56.320]   to elsewin and click copy and paste it in and the people in discord will see it at their local time
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:01.520]   what and separately you can also just put a regular human readable thing on the clipboard with a
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:05.440]   bunch of different time zones if you want to paste that in somewhere like in a slack so it's
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:10.400]   basically a tool that helps you communicate to other people in other time zones about
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:16.640]   what time you're actually trying to communicate and and i love it for discord because i can say
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.400]   i'm going to be on doing a live podcast at nine a.m on friday and i put that in and then i see
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:27.600]   nine a.m friday but somebody in new york would say new non friday and somebody in australia would say
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:32.800]   i i don't even know what they'd see five a.m on saturday but it's uh pretty great and it's a feature
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:39.280]   that's just in discord um you have to use the unix time format but you know elsewin takes care of
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:44.720]   that for you and i love it because it means that everybody's on the same page about what time it is
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:50.400]   whereas in slack i will often post you know a pacific and then it's up to everybody else to
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:55.120]   figure out what pacific time means yeah we do that i do that in an audio form i wish there were
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:02.400]   a way oh yeah you need elsewin for audio because i'm always going you know two p.m pacific five p.m
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:10.560]   eastern time 1900 whatever utc uh this is so yeah it is a hat trick i mean it was easy because both
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:16.480]   andy and your picks are free which makes up for the 88th yoros i bid for the mister
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.160]   no no no i'll no i looks this week i think that's what happened yes that's what happened
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:26.400]   actually steven did a great job of taking the high end but uh not so high that i couldn't afford it
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:32.640]   elsewin looks great you know uh so i don't it doesn't just have to be for discord because i could use the
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:38.560]   kind of universal one and paste it into slack or whatever too right uh yeah the problem is yeah
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:44.000]   the the ones where it puts human readable text on the clipboard you can use that anywhere yeah i
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.040]   wish flat this feature yeah discord is the only one that lets you put in a unix time with brackets
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:52.160]   around it and it just converts it to your local one right that's a discord feature of course discord
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:56.080]   it's very and it's nice very clever and you can even choose what the formatting is so you can say
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:01.040]   just a date or you can say a date and a time and and discord formats all nicely for you it's really
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:08.400]   great elsewin by benjamin cardi it is mac iphone and ipad uh a lot of us discord i just were in my
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:13.360]   ipad so that's very handy yeah uh and it's everywhere for somebody in the chat room who wanted to know
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:20.960]   where the max stand is it's the max stand dot com easy emay x not m a c s yet

[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:20.640]   have noticed for instance that this particular episode of mac break weekly was ad-free that was
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:28.560]   through no intent of our own it's not how we want it uh but that you could see how much better it is
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:35.120]   without the ads that's what club twit members get ad-free versions of all of our shows access to the
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:40.400]   club twit discord and the twit plus feed which includes a lot of things that don't make it into
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:45.920]   the podcast including shows we do exclusively for the club like hands-on mac mica does that
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:51.680]   hands-on windows for paul thorat the untitled linnick's show uh really great show from jonathan
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:57.120]   bennett and company because everybody in the in the club pitches in on that one the giz fizz
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:03.440]   with dik d bar total and i'm sure there will be more uh and probably more importantly than
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:08.320]   anything else your seven dollars a month yum that's all it costs does really help us continue to produce
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:12.640]   new content uh and on weeks like this where there's no heads from heck break weekly
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:19.600]   helps helps make it possible so it i am very grateful very grateful to you uh for uh for
