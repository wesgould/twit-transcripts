[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.400]   Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Hello, Renee. Hey Leo, I made it back. Your side of the world is much warmer
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.560]   than my side of the world. Is it? It's not snowing in Montreal yet, is it? No, but it's cold and
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.240]   you have such lovely weather in actually. We got the cold weather is starting to come. You know,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.560]   it's like 60 degrees now. It's freezing. I must have left it behind. I apologize. Also here,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   from Baston or the environs somewhere in New England in his secret lair is Andy Enochko.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.160]   Reading from the Great White Northeast from the Chicago Sun times. What's the picture behind you
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.920]   there? This is from this is from New York Comic Con about a couple of weeks ago. A whole group of
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.200]   people that just decided dress up as the entire Scooby-Doo cast plus the old caretaker dressed up as a
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.600]   ghoul. He's not a ghoul. It's the old caretaker. Notice the lady dressed up as Scooby, which I did
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.760]   not even notice my picture. I like to. I like the girl. She's got it. Change the relationship between
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.880]   Scooby and Shaggy. You're a girl. It does look like Simon Pig on the right. That's not Simon
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.800]   Pig on the right, is it? That is not Simon Pig on the right. Whenever I go to one of the things I
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.640]   enjoy about cons is taking pictures of people in costume. I always just in the back of my mind,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   I'm playing a game called You Know Who You Should Cause Play as, even sometimes so yes,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.320]   he should be cosplaying as Sean of the Dead character. But I pass by someone who I almost
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   wanted to just stop with and interrupt what they're doing and say, I know that you're not in costume,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.920]   but you could so totally be David Bowie in the 1970s. You could be Ziggy Stardust, you could be
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.080]   the thin white Duke, you could be that freaky guy in the clown makeup. You should totally go with
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.040]   David Bowie next time. I don't even want to be paid for my consultancy fee and telling you what to do,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.400]   but please, please. Is that on your Flickr stream that picture? Yeah. Andy, I on Flickr if you follow
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.440]   India and Flickr. Oh, yeah, there it is. Usually I post like instead of instead of posting like
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.800]   winning a couple weeks and posting like an album of like a hundred pictures, I seem to be now just
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.200]   posting one a day because now people will actually people have the patience to see like one photo a
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.640]   day when I give them here's a hundred years half hour of your life to get through all the stuff
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.560]   and everything I've written about this really said, I'm Velma is hot. You're right. Chatter is
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   Velma's hot. And that doesn't look so much like Simon Pegg. Why don't you see the blood on his face?
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.480]   All right, let us move on, ladies and gentlemen, because we have a lot to talk about. Apple released
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.200]   its quarterly and fiscal year results yesterday. And you know, I think it's a walk off home run
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.920]   in the bottom of the ninth, frankly, it looks pretty good. I'm doing I'll be doing baseball themed
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.800]   for us throughout the day today. Looks pretty good. Apple market share its highest since 1995.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.720]   Still single figures. I mean, it's not like they got 20 market share, but still the max surged.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.880]   Yeah, really good performance for the Mac fourth quarter surge of 21% year over year revenue growth
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:03.120]   up 18% year over year. Luca Main Street, the new CFO says we saw great demand in the back to school
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.920]   season for both desktops and portables, especially strong growth from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.000]   double digit Mac growth across most markets around the world. That's important with particular
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.480]   impressive performance in emerging markets where max sales were up get this 46%. Is this the halo
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.720]   effect? Are they they're they're using iPhones down? They're going, hey, I should see what else Apple
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   offers. Don't know about merging markets, but we have to we have to pay attention. The fact that
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.200]   I think there was a lot of pent up demand for the Mac Pro. And so they sold lots and lots of
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.680]   those to people who weren't who weren't just like routinely buying Macs. These are people who had
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.040]   been deferring that purchase for about a year. Did they break it down by by model the Mac Pro?
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.680]   No, but no, but I'm guessing that if there's if there's reason it's certainly possible to be a
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.960]   halo effect. I believe that that must have contributed because that's probably one of the
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.480]   I can't think of another Mac release that has been so eagerly anticipated as that one.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.040]   When we had people who were just saying, I'm done waiting for you, I'm going to now build a
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   compatible Macintosh tower out of available components and hack the operating system to run on it.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.080]   That's how long I've been waiting for you to release an update to the Mac Pro.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.920]   Adrian Toxic Health Stu Hughes says, he's going to be that to me forever now,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:30.320]   says the momentum may just be starting because remember the iMac is the new 5K iMac's not in this.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.000]   One thing that I think also is that while the point bumps weren't that impressive this year,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.400]   they price cut many of the Macs. They dropped them by $100. And even though it's only $100
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.240]   over the price of a Mac, that's pretty good incentive. I do think that, especially in emerging markets,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.880]   that Mac or Apple awareness is driven by iPhone and iPad, don't you think?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.080]   Yeah, there's a halo and the device, I mean, there's a continuum now where people are introduced
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.760]   to those devices. And then, you know, people thought that we'd be going from the trucks to
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.680]   the cars, but there's still a lot of things that trucks are better for. And when you combine,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.600]   even the new Mac Mini that was introduced, it's gone back to its original price, $4.99,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.680]   $100 cheaper again. When you combine those two things, I think that gets people moving.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.240]   By the way, that price point is probably the more important bullet point when you're talking
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.640]   about the Mac Mini than the fact that you can't update the RAM, that it's basically a MacBook Air
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.160]   in a different conclusion. A lot of the geeks were disappointed, they wanted a better Mac Mini.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.960]   But the price point is where Apple was headed, right?
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.440]   Absolutely. That's the thing that really stands out to you when you look at the Mac Mini lineup,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.960]   there is such a huge disparity between the entry level model and the very next step up. I mean,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.640]   the middle model and then the best model are they look like sister and brother. This one looks like
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.440]   a cousin in terms of his relative power, the processor it uses, the amount of resources that
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:01.600]   are available to it. And I stifled my reflex to say, "Oh, of course, it's a woefully underpowered
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.040]   machine." But no, it's not underpowered. It'll run everything just perfectly fine.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.560]   And if this is a sign of what Apple had to do to get the price down below $500, I'm all for it.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.600]   Because the next level up is a big jump. It's like 50% more expensive, a little less than 50%
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.240]   more expensive. So that's going to be a very important $200 for a lot of people. So if it makes,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.080]   if it lets people choose a Mac instead of a better, even better configured Windows machine
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.840]   that's a desktop box, even though they wanted a Mac, that's a great move.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.200]   It's interesting because it's at the same price point as the entry level iPad.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.800]   Which is kind of interesting. And you don't get a screen.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:45.120]   I'll start iPhone. So iPhone 6 was out for less than two weeks in this fourth quarter.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.080]   So I don't know how much the iPhone 6, well, we could actually do the math because they said how
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.360]   much. It was the launch quarter though. I mean, it was the launch tweaks, which are always high.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.280]   That makes a big deal, even if it's just the first couple of weeks of the launch.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   It was the iPhone's third best quarter ever. They sold 39.3 million phones in three months.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.600]   That's up 12% compared to the previous quarter, 16% year over year.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.800]   It's a license to mint money, Leo. It really is. Yeah. It really does put you in the mind of why
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.000]   Apple really wants to move into consumer goods like the watch. Because how many desktops can they?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.800]   A people will have a couple hundred bucks and they'll have a few hundred bucks just to blow on cool
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:31.760]   stuff. So it's I think that this time next year we could be looking at some numbers that are like,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.160]   now we must fear Apple and beg for its forgiveness for past things we might have said about it.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.920]   Yeah, I'm starting to worry. Cumulative iPhone sales, which is kind of a silly figure,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.040]   but they did put out a graph. So I'm going to show it. They now have sold close to this.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.800]   Can't think this is wrong. 600 million iPhones. Yeah. Yeah. What?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.920]   Not as many as Android phones, but wow, are those profitable.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   And also also sold by one company. I first I encountered the figure at 400,000, 400 million
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.120]   a while ago. And I had to double check it because it doesn't make sense that this company could sell
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.840]   anything in a number that could be expressed as a fraction of a billion dollars. And now it's
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:23.440]   over half a billion. I'm not off a billion dollars. Half a billion. I know times how much money they're
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.680]   making on every phone. And it's like we we praise our new Apple overlords as a member of
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.040]   every as a coast on a popular podcast. I can do much to sway public opinion and to get law enforcement
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.960]   in line to your new directives. I can be quite useful to you, Apple. Don't crush me like the
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.000]   it that I have Apple's margins are up to. There were some concern in the market and among users
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.200]   analysts that the margins seem to be tumbling, but they were up for the first time in some quarters,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:01.040]   some quarters and revenues for the iPhone were up 20% compared to last quarter, 21% year over a year
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.920]   profits up even more. They're selling more of the higher margin products now, which is good for them.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   Of course, Pete's analyst expectations. You always want to do that. Apple's very good at damping down
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.080]   the expectations and then over performing, which is good for the stock price. Usually,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.920]   you know, the stock market buys on the rumor and there's been plenty of those and sells on the news.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   The news was of course yesterday, but the stock price was going up up. It's up another 2% today.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.600]   And once again, they could not make enough to sell. I think Tim Cook said it wasn't on the same
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.160]   planet, the supply that they could make to reach the demand. They could have made, you know, how
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.720]   many could they have sold if they were in balance? It's ludicrous numbers.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.040]   In a way, they should be punished a little bit for that, that they make such a great product and
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.960]   they can't make enough of them to sell them. But that's, I would quit any boss who said,
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.880]   oh, you only, I know, I know you sold 40 million, but really could have sold 42 million.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.440]   Yeah. We've only, we've only filled that swimming pool up to an inch above overflowing with gold
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   doubloons. I want your resignation letter on my desk by 2 p.m. I bet you'll screw that one up too.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:22.720]   Now, of course, the iPad, you know, mixed in with all this wonderful news. I think it was not only a
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:29.200]   record quarter, but it was a record year, fiscal year. Is that right? I should look up the actual
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.080]   numbers. Yeah. I think they said this is the best year ever.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:44.000]   You kind of want that every year. Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess. Yeah. And the iPhone by itself is
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.480]   capable of driving them to that, which again, is scary. That's such a successful business,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.200]   but for that to be your most successful business. Record profits for the fourth quarter.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:02.480]   And I think record revenue, we didn't give you the bottom line, which is sales, a total sales of
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   42.1 billion and a profit on that of eight and a half. Yeah.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:16.320]   Improved profit. They just can't empty those of all's fast enough. Gross margin, 38% compared to 37%
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.840]   year over year. International sales, 60% of the quarter's revenue. Good news for Ireland and the
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:31.120]   Cayman Islands. A lot of cash could be flowing in. A lot of good for truck drivers on the money
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.880]   delivery route from the airport to the post office box where all the checks go. I got all the
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:50.160]   Franklin's in the back. iPhone sales up 16, 2%. I max sales up 20%. I pod sales. Oh, let's say
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:58.640]   I pod sales. iTunes sales up 8% accessories up 12%. Now, and app stores getting really interesting.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   What do they say? 85 billion apps have been sold. And the money they're making off of it now. I
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.240]   think people, because for a while you have the feeling that the app store was being neglected,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.680]   that the iTunes store was being neglected, that the technology there wasn't being as improved as
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.080]   fast as device and operating system technology. But if it keeps making money like this,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.840]   it'll be hard, I think, for even people inside Apple to say, no, no, no, we need, you know,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.640]   we need somebody to take this in its loving hands and propel it forward.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:32.880]   So, of course, iPod sales down 25%. By the way, Apple still this, we're no longer going to break.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.640]   This is the last time you're going to hear the word iPod sales. We're no longer going to break
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.280]   that out. We are not going to break out retail sales. I don't know why I think retail sales are
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.360]   very positive. And we're not going to break out watch sales when the watch comes out.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:56.240]   Luca Mainstry said, oh, no. Of course, the iPod's tumbling. They only sold 2.62 million of them.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.920]   Champod touch hasn't been updated in three years now. And they're still selling. I mean,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:10.080]   even that is like, but you're still selling millions of them. And the iPad down for the third quarter,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:16.000]   in the most, of course, of all 12.5%. But remember, they didn't have a new iPad. Everybody knew there
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.200]   would be a new iPad this month. They still sold 12 million. That's more than a million a week.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.080]   So they're selling. And Tim Cook said, I think he really wanted to, I think, one of the analysts
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.720]   on the call at the end of the call said, well, what's going on, Tim, with the iPad? Are you worried?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.960]   And Tim Cook was very clear. And I think said exactly the right thing that he's still very bullish
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.120]   on the iPad. He spent, he actually gave a very long answer. I'll quote a little bit of it.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:53.200]   He said, I take a step back on iPad. I know there's a lot of negative commentary in the market,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.720]   but I have a different perspective. We have sold 247 million over the first four years.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:06.320]   That's more than the first four years of the iPhone. So that's a good point. He says,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.080]   to me, I view it as a speed bump and the lack of growth year over year and not a huge issue.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.760]   That said, we do want to grow. We don't like negative numbers on these things.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.640]   He said, there is, I know, some of you think that the market is saturated.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:28.560]   But from the data he sees, he says, no, my market data says the top six countries for Apple in
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.960]   terms of revenue generation all had more than 50% iPads sold to new buyers.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.200]   The worst was 50%. In some countries, 70% sold to new buyers. That means more new people are
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:48.800]   coming in to buy iPads. Well, that to me confirms the saturation, but okay, because that's the point
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.480]   that people who are still buying don't yet have them. He says, we're not saturated. We think there
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.280]   are a lot of potential new buyers for. Oh, okay. So not everybody has an iPad, but those who have
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.760]   iPads, I think, are maybe not upgrading as fast as one would hope. He says, yeah, we don't know yet.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.600]   This is a new product. He said, it's hard to say what the upgrade cycle will be. We know what it
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.320]   is for a phone. We know what it is for a computer, but we've only had four years of iPad sales.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:23.920]   He says, in response to suggestions that products are cannibalizing iPad sales, he says, maybe
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.400]   people are buying Macs or iPhones instead of an iPad. But hey, I don't have a problem with that.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.160]   They're still buying something, which is good. I think Apple's been very good about it. Yeah,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.920]   Apple's been willing to cannibalize one for the other. But he did finally say, I'm very bullish on
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.040]   where we could take the iPad over time. They'd rather cannibalize themselves and have another
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.360]   company do it. We're going to continue to invest in the product pipeline. We're continuing to
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:58.320]   invest in distribution. And of course, we won't see the impact of the new iPads until next quarter.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:08.160]   I do feel like the iPad era is poised, maybe even in 2015, to become something very different from
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.560]   what it is right now, which is the larger version of the iPad Mini. I think that Apple with some
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.960]   software updates and also some making a larger device can really emphatically start talking about
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:28.880]   this as just as a productivity tool. It was the thing that really spoke out to me at the event
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:36.320]   last to live stream of the event last week was that the apps that they showed off for the iPad,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.360]   the third party apps, they weren't the soft focus. What will you reverse be today? And look,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.760]   kids are drawing pictures on isn't that adorable seeing them drawing pictures? No,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.600]   here's something that here's an art app that's about as powerful as Photoshop for photo editing,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   for image creation, and another app that's kind of similar to that. So I don't know if this is
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.120]   a prediction of something, but it made me think that this would be how Apple would do it if they
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.920]   wanted to next year, have a larger sized iPad, have a new version of iOS that really did allow
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.240]   you to run app side by side or even in a tile configuration. Because as you pointed out, the
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.960]   cheapest iPad they make is the same amount of money as the cheapest Mac that they make.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.400]   And I think that one of the if there's a reason why sales are a little bit flat,
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.840]   it's because people are have stopped the the the really the glorification halo
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.920]   halo around the iPad is kind of dimmed right now is no longer the new cool thing that people
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.280]   have never seen before and they've got to try out. Now it is a $500 computer that people now have
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.320]   to justify the expense of a $500 computer. And that's how they say, well, yeah, it'd be nice to
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.360]   have this cool big tablet for games and stuff like that. But I only have about 600 bucks total to
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.800]   spend on to upgrade my my system. So I think I'll get a Windows laptop instead of something like that.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   But if they were able to make that change, simply say, here is a 12 inch version of the iPad Air.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.640]   And here's why you'd want to have this instead of the notebook that you thought you were going to be
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.040]   buying sometime this year. I think that would really be the shot in the arm would be a greater
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.080]   distinction between the iPad Air and the iPad mini. And it would also maybe even reverse the trend to,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.920]   I think a lot of people once they were once they were presented with an option of we can we can
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.840]   either give you a 9.7 inch tablet the size of a sheet of paper or a smaller tablet that is small
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.880]   enough that you could probably get inside a some of the pockets you own. If not, it's easy to be.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.960]   It's easy to find a pouch to put it in once presented with that option and the smaller tablets
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.440]   were on the market, people seem to be voting very strongly for smaller tablets. So I think that
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.000]   that's that's a way to sort of smooth out the bump in the road that Tim's been talking about.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.240]   Anything else we could say about the, I mean, it's really interesting. Go ahead.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   I think there's I think there's a couple of things that are interesting. One is that when Steve
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.400]   Jobs made the original case for the iPad, he said that it had to earn his right to exist between
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.320]   the iPhone and the Mac. And back then, the iPhone was very small and it was, you know, there still
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.400]   wasn't as much you could do with it. And the Mac was still more expensive and didn't have very
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.520]   long battery life. But now you have iPhone six plus, which turned it sideways. It's almost a tiny
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.240]   iPad and you have the MacBook Air, which gets phenomenal battery life and the prices lower than
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.400]   ever. And that squeezes the iPads in the middle and squeezes the iPad mini, which had become the
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.920]   most popular iPad. And even though it's got like a hundred percent customer satisfaction rating,
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.000]   more people are looking at, I don't maybe need to carry both. I can just carry the iPhone.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.200]   And I think that also sort of liberates the iPad a little bit. And you know, to Andy's point where
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.680]   Apple can do more interesting things with it and showing off Pixelmator, like they did the content
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   aware of Phil, they just removed it. I think it was a cow, like right from the field. Yeah,
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.520]   it's amazing. I mean, that's the sort of, that's the sort of power that you want when people are
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.720]   looking at this sort of mainstream productivity where I can't strap a Mac to my back and take it on a
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.800]   bicycle ride with me. I can't take it onto the football field. I can't take it onto the beach,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.840]   but I certainly can take an iPad and I can still get done all the productivity things I want to
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.400]   do. I can run my company. I can start a company. I can do all these things. I think as we go into
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.120]   next year with things like the iPad Air 2 and if there is an iPad Pro, it'll, instead of being
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.200]   stuck in the middle of the iPhone and the Mac, it's going to really create its own identity.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:28.400]   Well, you know, I've always thought the iPad was very interesting. I think the thing that we'd
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.760]   no one predicted was how big the phones would get and how ubiquitous the phones would be.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.040]   And the question, the kind of lasting question that's in the data problem.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.920]   What is that? What do you mean?
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   Our Skype is just like, so if you, if they were going to sell half a billion iPads,
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.200]   if they were going to sell half a billion iPads, they sold so many so quickly it got to that level
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.160]   very fast. The iPhone that the hockey stick wasn't nearly as big as that. They had more time.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.760]   So if the speed limit for the iPad right now is half a billion, they just got there super
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.040]   quick and that's why it's leveled off. But if they can find some other angle for that,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.960]   they can jumpstart that. It can take it off again.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.240]   I agree. I agree.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.440]   I also think that people haven't really figured out where a tablet exists in their lives yet.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.920]   Despite the fact that this thing has now been out for four or five. Well, as soon as can be,
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.440]   at least on the public map for five years, the fact that even Microsoft has had problems
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.280]   selling, here is a computer that will run Windows. It is a Windows computer. It attaches hard
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.080]   attaches to a keyboard so you can make it into a laptop. But you can also detach it and use it
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.160]   like a tablet, even those are not really setting the world on fire. So I think that everybody's
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.280]   trying to figure out what do people really want a tablet to do, what role does it play,
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.680]   and there's going to be a whole lot of guessing until they figure out what that is.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:53.920]   Yeah. Well, look, the bottom line is great quarter.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.040]   Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   You can't deny that. And the stock price may not fully reflect that. It also reflects the
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.560]   fact that Apple's very aggressively buying back stock. What do they say? Another $20 billion
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   in the stock buyback and the market loves that. That bolster is the price up, keeps it up above
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.920]   100. So very good, very good news for Apple.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:28.720]   Did they mention Beats in the... I hate to bring this up. No, it's getting even more relevant
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.560]   every time they have another event in which they let themselves do a little Beats in joke,
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.240]   but not talking about why they spend $3 billion on a company. It's becoming increasingly more
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.600]   troubling and interesting. Well, it's not like they don't have the money.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.800]   And it's like a guy who says, maybe they spent the money just because, you know what,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.880]   we've got this. We have no place to put our pinball machines because of all these bags of money.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.760]   And if we could get this conference room just cleared out of money, we could finally have that
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.680]   tournament we've been wanting to do. It's just like, it's fun. It's fun money. It's like buying
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:11.120]   a pool table for the break room. It's just, it's like, yeah, we got it. Why not? Let's just do it.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:16.240]   Let's see what happens. By the way, an update on Colin Kaepernick, 49ers quarterback. He is now
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.320]   taping over the Beats logo on his headphones, even though everybody clearly knows those are not bows.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.560]   But I don't know if he's going to get a fine for that. Let's take a break. When we come back,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.240]   I do want to... There's so much more to talk about. Apple... There's a little Beats news.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.040]   Apple wants to get the price down to $5 a month, apparently. That's according to recode.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.840]   And that is in response to Spotify offering $5 a month family plans for up to five people,
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:48.000]   $5 per person. I think $5 might be the new $10 when it comes to streaming music.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.720]   The truth is no artist makes any money at all, anything worth talking about from Spotify or any
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.760]   of the other streaming solutions. And so it's nice because artists never made money. The labels
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.400]   always took it. Now, the labels aren't making money either. So there is a little karma in that.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.480]   I do wonder what's going to happen to music. But yeah, I was having a conversation with
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.200]   people about this just the other day that between apps and music and things and services,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.520]   we have to start training people to expect to pay for things that they value,
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.720]   because this is not a curve that is well for anybody. I had that very same conversation with,
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.960]   okay, a little name drop, Paul Simon, a couple of weeks ago. The Republican candidate or the
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:38.000]   musician, even better. And he and both both he and Steve Martin were saying we don't make any money
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:48.080]   on any of the streaming services is pennies. I love how casual you put the spotlight on the
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.920]   Paul Simon reference so that we would skip over them with the Steve Martin reference.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.880]   It's a terrible name drop. And I apologize. No, no, if I had if I had a personal interaction with Steve
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.440]   Martin, you'd be sick of hearing me steal here about it by now. I admire your restraint.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.920]   I only bring it up because it's germane because here they are. They're working musician. Steve is
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.680]   to by the way. Now, I mean, I think that's what he considers his profession. He's a working musician.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.400]   Certainly, Paul is. And both of them said this, we're not going to make any money on streaming
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.360]   music. That's and you know, Paul said, and I think this is really relevant. You know, he's made his
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.480]   load. He doesn't need any money. But his kids, both his kids are musicians. So he says,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.880]   I care about this because I worry about the next generation of musicians and how they're going
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.680]   to make a living. And there is no easy answer to this. And boy, when you see, let's now spot a five
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.920]   bucks a month, beats wants to be five bucks a month. That's even less money. Not that the money
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.800]   mattered at this point. I think everybody agreed it wasn't significant. So I don't know what the
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:53.200]   solution is. I'm sorry. My, my, not only scape-crapping out, but you're semi, you're semi-stying.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.200]   [laughter]
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.000]   That's, you know, this might be a good time to take a little break. We'll get everybody dialed
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.680]   back in and I'll reboot my computer while we talk a little bit. You have forced com.apple.webkit.web
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.840]   content to quit. You bad man. And it's still beach bawling on me. But that, but doesn't that
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.280]   error dialogue look beautiful in that new flat interface? Did you notice, by the way, that if you
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.600]   continue, maybe you don't, maybe you guys use a library, but if you start using Chrome,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.080]   I get a little pop up saying, "You have your tricerphari. It's really great."
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.160]   What do you care, Apple? Maybe they do.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.720]   I didn't get that. That's weird.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:36.960]   I, I've got it now in all my systems and then I just use safari and it crashed. So you have your,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.760]   you have your answer. But I have a beautiful, beautiful test.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.600]   You know, just sit on about this mibrant. That's all you need.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.800]   Gorgeous. Just gorgeous. Are you, just stare at that for a while.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.560]   Actually, this is a, this is a whole two year old laptop. So maybe that's the problem.

[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.160]   for being a part of the Macbreak Weekly family. All right, let me go back to Chrome for a moment.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:09.920]   See if that works. Are there, how, what is the, what is the take on Yosemite right now, Renee?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   Are people pretty happy with it?
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:19.120]   I mean, it's got the same sort of bugs that you find in any just released product, the same
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.480]   you find in Mavericks or Mountain Lion or anything like that. But I think most people, most of the
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.240]   time right now are having a really good experience. It fixes a lot of things, it adds really good
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.760]   features like extensibility and continuity. And it's got people interested because as we've pointed
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.160]   out, people don't actually like change. They like the perception of change. And when you change the
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.080]   visual design, while they're a little bit adverse to it, it's also not boring anymore. So it feels
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.840]   very fresh and new and that gives you sort of a honeymoon period. I agree with that. And you know,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.760]   we're all, you know, somebody pointed out, you think it's bug year now, remember OS 9,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.160]   remember system seven, remember G mail and G mail on Mavericks. Yeah, I mean, these things happen. So
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.360]   we'll work the bugs out, I'm sure. I have to say, I've been very happy with it. One of the things I
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:08.160]   love continuity, I love handoff, I love using messages on my desktop and my iPhone, you have to kind of
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.800]   delegate an iPhone to be your, your phone and your message app for your desktop. You do that in the
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.160]   messages settings on your iPhone. You can actually flip a switch. It says I message,
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:25.040]   I messages can be set between iPhone and iPad, iPod touch and Mac. Once you flip that switch,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.000]   you'll get a number pop up on the screen on your Mac, which you enter into the iPhone,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.680]   validating that in fact, you do have that now. I also have text message forwarding.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   And it says one device, I presume that means I can have multiple devices. Is that right?
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:46.240]   Yeah, let me try it here on my Mac book is terrifically, I mean, I have a bunch of old
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.680]   iPhones scattered around my house to use as extensions now, because they just all ring when a call
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.520]   comes in. Okay, that's an unusual situation. Maybe not. I don't know.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:03.600]   So if you turn it on, you get a little, so I could pick, so these are all the Macs associated
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.480]   with my iCloud account. And I have, this is the one at home, the Mac Pro, but I could take one of
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.320]   these other ones and associate it over to iMessages. And then that means they all work.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.960]   Is that right? They all would answer the phone. They would all send messages, all of that stuff.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:27.760]   Yeah, I have it on a Mac Pro and a Mac book here right now.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   We are having such trouble with Renee. Andy, you're okay, right?
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.400]   I'm fine. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. I don't want to talk over what Renee is
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.480]   certainly going to say, because I know it's going to be interesting.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.240]   But you did call it back, right, Chad?
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.320]   I wonder if it's us or if it's you.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.600]   I've been trying to do speed tests to Toronto to see if there's some sort of
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.720]   look at you. He looks like Scooby-Doo.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:34:02.000]   But yeah, Renee has a good point a lot. I have had some difficulty adjusting to the new
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.800]   interface of Yosemite. I'm starting to leaning towards the conclusion that I don't like it,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:12.240]   but really much of it. Well, I just, my difficulty is that after a few months of using it now,
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:20.880]   my eye still doesn't know. I think it does a poor job of queuing me as to where I'm supposed to
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.200]   be looking at any given moment. If I leave my desk for a minute to go get a drink and come back,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.360]   it takes me a few seconds to realize what's the frontmost window, what's the task in the
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:37.520]   frontmost window, how is the frontmost window laid out? It really feels like just a plane of light
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.560]   gray to me with very, very little differentiation among it. But the continuity feature of things
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.640]   ringing elsewhere in your house when you get a phone call is a good example. It's a great feature.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.000]   And I think like Renee, I think a lot of people are going to be asking their kids for their old
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.360]   iPhone 5s and 5s back because mommy and daddy need that as a living room phone extension now.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.200]   You can't use that to play games on anymore. But I got so many responses from people,
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.560]   questions from people asking, how do I upgrade yesterday and now my iPad keeps ringing and this
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.000]   keeps ringing and how do I turn that feature off? And I will point them toward the solution page to
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.840]   tell them how to turn off that feature on that device. But still saying, why don't you wait a
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.520]   few days? You might find that you actually like the convenience of being able to answer the phone
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.120]   pretty much wherever you go. So that's a risk that Apple was willing to take that. You can't
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.840]   really make a radical change in any way without getting a lot of people honked off. Some of them
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:39.120]   honked off for good reasons, but some of them honked off because they're not lovers of computers.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.080]   They're not lovers of technology. They want a car in the driveway where they get in, they put the
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:49.360]   key work is supposed to go. It starts up and they drive it. When you change the shape of the steering
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.240]   wheel, when you change the key and the ignition to a start button, they're saying, I am not here
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   to learn how to new drive a brand new car. I'm here just to get to the store. So I think that's
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.600]   where a lot of the pushback is coming from. Renee has a really good Yosemite hub on
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.720]   imore.com. In fact, he has a good six minute video, everything you would. You need to know about
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:14.400]   Yosemite on that hub. One thing I should point out that the message is handoff that I just showed
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   requires eight one. So you have to update iOS to eight one. And then you're going to get even
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:26.480]   more of this handoff and continuity stuff from Yosemite. And people are a little bit confused
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.360]   because the handoff, like the actual handoff functionality where you move out back and
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:37.920]   forwards requires Bluetooth 4.0. The SMS relay requires you to be on the same active network
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   and the call forwarding requires you to be on the same LAN or WAN. So there's sort of different
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:46.240]   parameters for each one. But if you have Bluetooth 4.0 and you're on the same network, you should be
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.880]   good for all of them. That's a really important point. So for instance, Google Hangouts, which
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:58.000]   also does SMS and data based messaging, does it over the network? So you don't have to be on the
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.960]   same Wi-Fi. But in this case, you have to be at home or at work on the same Wi-Fi network for both
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.680]   your iPhone and your Mac, for you to be able, for instance, to send text messages or to receive
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.520]   a phone call, that kind of thing. Is that correct? And part of that is security. So like,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.360]   yeah, the Bluetooth is for proximity because it's a security feature as well. It wants to make
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.040]   sure that you're in physical possession or at least within eyeshot of your device. So no one else is
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.360]   getting your web pages or your apps. And the SMS thing, again, this is all part of their security
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.520]   system where they're fairly certain you're the one getting those messages. If you're on the same
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.240]   network and logged in, you also have to be logged in with the same. And you have to put in that
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.440]   security code. And that's just to make sure your stuff doesn't leave your devices. No, and I appreciate
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.200]   Apple doing that. And it also, it doesn't work on older devices. It doesn't work on older devices
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.280]   because some of the very old devices, it wasn't a great experience. So like in typical Apple fashion,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.440]   they just turned it off rather than ship it on spotty or older devices. You can't, according to
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.800]   imore.com, I've heard of them. You can't just add a Bluetooth interface to an older device either.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.640]   Hand off won't just work because you have figured out Bluetooth. You do have some information,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.880]   but it's basically you've got to have the hardware, the right hardware, the right software
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.080]   in a basically a late model Mac, late model iPhone and the right software on both,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.240]   most up to date software on both. Is that right? Yeah.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.040]   Yeah. And again, it's just because turning it off is easier for them than leaving it on in a
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.720]   state where it would be problematic to people with older hardware, more support costs and more
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:32.400]   frustration. And of course, that raises the forced obsolescence cry. But this is how you move ahead.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.200]   Yeah. Your old phone works just with your old features. Right.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:45.440]   Yeah. And they would never do that because they, I think Gruber said this too, they have family members
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.720]   using these machines. The engineers, they are carried deeply about the quality of their software,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.760]   and they just want to make a good experience on as many devices as they can.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:58.320]   I've been using AirDrop. It now works cross iOS to Yosemite, right? No.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:04.080]   Yep. Oh, good. Yeah. iOS eight. I was hallucinating.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:13.760]   Which could happen. You get tired enough sometimes. So that's cool. So you so now I can share files.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   That seems to be working much better. It never was cross hardware platforms. But now it is.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:29.920]   I think, you know, I think this is a luxury. It's nice. It's not enough reason to say,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:36.880]   oh, I have to get all new hardware though. Right. I mean, at some point, things break down.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.240]   And you buy a new WhatsApp, which means that you finally get to see what people have been using
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.640]   for the past year. I think that a problem with a lot of tech journalism and I certainly take
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.600]   responsibility for this for whatever role I might play in this is that we get so excited about these
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:58.320]   things that we kind of make people want things without incurs them to think that yes, but do you
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.360]   need to get this right now or the fact that you have a perfectly good iPad mini, having touch
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.760]   ID would be really great. But your iPad mini is working just great for now. And at some point,
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.400]   you're going to drop it at some point. Your kids are going to be clamoring so hard for
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.280]   for an iPad of their own that you're just going to hand it to them. And at that point,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.160]   you'll finally have touch ID. You don't need to be in a rush to get these things.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:26.880]   We also got 8.1 yesterday. And besides now the SMS relay, which is great. There are some other
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   features. Obviously, Apple Pay will cover that in a second. Let's get to Apple Pay last
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.800]   because we have we have actual video somebody using it. Did you love Jason Snell's article?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.600]   I love Jason Snell's article in which he says, what does he say? Local man uses Apple Pay.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.480]   Local man uses Apple Pay to buy groceries. What I replied, I replied to him that the real
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.240]   coup is getting area man to use that. That's what he knows really.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:41:00.800]   Jason ran over to his whole foods, bought a sandwich. He tells the very, very funny story
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:09.360]   of his checkout guy, Tyler, who said, Oh, you're going to try that? I guess Tyler hadn't had
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:15.840]   seen it yet. Jason says, yeah, I'm one of those people and habitually placed my thumb on the phone
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.200]   as if I were going to unlock it, which was what I was going to do. But instead of doing that,
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:25.760]   boom, I paid for the groceries. The terminal actually noticed before he even tapped it or got
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:33.360]   close to it noticed him and talked to the iPhone and he saw on the iPhone screen pay with Touch ID.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   And all you had to do was touch that. And then Tyler, his checkout guy said, whoa, I don't know
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:47.520]   what just happened as a paper. What'd you do?
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.520]   Dude, because just more games than something right.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.200]   Paper receipt popped out of the printer's register and Jason walked home and he noticed it also
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.920]   stopped raining. So what a great article. Well, yeah, all right, we're doing Apple Payman as
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.120]   we'll keep doing it. We have a video, we sent our own Jason Snell, Jeff Needles by name,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:14.080]   out to Whole Foods to buy chicken fingers. And this is, I think we could show this video of
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.480]   him buying chicken fingers with his iPhone six. There it is. So that, wait a minute, stop,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:27.280]   pause that for a moment. Because it shows other stuff. If you go back, it shows American Express,
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:34.560]   it shows Visa Discover, MasterCard's PayPass, and Apple, it has a little Apple logo, Apple Pay.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.960]   All you really need to see is that logo in the middle, because that is the universal sign for
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.800]   the technology that the Apple Pay uses. So supposedly, if you don't see the Apple Pay logo,
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.560]   but you do see that little Wi-Fi with the finger next to it, you're good.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:55.680]   It kind of looks like, I don't know, a fish skeleton and a guy picking at it on a plate.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:01.120]   But anyway, you know what we're talking about. All right, so go ahead and play this. So did you
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:08.720]   have to tap it? Jeff, no, you just... It sees it, pops up your credit card. At this point,
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:14.000]   you could choose a credit card, but Jeff always wants those starwood points. So he had the credit
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.720]   card, and there you go, and the receipt comes out and you're done. Approved. And you get
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.240]   pumpkin pictures. Apple magic. Apple magic. So...
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.360]   Go ahead. That's exactly what you want. I mean, it couldn't be much easier. You feel secure,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.320]   because it did need a fingerprint to do it. Although, if you had other device, you might have to
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:40.720]   enter a pin instead. Yeah. It's, I mean, I was before the show, I was talking about how this is the
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.280]   best... Some of the best advertising that Apple could possibly get are all these data breaches.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   And on the same day that I downloaded iOS 8.1 and got my... The iPhone 6 setup for Apple Pay,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.760]   I also got a phone call from my bank that issues my credit card saying, "Hi, by virtue of the fact
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.400]   we don't know that your card has been compromised, but we do notice that you shop that Home Depot
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.800]   at any point in the past year. So we're just going to give you a brand new card with a brand new number.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.840]   And so, yeah, that underscores the need for a system like this. That's a pain too, because now
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.440]   you need a new number, which you won't with Apple Pay. Yeah, and of course, I already finished
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:23.440]   like configuring the phone for my old credit card. So it's like, I haven't activated the new card
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.200]   yet, but it's going to have to happen like I'm gonna have to do that tonight. Let's talk a little
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.520]   bit about that. When you go to your passbook, you have to launch your passbook app and you,
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:38.880]   again, you have to have 8.1. There's a little plus button on it and you can add passes as you've
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.480]   always been able to do for tickets and so forth. Or, and this is new credit and debit cards,
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:50.880]   pay with Touch ID using Apple Pay, add a card. Now, you could enter the data by hand, and as
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.360]   Apple pointed out, you can also take a picture. There's a little camera there. Now, I found some
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.720]   of my cards, it can't read the letters or two blossy or something, but most of the cards it was
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.640]   able to, it's not taking a picture. You actually hold it there and it scans the number, scans the
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.760]   expiration date in your name. You still have to manually enter the security code on most cards.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.000]   In fact, in all cards, I've tried because it's on the back or for whatever reason it doesn't try
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.680]   to read it, but it isn't hard to add a card. In some cases, you'll need an authentication
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:26.720]   app, I'm told. Yeah, well, not necessarily, not even sometimes an app. When I set up mine,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.880]   I just happened to take the path of least resistance and said, oh, well, you have a credit card
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.920]   attached to your iTunes account. You want to use that. That's the first thing you could do right
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.720]   away. Tap, tap, tap one button and if, and the security code and that was exactly just to,
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.360]   just as you do every time you do it, you try to use a new device with a credit card attached
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.320]   to iTunes and then like second layer, so okay, you're good. Now, and this is kind of nice. This
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:55.040]   is the interface. It shows you the cards you've added. Not all cards can be added. Bank of America
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:00.400]   and USA to the banks I use, their cards hadn't yet been approved. Yeah, the corporate card
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.040]   card would work either. Yeah, I can use my American Express business card. In fact, both my American
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:11.600]   Express cards, no problem. And Chase cards work. So I have a Chase Visa card, I think, in there.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.000]   But yeah, so it's not all your cards will work. But, you know, if you have one or two, and if you
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.360]   have a card already on file with iTunes, that will work. Yeah. So that's actually the best.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.200]   One thing I'm curious about because we have the pay wave on our credit cards and bank cards here,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.600]   and you can just go and tap and it works really easily. But every store seems to have a different
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.840]   limit in what they'll allow the NFC to pay for some. It's 60, some is 70, some is 100.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.040]   And the icon is always there no matter what. They don't have the good sense to hide it if you
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:41.040]   can't use it. So you end up tapping and then being frustrated. And I'm hoping because of the
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:46.400]   touch ID that it's more authentic, like it's more reliable. And maybe those limits won't be as
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.200]   as frustrating. Somebody in the chat room says that he just got an email from Bank of America
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.240]   saying it does now work. So these they're signing up these banks fast. And I may be
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.600]   imagining this is one of those things where the banks that like there's calls are pouring into
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.040]   Cupertino saying, Hey, can we we want to sign up? Yeah. It's also it's interesting. Well,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:13.440]   I talked to people who are like ex banking people, ex credit card people from this is this
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.840]   information like four or five years old. But they said and the stress on the on the word
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.560]   ex banking credit card people and they said that they've done them that major issuers have done
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:28.240]   the math on how much will it cost for us to make credit card fraud a lot harder to pull off versus
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.840]   how much are we paying out for credit card fraud? Because frankly, most people they catch it.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.280]   They get they get invalidated. They get their money back. And it's they much rather eat the cost
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.800]   of a $300 Xbox that someone charged but didn't was an authorized to pay then have to do all this
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.280]   stuff with re issuing cards, putting a new technology, training people up, training support staff.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:55.280]   And so it's nice to see that this I think that the with the proliferation and professionalism
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.000]   of these rings of credit card fraudsters, it's now become less expensive for them to finally
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.480]   upgrade their infrastructure to make this sort of stuff harder. These crimes harder to do. Right.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:10.960]   Yeah, I didn't I didn't notice that my new card is now a chip card. So maybe part of this was,
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:16.160]   okay, here's an excuse to get everybody upgraded to more secure cards now. So it's I think that
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.000]   we're definitely seeing something that there's something that's happened behind the scenes where
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.360]   some number on some spreadsheet just went from black to red. And that's why we're seeing such
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:30.160]   embracing of these new technologies. Maybe it was because I have a B of A business card that didn't
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.120]   work because Bank of America does have a big page saying shop on the go with Apple Pay. It's easy
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.080]   to add your credit card and your debit card. So I'll have to it. I have another B of A card. I can
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:47.040]   try and check it out. No money in that account, but at least I can try it. A future Leo, how is it in
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.000]   Canada? Well, you don't have Apple Pay yet. I mean, we don't have iTunes radio yet, but we have NFC
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.560]   everywhere. I pay for I use my credit card, which is the same functionality to pay for everything.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.720]   The Sears takes it, gas station takes it. So we're just waiting. We're just waiting on our banks
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.840]   and on Apple. Please do it. This technology is called EMV, but Steve Gibson talked about it
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:13.040]   on security now last week. It stands for Euro card, MasterCard Visa. And it's been around for a decade.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:22.960]   And apparently, President Obama just to yesterday or the day before signed the bill,
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:29.040]   the Buy Secure Initiative to speed up adoption of this EMV system in the US. So it all is kind of
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.960]   coming together here. The Euro pay MasterCard and Visa system is his same system Apple Pay
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.240]   uses. So we're going to, I think we're finally entering the 21st century here in the US.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:48.960]   And Apple Pay wasn't the only way to do it, but what's great is it was it put it over the top. It
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:55.040]   like said, okay, there's no coincidence that President Obama signs that bill like two weeks after
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.240]   Apple announces Apple Pay. There's tens of millions of phones on the market immediately that can use it.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.720]   Right. Well, and I presume, you know, I'm looking, I have tap and pay in most of my
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.640]   Android phones. And I'm just going to have to try and see how they work.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:14.880]   Yeah. Isn't it great though that this Apple's finally making it is a certain amount of credibility
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.120]   that they add to this whole concept. It's not as though people that we shouldn't have trusted
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.000]   tap and pay before. It's just that, well, we have a card that has worked for this transaction,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.680]   as long as we've had credit cards, why would we, again, like we were talking about earlier,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.120]   why would we have to, we don't want to have to learn something brand new, even if learning
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.480]   something brand new is in our best interest, as long as the old thing is continuing to work.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.960]   So it's great that Apple is even for people who don't own iPhones, making them think about alternative
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.760]   payment systems, and maybe even causing them to ask themselves and then their bank's website,
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.040]   can my Android phone do that? Well, yes, we have this thing called Google. Oh, great. How do I set
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.080]   that up? Here we go. And now you're now you're now you're set for tap and pay yourself.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.760]   So what you're saying, Eddie, is basically the United States is like your uncle Bob,
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.240]   who said, I don't need a new credit card system. This one works fine.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.080]   My my uncle Bob say, go get your uncle. Go to the other beer here. Good boy. Don't don't
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.680]   tell me I'm going to give you the story. What else is new in the eight one? We're going to the
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:16.240]   iCloud, the photo, the camera roll is back. What can you explain to me? Is this just semantics or
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:22.320]   is there actually some functionality that disappeared? And I was upset because the camera roll was a
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:27.120]   giant repository for every photo you'd ever taken, every image you'd ever saved. And he, it was
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.360]   basically it was it was a poor name for what it was. They called it camera roll, but it had stuff
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.200]   in it that didn't come from your camera. So they tried to make something that to them was more
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.120]   rational that you would have recent photos in there. And then they'd move on to moments and
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.440]   collections and years over time. And people just looked at and said, all my stuff isn't here. And
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.640]   they freaked out. So now you have the familiar camera roll back. I don't know if it's going to
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.760]   go on forever anymore because all my stuff was moved out of there. So I have to wait and see.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.440]   But at least the name is the same. So people no longer think someone is coming to their house
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.120]   and taking their stuff. Just like Microsoft putting the start menu back, right? It's something
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:07.120]   you don't need, but everybody wanted. So Apple's Apple actually to their credit turned around a
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.760]   lot faster than Microsoft. Microsoft a couple of years to bring back the start menu. Yeah.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:17.200]   But wasn't it incredible that could you imagine three, four years ago, Apple not only reversing
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:22.320]   themselves on a decision, but also from the stage with a worldwide audience saying, we had a lot
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.560]   of customer feedback. We've decided to put back something we took away because people didn't like
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.960]   what we did. It's so easy. And this and this is not designed as a slam against Apple whatsoever.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:37.120]   Just as an indication of how much Apple has changed in recent years that we either they would have
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:42.960]   stuck to their guns and just waited out this problem or they would have made the change in iOS
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:48.000]   8.1.2 and just not told anybody about it. And of course, we would have picked up on it. We would
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.360]   have said it, but they would have admitted nothing. It's like the car company that just spontaneously
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:58.160]   decides that they're going to change to a different model of relay that triggers the
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:03.280]   airbags on the front of the that car that's been on 60 minutes three times the past year.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   No admission a guilt. We're not saying there was a problem that we just spontaneously decided to
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.520]   use a more expensive component for that. Yeah. Well, if you put the camera all back,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.280]   the same time they took the orientation lock button off the iPad. So you get something you
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:21.680]   would say. Hey, what is this iCloud photo library we're talking about here and where
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:32.400]   does it live? iCloud settings. Okay. And it's in beta. So use it with caution. What do it do?
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:38.480]   So it's sort of its near line storage for your photos. So it's using Apple's cloud kit and it
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.840]   takes your photos and it keeps the most recent and frequently accessed ones on your device locally.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.480]   And the rest of the stores on Apple's cloud, it shows you thumbnails. And then when you tap on
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.320]   them, it'll download them and show them. So it lets you, instead of having your entire phone taken
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.720]   up by photos, which happens to a lot of people, you get just like, again, you get the most recently
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.360]   accessed and most frequent photos on your device and the rest is all stored up with however much iCloud
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:06.000]   storage you decided to purchase. See, that's good. I mean, I don't need that because I have Google
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.280]   Plus Facebook Dropbox are all in my transporter. They're all backing up my photos automatically
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.720]   from all my phones. But where a lot of people, normal people, they're all in the first of all,
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:22.480]   we will have one phone and then they fill the phone up with pictures and they never take them off.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:29.360]   They never back it up. They lose the phone. They go, what? So turning this on makes your
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:34.480]   is backing up the photos. But even more, it's freeing up space on your phone, which is great.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:40.400]   I know so many people who have no space on their phone because they just have thousands of pictures
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.680]   on there, right? Yeah, I'm just looking at one right now. So what we should do is we go to photos
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   and cameras in the settings at the top there. If you have 8.1 iCloud photo library beta. So if I
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:58.080]   switch that on, automatically upload and store your entire library and iCloud to access photos
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:04.160]   and videos. So it's uploading all the pictures on this iPhone and it's going to take off the big
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:11.040]   photo and put the thumbnail there. Do I lose quality when I tap it? It'll store the original
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.280]   file, including raw files, if that's what you have. But it will put a device size optimized image
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.800]   on your computer. Perfect. That's just what you want. And then there's some more settings here.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.680]   I would caution people though, like if you should have Yosemite and iOS 8 on all your devices because
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.800]   you can only access it with devices running in Yosemite or iOS 8. Yeah, that's kind of the gotcha
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.720]   for me. I really wish they'd found a way. I know it's a basic infrastructure. It's not just an app
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:38.560]   they've updated. But you really have to go all in across all your devices. And that's what's keeping
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.600]   me from upgrading to this to this feature right now because I still I still for instance have one
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:49.760]   I have one leftover Mac that's even still running that's still running Mountain Lion.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:56.720]   Not because I refuse to upgrade it to Mavericks, but because it's working fine. It's a low use machine.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.120]   I've got apps that I've been installing on that for the past like three or four years. I don't
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   want to have to find out what is not compatible with the latest operating system.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:10.080]   And this is a bit of an inconvenience because it's going to force me to not just simply flip a switch
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:16.960]   and enjoy photo syncing, but now go through every single device I own and make that decision about
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:23.840]   either locking this thing out of access to photos or having to walk through an administration problem
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.520]   of trying to make sure they will still do the things I needed to do after I flipped that after
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:33.680]   I make that upgrade. Can I log into iCloud and see him? Yes. Yeah. I I'm not sure if it's still beta or
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.320]   not, but you can go to iCloud.com and there is a photo library there. It might be the beta cloud
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:43.440]   though. Yeah. That is one of the nicer features of this compared to what the pictures roll used to
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.760]   be that it really does make it much easier to simply say I've been taking photos and how they're
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:52.160]   available to multiple devices. I think it's even exposed to the Windows version of iCloud Drive
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.360]   if I'm mistaken. It is not in the beta. It's in the regular iCloud Drive. There is a beta symbol
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:03.440]   on that icon. So if you go to your iCloud, you log into iCloud.com, you'll see this new photos
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:09.040]   icon and it says beta in the corner. By the way, they've also added an iCloud Drive icon,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:15.600]   which is good. And we'll talk about that in a second. And then my library is empty because it's
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.840]   not yet added or somehow. I mean, even though these are uploading, it's still uploading. So it
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.720]   has an added. And it'll work on photos from Mac when that ships in the spring.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:27.280]   Neat. And then, okay, so underneath this, there's a checkbox now that I've turned it on that says
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:32.800]   optimize photo storage. Oh, sorry, phone storage. That's the thing where it deletes the pictures off.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.280]   So there's two. Yeah. One is that it doesn't store any of them locally, but you can also have
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.960]   the option of it storing optimized, like screen size optimized pictures because you may not need
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.640]   the eight megapixel version just to look at on your phone. So it'll scale it down on the cloud
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.480]   and that's what it says. This phone is storing device optimized versions. Turn on
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.520]   download and keep originals to store full resolution photos on your iPhone. So you do have some granularity.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:58.480]   You can say, don't believe them. Let's keep them. In fact, let's keep all of them even from other
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:05.760]   other iPhones or other other sources. And then upload to my photo stream. That's the
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.840]   that's the traditional photo stream, right? Well, there's two. So there it's in his poorly named.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:13.120]   You have the photo stream, which is a traditional photo stream. Then you have the shared photo stream,
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.120]   which is Apple's little social network where you can like and comment on each other's photos.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.640]   Right. Okay. Yeah, I turn off photo stream. I don't want
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:26.480]   I don't know what devices it's going to. So I want to take better safe and sorry. Yeah,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.640]   take any chances there. Yeah. Okay, cool. I really do think I can't think of another
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:37.120]   parallel set of upgrades to an iOS 8 and Yosemite where I don't think there's a lot of danger
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:42.160]   involved, but this is like it's not difficult. It's like swapping out the doorbell on your front
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:47.360]   door where you have to do their ways to do to really it's a simple thing, but you have to
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.920]   really take steps to make sure that you're not screwing things up as you go. Like you have to cut
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:58.640]   part of the house just in case this will screw up. It's I really have set aside when I when I
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.720]   I'm telling people I haven't upgraded to Yosemite yet are my real computers yet. It's not so much
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:07.520]   a vote against the stability of the operating system, which is fairly stable. There are problems,
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:11.520]   but first month there are there are going to be problems. You don't. That's not unusual.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:17.200]   It's more like I want to make sure lately. I'm sorry, better better comparison is I had to change,
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:23.280]   you know, the the the the valve for the water flow for your the cut off valve for your washing
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:29.200]   machine. It's an easy thing to replace, but I had to I went without a washing machine for about two
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:35.280]   or three weeks because I felt as though I needed to book an entire day of my time because if
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:40.480]   everything goes well, this will take me 20 minutes to do. If anything goes wrong in any of these steps,
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:45.600]   I'm going to need the rest of the day available to fix it and leave the water to the house turned
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.040]   off until I go get that part and braise a new component in someplace else. These upgrades are
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:56.640]   pretty much the same way. If you if things if nothing goes wrong, it's easy 20 minutes painless.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   You'll have a really great time. You'll enjoy these new features, but if you screw things up,
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.720]   you're going to see you're going to wonder, huh, where did all the pictures with my of my newborn
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.040]   kid being born on the first on the first day last last year go away? It's not on my phone anymore.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.480]   You have to pretty much walk yourself through the process so that you're sure that you're in
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   control of everything and that any disaster that might happen is going to be either totally
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   mitigated or something that you're willing to accept for the virtuous application of iOS 8 and
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.120]   and Yosemite. One thing that's really cool though about all the stuff that didn't happen in the past,
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.880]   you know, previously you'd have iOS updates and you'd have Mac updates. But for things like
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.920]   extensibility and continuity, there is one manager who did who's in charge of both features across
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.720]   iOS and the Mac and they shipped them for both iOS and the Mac. And if you go if you go to the
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.360]   developer page and you watch some of the sessions, like I think Ian Berd and Aki, I'm forgetting his
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.240]   last name, gave a session on extensibility. You see how they did it the same on iOS and on the Mac,
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.920]   even though it was probably easier to do it one way on one system and one on the other,
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.960]   so that not only can developers develop the same extensions and the same, you know, make their apps
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.840]   do continuity together, but everyone has the same way of using it. A widget is a widget on iOS and
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.480]   it's on OS 10. And that's that same halo effect we were talking about earlier where it's not exactly
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:13.920]   the same, but it feels familiar. It feels comfortable. And I think that is one of the strengths of doing
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.240]   the updates the way they did them this year. Do you recommend? It sounds like Andy says saying
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:27.760]   don't rush. My take would be there's nothing there's probably no reason for you to make sure you get
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.480]   this get it done this weekend. I think there's always a good reason to wait one month one calendar
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.960]   month 30 days after the any major operating release Mac Windows Android anything just to make sure
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.680]   that when you do your Google search three weeks in you see what all the show stoppers are and you
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.600]   realize that oh this one app that I really desperately need is not compatible so I better hold off
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.640]   longer. And then when you do do it again, make sure it's not the sort of thing where I've got 30
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.880]   minutes to do this before I need to grab my phone grab my Mac book and head to the airport for my
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.680]   week in Hawaii because it's possible that at the end of 20 minutes you will not have working stuff
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.400]   and now you will not have a phone for your week long trip. So make sure you're doing it on a day
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.640]   when if you have to sit and troubleshoot things for a couple hours or make a trip to the Apple store
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.320]   that's a day that that's a good day to plan it out again. It's not an emergency situation. This
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.160]   is not the sort of thing that will keep oxygen flowing to your to your to your your aunt in the
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.480]   hospital. So you don't need to do this right away. Pick a day and make sure that you can get this
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.600]   done the way you want it done. If you're a developer, you need you need to update because you're making
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.440]   apps for these systems. If not, you're doing it because you want to and then it depends on your
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.920]   pain tolerance and your nerd level and all the other factors. All right, we're going to take a
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.680]   break. Come back. There's lots more to talk about. We'll do a speed round with some of the big stories
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:49.520]   including China hijacking iCloud users. But first a word from Squarespace, the place we go to make
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.520]   our inside Twit blog. Many of you go. It is the best web hosting plus the best content management
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.120]   system software and hosting tightly integrated to give you a remarkable experience, the best
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:07.760]   place to make your next website. You don't have to be a guru of web technologies to appreciate
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.840]   Squarespace. Although if you are, they have a great developer platform. I think you'll just be able
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.560]   to tell if you look at the templates that they are kind of the most beautiful templates. They're
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.200]   constantly improving the platform too with new features, new designs, better support and all that
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.160]   happens automatically because they have both the software and the hosting. You'll start if you
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:33.200]   click the get started button on Squarespace.com. You'll start with 25 beautiful templates, all of
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:39.040]   which have the latest state of the art features built in. Full bleed photos if you want.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.040]   Mobile responsive design. You don't have to worry about what size screen it looks great on any
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.920]   size screen. I found a 30 inch display to 5K display. Actually, that's going to be pretty
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.400]   important, isn't it, going forward? You want to make sure your site looks good on 5K. Squarespace does.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.040]   Every site has e-commerce built in. They have some great tools. The logo creator tool is so cool.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.480]   You have access to all the Google fonts, more than 300. Even though everything is incredibly
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.160]   easy to use, if you want some help, Squarespace has live chat and email support 24/7 from their
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.680]   offices. They don't outsource this. Plus, there's a completely redesigned customer help site for
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:27.120]   access to self-help articles, workshops, things like that. E-commerce for every site. You can take
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:34.800]   donations on any template. That's great for nonprofits or cash, wedding, registry, school,
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.360]   fund drives. It's inexpensive. It starts about $8 a month. It includes a free domain name when
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.520]   you sign up for a year. Really, it's great for a bride and groom planning their wedding. That's what
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:50.480]   Mike's son and new daughter-in-law did. They had a great site on Squarespace. Really loved that.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.160]   Eight bucks a month. You can keep it going and keep taking those donations. They have apps for
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:05.120]   iPad and iPhone, the metric app, the blog app, the portfolio app for photographers. Hosting includes
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.200]   everything you need to get a great experience in your customer. More importantly, your visitors,

[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.640]   So, Apple has finally acknowledged something that's been going on for a couple of days.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.640]   When the iPhone started being sold in China, we're not sure who did this, but it seems to be
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:55.040]   the Chinese government. According to GreatFire.org, which is a non-profit monitoring group that monitors
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:00.880]   China's Great Firewall, it looks like Chinese authorities were using a man in the middle
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:07.280]   attack to harvest Apple IDs, iCloud IDs from Chinese users. When you went to iCloud.com
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:14.080]   in China, in many cases, not all, but in many cases, you'd get a site that looked like iCloud.com
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.320]   exactly, but it wasn't. You'd be handing your iCloud credentials over to whoever was doing
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.680]   this, presumably the Chinese authorities, and then getting into iCloud.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:30.080]   The most browsers would say there's a certificate error if you're using Safari or Chrome.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:37.600]   You'd see a certificate error or Firefox. In China, unfortunately, the most popular browser is
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:46.640]   called Chihu, and it does not have that warning. So, most Chinese users probably wouldn't know
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:54.000]   that their credentials are being harvested. Apple finally has made a comment in a support document.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.880]   They have confirmed they are aware of, quote, "The intermittent organized network attacks,"
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.680]   end quote on iCloud users. They're very cautious. They don't want to say it's China.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.320]   We can't really be sure it's China, although the documentation provided at GreatFire.org seems
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.040]   pretty conclusive. Here's the quote. Apple has deeply committed to protecting our customers' privacy
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:16.320]   and security. We're aware of intermittent organized network attacks using insecure certificates
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.280]   to obtain user information. That's a man in the middle. We take this very seriously.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:28.400]   These attacks don't compromise iCloud servers, and they don't impact iCloud sign-in on iOS devices
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.440]   because you're using Safari there, or Max running Yosemite using Safari.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:41.520]   But you need to make sure you're using browsers that monitor and will warn you if it's an invalid
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:48.560]   certificate. If you see that certificate, you shouldn't proceed. They do have a way you can
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.080]   verify it even if you're using the Chihu browser. Nobody's saying it's a Chinese government,
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:02.080]   but I think it's pretty clear that it is. China does not really want... Apple does really not want
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.560]   to piss off China at this point. They're just saying, "Me, we notice this is happening."
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:14.880]   If you want to look at this in a positive light, that's good advice for anybody who's using iCloud
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.920]   on any service because if there's a vulnerability in China, it's probably a vulnerability everywhere.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.960]   Well, in fact, there's an asking Microsoft as well.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.440]   Yeah, exactly. I don't have Gmail.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:31.920]   Yeah, exactly. It is an interesting question. I don't think that Apple, whatever,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.360]   compromised the safety of its users to protect a business relationship with a government,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.040]   but they would certainly have to put a lot of effort into figuring out what gold do we want
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.160]   to achieve in responding to this and what is the best solution that protects our users,
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.640]   gets the message out there, and yet doesn't unnecessarily set fires where we don't need fires
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.320]   to be set right now. I mean, you can pretty much assume that... I'm going to read between the lines,
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.400]   but it makes sense that the iPhones out, Chinese authorities note that it's very hard to get into
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:10.800]   the material on the iPhone. So what better way to do it than to compromise somebody's iCloud
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.080]   login information than you always have access to their iCloud backups, and you can read those.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.480]   Well, we remember with Blackberries, they wanted to prep Squid servers to intercept the traffic
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.640]   because they couldn't get into the NOC system. This is not a surprise.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.040]   And there are way... The real problem is if you're in a non-sophisticated user,
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.920]   sophisticated users will immediately recognize what's going on and fix it.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:40.960]   And you're right, Andy. This applies to everybody. If you see that error, you should bail.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:53.520]   I'm getting a retina iMac, the 5K iMac on Friday, so we'll have a review next Tuesday.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.440]   Mine's taking longer to get here. Did you see it when you were at the event? Yes. Tell me. Tell me,
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:06.400]   do Leo, I wanted to dive inside and live there. Ridiculously, the blacks are so black, the colors
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.160]   are beautiful. They're doing this wizardry because if you don't externalize the connector, you don't
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.000]   have to follow the standard. You're free to break the rules. So they're taking two of the Display
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.080]   Point 1.2s and putting them together in their custom timing controller, and that lets them push
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.440]   all those 5K of pixels. I didn't see any stuttering. I didn't see any slowdown. They went all the
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.520]   way through iPhoto. They went through Final Cut Pro. It was just glorious. Great angles of view.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.720]   I wanted one immediately. And you ordered one? Yeah.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.440]   I was with the bumped up in graphics card because I do worry about the retina
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.720]   tax whenever there was a new retina machine. So I got the master graphics. I was buying it for
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:55.040]   my sweetheart, not myself. So I bumped it up all the way. I turned all the knobs to 11.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.160]   So the one thing about this is that a lot of people bought Mac Pro's hoping to get an Apple
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.760]   5K display. Yeah, I'm kind of pissed. Yeah. Well, Apple can't make a 5K display because not only
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.960]   is Broadwell not shipped yet, but Broadwell is not going to support it. You have to wait till
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.920]   Skylake, I think, which is going to have a Thunderbolt 3 on it. And by the time that comes out, the
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.000]   Mac Pro that you have still won't have Thunderbolt 3 on it. So it's not a great situation for that.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.120]   Marco, Marco Armand, we're a great piece on his Marco.org site,
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:30.320]   which kind of depressed me because basically he's saying, I'm thinking I should sell my Mac Pro
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.720]   and buy the Retinai Mac. Guy English called it his cylinder of shame.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   I'm hearing that from a lot of folks. But a lot of people, the reasons why people bought a Mac
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.240]   Pro are easily covered by a Retinai Mac and in many ways exceeded by a Retinai Mac.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:55.280]   Given that if you have a Mac Pro that doesn't have drive bays in it, then you start well,
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.400]   then what do I need it for?
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.320]   Do it. Get a good back be going.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.920]   The video editing, you're still better off with the Mac. I'm not doing video editing.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.560]   I just want a 4K display. I wanted to I have three monitors, 227 is a 4K display.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.080]   You can't do that with the new Mac. The iMac can only drive one 4K display.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.840]   It won't suit your three to three.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.200]   You know, it's really disappointing. I can't even buy the new iMac and hook it up to my Mac Pro
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.560]   and get a 5K display. No, because there's no Thunderbolt 3 out yet.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:29.760]   Right. Yeah. It's also as Marco points out, it has the fastest single core
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:36.560]   processor available to 4 GHz, if you get the i7, a 4 GHz processor compared to that crappy E5
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:46.480]   and my Mac Pro. They're not even on the hailing. Can we do an edit in which late 2014 Leo talks
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:53.440]   to the real that the Mac Pro is the best thing ever. And of course, we shouldn't be belittling
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.320]   the Mac Pro because the other unique feature of the Mac Pro is that the sky's the limit pretty
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:05.520]   much on cores. I mean, you can basically take a copy of the yellow pages, put it through a
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.960]   crosscut shredder, spread it on your driveway, take 100 pictures of it, throw it to your Mac Pro,
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.360]   and you've got enough processing power if you if you've maxed it out to basically do image capture
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.520]   and put it all back together again. But the thing is not a whole lot of people actually need that
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.480]   level of power, which is why I say that most of the people I think that were buying a Mac Pro,
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.120]   their needs are well served by the new iMac. Not me because I bought it for the wrong reasons.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.880]   Okay, but okay, well, would it be would you be happy having that 5k display behind your 60
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.560]   inch HDTV if you're using it as a living room server? No, you will.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.160]   I both Leo, you can have the Mac Pro and the iMac. You don't have to check this.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.640]   You're in the industry, man, you should. You owe it to your Oh, it's your I'm sure everybody in the
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.440]   chat room is going to is going to back me up on this. They're demanding that you have this.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.160]   And if not, I think Syracuse has a standing off or a $5 for anyone's back who wants to sell.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.560]   It's depressing when your girlfriend has a better Mac.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.560]   Leo, Leo, I'll double that.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.360]   I'll double that.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:10.960]   No, I'm very happy with the Mac Pro. I love it. The thing that kind of bugs me a little bit is,
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.520]   in order to get that beautiful Asus 4k display on there, it uses what is it called? MLS?
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.720]   Where it's basically splitting it into 220 or whatever.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.680]   MLC.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.920]   MLC, that's it. Two different displays. So they tear.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.040]   And even on Yosemite, I was hoping Yosemite, maybe they had, but there's no way to fix that,
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.160]   because it's the nature of the hardware, because there's so much bandwidth being pushed out there.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:43.520]   So, yeah, it's it's I think there could be the same problems with these first generation
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:50.560]   retinimax too, because there's so much stuff that Apple has never done before with this.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.360]   I'm just saying that to make me feel better, Andy.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.000]   I know.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.760]   I'm hoping to make you feel better, but I'm also at Leo.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.720]   More importantly, I'm saying this to convince myself not to buy one,
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.520]   which is almost just as important.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.560]   Well, we are going to review it. I'll benchmark it. I'll bang on it. I'll definitely,
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.880]   I'm going to try to prove it's not as good as my Mac Pro.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.800]   Just stare at it, Leo. You're just going to sit there staring at it.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.760]   It's that good, isn't it?
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.880]   Because it was a demo, you couldn't really test it. You know how fast it was.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.600]   No, they were moving the mouse around though. I mean, they were moving the pictures around the
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.800]   mouse around. They were fine.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.800]   This was not the Apple watch then.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.840]   The actual door. Apple watch.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.520]   It wouldn't actually streak if you touched it.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.080]   Can I just tell you, I turned up all the knobs, right? So I got the fastest I7.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   I got a, this was crazy, but she insisted a terabyte SSD.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:44.800]   I got, I didn't put 32 gigs of RAM, which is the top. I put 16. I think 16. Okay.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.920]   Roll the tape.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.000]   You only need 16 gigs of RAM is enough for anybody.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.040]   Humans only need 16 gigs.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.720]   I went with 16 as well.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.920]   But turned everything else up and it was four grand.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.000]   That's a lot of computer.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.920]   So less, so less than a dollar per K.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:14.880]   But 2,500 bucks is a remarkable deal.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.720]   That's basically the computer's free.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.640]   Yeah, but is that going to be really useful?
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.160]   Is that going to make people happy?
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.200]   Well, that's what I had.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.440]   I really been smart. That's what I should have bought
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.080]   for review purposes to see. Well, what is the base model?
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.840]   The Mac Pro, they managed to get the price down to a level where they could say it's that
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.360]   inexpensive, but it's like, it's also possible to buy Tesla S for what?
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:35.920]   Right.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.920]   $100, but nobody spent $60,000.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.320]   Right.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.080]   $60,000 on Tesla.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.440]   Now people have been waiting for retina max and I forget who said this,
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.240]   but you just, whenever you're waiting for a long time, you just buy the maxed out version.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.080]   Yeah. Why not?
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.880]   Never, never go grocery shopping while you're hungry.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.160]   So Marco's bottom line, who is the Mac Pro for?
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.840]   At this point, he says, not a lot of people, people who heavily use open CL apps.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.240]   That's graphics professionals video and 3D graphics professionals.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:12.880]   People needing as much parallel CPU power as possible for rendering or video editors
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.160]   and who can afford 8 or 12 cores, because I only got the 6 core.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.000]   Anyone using a lot of Thunderbolt devices, because they're what?
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.800]   4 or 6 Thunderbolt ports on it?
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.680]   Yeah, and 2 buses, I think, which is a port because you want the full bandwidth.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:25.920]   Right.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:33.200]   Anyone who needs a lot of monitors, well, maybe I qualify an HDMI output or 2 built-in network
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.080]   interforce faces.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.200]   I don't mean that.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.240]   People who need the quietest computer possible under any load.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.360]   And I'll agree on that.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.840]   The Mac Pro is, I can't believe how quiet it is.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:48.160]   It's so quiet that the external hard drive I have attached to it is making a racket,
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.240]   a ruckus, and turn it off so I can just
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.400]   rolls in which a kernel panic or other slight hardware glitch may be very costly.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.120]   What he's saying, that one is a little, I need to gloss that, which is because it's a new device,
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.880]   and it's not using this top of the line ECC memory and all that, it may be a little less robust.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.360]   Maybe once a year you'll have a kernel panic.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.960]   You have enterprise chips and enterprise RAM in the Mac Pro.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.000]   The list keeps getting shorter over time.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.520]   I think I finally fell off it.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.800]   So Marco, who has, I think, a little bit of money, but also as a developer, not a videographer,
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.520]   he's writing a new podcast app right now.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.560]   I think he's kind of right.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.760]   I think he's, I think, you know, that's all right.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.440]   You got, if you're going to be a leader, you got to take some arrows in the back.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:37.920]   There you go.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.640]   Why are the people behind me shooting at me?
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:41.920]   [laughter]
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:48.480]   It's also fun to watch how we all have to make transitions as to what we expect
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.880]   from a top of the line, really powerful computer.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.840]   It took me a long time, a stupid long time, before I switched to my Mac book as my primary
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.520]   computer, because I had programmed myself to believe that a computer is a desktop box that's
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.640]   shaped like this with a stack of other boxes on top of it.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.080]   And the power book is the thing that I just used to go out and do a new field excursions with.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.640]   And after it must have been two or three or four years of, no, actually my laptop is way more
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.920]   powerful than my desktop.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.000]   I should actually be moving everything onto this.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.680]   And it really was just that little bit of mental twist I had to do.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   I think a lot of people are having that same thing where I don't rely on an iMac.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.920]   The iMac is the family computer.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.200]   I'm a professional.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:39.760]   By the way, on Yosemite and iOS 8, there was some concern that the spotlight suggestions feature.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   By the way, I stopped using Quicksilver.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.720]   Alfred, any of those, just Command Plus.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.800]   I love the new spotlight search.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.960]   I just starting, I just start typing.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.760]   It will not only launch a program or a document, but it will search for movie show times,
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.360]   locations nearby.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   It'll search my iTunes, the app store.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.080]   I mean, it's great.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.440]   It's great.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:06.320]   But there is some concern that some of that information is being sent back to the home office.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.520]   So Renee, you've written an article at imore.com.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.400]   It came out yesterday.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:15.600]   Tell us, is there privacy concern and what should we know is going on here?
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.000]   Which would--
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.240]   So it's easiest to make an analogy.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.120]   So for example, if you're using Siri, it's providing convenience.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.600]   And convenience, like Steve Gibson always says, is the opposite of security and privacy.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.800]   So in order to get answers from Siri, you've got to give it information.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:33.760]   And the new spotlight is not identical to, but it's very similar to a type written form of Siri.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.560]   You're inputting things there and it's trying to do all these helpful things.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.640]   And part of that is based on your location.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.000]   Part of that is based on the sequential inference Siri does,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.520]   where if you type in, I think the example they used is cafe and then phone number,
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.120]   it's going to be predisposed to help you find phone numbers for a cafe,
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.800]   because that was your recent pattern.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.120]   And to do all that, it has to do similar things to Siri.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:57.360]   That is to go to the network and try to do some intelligence to parse it back down.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.560]   Apple explains this fully.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.240]   If you go to the settings on iOS or if you go to the system preferences on the Mac,
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.720]   and you tap on what is spotlight suggestions,
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.480]   it tells you exactly what it is.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.560]   The security document covers how it does this.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.280]   For example, it has a unique ID for 15 minutes,
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.080]   then destroys it.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.480]   It doesn't save anything in between these sessions.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:17.920]   It does a ton of stuff to try to maintain as much privacy at blurs,
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.280]   location, which is more effective if you're in a sparsely populated area
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.200]   than a densely populated area.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.640]   But it's basically things like this.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.160]   You're gaining all this functionality,
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.760]   but the expense of Apple having to do a little bit of processing on the server.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   Some people would have preferred for it to be opt-in instead of opt-out.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.160]   But there's some concern, I think, at Apple and everywhere that we're getting pop-up fatigue.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.560]   That when you set up, there's far too many windows already.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.840]   When you launch something, there's far too many pop-ups already.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.840]   I'm not speaking for Apple because I don't know.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.720]   But my thinking is that Maps knows your location because it's giving you locations.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.080]   We're all used to Siri now.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.880]   They're assuming that you know if you're getting these services,
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.480]   that it's a two-way street and you can go turn it off if you want to.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.240]   So when you first hit command space, you'll get the spotlight search,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:10.000]   but you also get the information you're looking for and a link to this document,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.800]   which explains exactly what's going on and says if you don't want your search queries
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.560]   and spotlight suggestions usage data sent to Apple, you can turn it off.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.880]   And then they have a link right there.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.920]   So I don't think Apple could do this any better, frankly.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:28.240]   And I think it's not unreasonable to assume that if you're asking for movie times,
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.480]   your computer doesn't know that.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.600]   It has to go query somebody.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.880]   It has to find out where you are so it can provide the movie times near you,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.640]   not in the Nova Scotia or so on.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.440]   So I think you can assume that users are not going to be completely what.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.120]   And I think spotlight is one of the best features of Yosemite.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.440]   It's the thing that I keep coming back to and I just love it.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.920]   For exactly the reason we've been talking about that,
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.840]   I've always been a little bit bummed out that the finder is still pretty much the
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:02.400]   finder that I've been using since 1984. And I do so much of my life, my interface with
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.960]   your Mac is just through launching things through spotlight.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.640]   And now that it can actually be that one box that will figure out what I wanted to do and then
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.560]   figure out how to do that, I want to see that just I just want to see them build upon it and
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.680]   build upon it and build upon it until like far exceeds what Siri could do.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.400]   Good. Yeah.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.480]   Yeah. I completely agree with you.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   It was just unfortunate that Washington Post had an article on it that sort of made it sound
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.520]   all panicky and scary.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.120]   You know, this is a it's link bait as far as I'm concerned.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.720]   Even the post should should know better. Of course, remember who owns the Washington Post now,
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.400]   but it's link bait.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.640]   Jeff Jarvis calls it moral panic.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:40.240]   Well, you can do technology, children and women, watch out.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.480]   And they scare you instead of educating you.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:49.120]   Yeah. And the journal does it. It seems like the New York Times has been doing it.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.000]   Respected journals that should know better need to do a better job of education and
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   not do this scare stuff.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.720]   It's just but it sells, you know, clicks or papers or whatever.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:00.960]   It's not.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:07.200]   Well, we transact in the currency that's far more viable and that is the listeners trust.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:07.840]   We care.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.680]   Yes, we do.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.760]   Couple of articles.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:17.120]   I mean, we might drive cars with 173,000 miles on them, but we have integrity and
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.160]   windows that don't really roll up. So we have to tape off the winter.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.000]   But still we have integrity.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:22.960]   Oh, I'm in trouble.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.560]   I have a couple of articles. I'm going to recommend you read.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:30.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, I already told you about the local man uses apple pay.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.840]   That's it.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.720]   Jason Snell's new home six colors.com excellent article in the business insider.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.840]   I mentioned it on Twitter.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:46.400]   Dave Smith tells the story of how Seth Winetrap founded nine to five Mac while he was
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.120]   stranded in Paris and how he found Mark Gurman and how he pays them.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.640]   It's just if you're, you know, we quote nine to five Mac, especially Mark all the time now,
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.800]   because they're just really good.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.400]   By the way, they quote you in that.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.560]   I don't think I came off as neutral.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560]   I get along really well with Mark and Seth.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.200]   So I'm decidedly happier than new.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.520]   You don't mind how effective nine to five Mac is.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.960]   You're in competition with them, but you have even competition is strong.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.080]   Like I am more than happy from Mark to do all that stuff.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.280]   It only benefits me.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.480]   I mean, you know what?
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.360]   I do other stuff.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.760]   We had Steve Kovac who's the executive editor there, a senior editor at the business insider.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.240]   You know what he said?
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.520]   He said he's one of the reasons people like Gurman can do it.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.400]   They have no fear.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.280]   They're 20 and they don't care.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.480]   He said Mark Gurman will never get invited to an apple event and he doesn't care.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:44.240]   And so there's a certain advantage when you're 15, 16 years old as Gurman was when he started.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.600]   You don't mind biting the establishments of hand because well, you're a kid.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.360]   I wouldn't put it that way.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.960]   It's more like I think everybody who wants to have a career or excuse me,
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.440]   wants to at least for this year do a good job.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.000]   The great thing about this line of work is that we get to decide what kind of job we want to do.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.320]   And if my job does not require me to be able to tell a month in advance what exactly what
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.160]   apple is going to be announcing about sober.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.440]   So I don't I've never bothered cultivating those kind of resources.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:19.600]   I don't have if if I tripped my fell ass backward into hardcore information like that,
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.160]   I might even be more prone to simply hand it to somebody else who has more experience and
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.840]   confirming and exploiting stuff like that.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.920]   He's mark is really great at that.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.360]   He obviously has a great interest in it.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.920]   So he gets to define the job that he wants to do and how best he can serve his users.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.240]   And he's obviously serving his readers very, very well.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.200]   Yeah, we're very happy to repeat his scoops where he is often accurate.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:41.680]   Exactly.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.400]   But like you, Andy, let's circle back for just one second.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.680]   That's exactly the point.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.160]   The fact that he has it's not that he has these scoops,
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.400]   it's that he has these scoops and he's consistently shown to be correct.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:54.800]   Right.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.520]   And that's the sort of we joke about I was joking about how, oh yes, we've got integrity, but
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.400]   really that's the thing you really want to build that a relationship with an audience that over
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.680]   the years people know that well, if Andy said this or if Mark said this or if Leo said this,
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.000]   this is what I assume is about this.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.320]   This is what I believe about this information and for them to believe that this is good information
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.160]   to have because this is this person's track record and talk about stuff like that.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.960]   And I think you're, I don't get invited Apple events either, but it's not because I don't,
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.280]   because I want to keep on Apple's good side that I don't do that stuff.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.120]   It's just not, it's like you, it's not my beat.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.320]   I like to talk about what you can get today and how it's going to impact your life and how you use
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.800]   it and stuff like that. And, but the God bless Mark Herman and the others who are so good at
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:46.080]   getting these scoops and, and accurately, because it's fun to, it's fun to know ahead of time and
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.600]   think about it and speculate about it. And our audience certainly cares. So great article, recommend
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:57.200]   it. And then the other one that we also talked about on Sunday, but I want to recommend again.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:03.040]   Judith Newman's article in the New York Times, "To Siri with Love, How One Boy with Autism
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:12.240]   Became BFF with Apple's Siri." And it's a really pretty sweet story by Gus's mother.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.640]   And he talks to Siri, says things like, "You're a really nice computer."
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.200]   Siri says, "It's nice to be appreciated. You're always asking if you can help me. Is there anything
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.920]   you want? Thank you. But I have very few wants." You got to pat the Siri programmers in the back
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.400]   for this stuff.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.400]   It's amazing. My God, someone who was three years old would use Siri to send and receive
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:35.440]   eye messages. He couldn't read. He couldn't write, but he could totally engage in dialogue. It was
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:41.120]   phenomenal. It's incredibly inclusive and accessible. Gus goes, "Okay, well, good night.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:48.000]   Siri goes, "It's 5.06 p.m." Gus says, "Oh, sorry. I meant goodbye. See you later."
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.360]   I mean, I know that this is written. It's hard-coded in and all of that, but pretty cool.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.920]   That's always been the goal that none of us are under any impression that Siri is a real
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:07.360]   person inside our phones, but it is designed so that we maintain this emotional connection to it.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.600]   That doesn't mean that this becomes like her or anything like that, but you feel as though
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.160]   this is a piece of information that I need to get, and I trust this voice and this personality to
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:24.560]   give it to me. And I'm also going to enjoy the process of finding out what 120 percent of $49
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.880]   and 12 cents is rather than simply launching a tip calculator to get that calculation.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.480]   She writes, "Of all the worries the parent of an autistic child has, the uppermost is
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.640]   will he find love or even companionship somewhere along the line, I am learning that what gives
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:46.560]   my guy happiness is not necessarily the same as what gives me happiness. Right now, at his age,
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   a time when humans can be a little overwhelming even for the average teenager,
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.760]   Siri makes Gus happy. She is his sidekick. I think that's just so sweet.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.440]   If you haven't read that, that was in the Sunday paper, Sunday, New York Times, and
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.200]   it's just great. You can read it online as well. It's terrific. Yeah, really.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.000]   All the accessibility technologies they're doing are amazing in many different ways.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.360]   It really is impressive. All right, let's take a break. We got to get your picks and then
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.280]   security now is coming up in just a few minutes. So I want to get to that.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:21.680]   Shutterstock.com are sponsored for this portion of Mac Break Weekly with over 42 million. Actually,
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.840]   I should go to Shutterstock because they have more than a quarter million every week. So every
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:34.720]   time I do this, it's more. The last time I checked, it was, let's see, it's 43,553,518 royalty-free
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:40.720]   stock images. 300,000 added this week alone. That's just the images at Shutterstock.com. Go
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:49.200]   there, click the footage tab. You'll see beautiful images, high def video, 2.1 million of those.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:56.960]   And now they've got music. They've got stock audio clips as well, high quality tracks.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.320]   And these are everything they do. And by the way, you could sort of buy mood, by genre, by tempo.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.760]   Even beats per minute, isn't that cool? And all of this stuff is what we call royalty-free.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.640]   That means you buy it and you can use it on your blog, your podcast, your movie. I see movies all
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:18.320]   the time now that I'm aware of it, where they'll be in the credits thanks to Shutterstock.com,
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:24.480]   the blue sky footage or whatever. It's pretty amazing. I want you to visit Shutterstock.com.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:28.560]   You don't have to have a credit card to sign up for an account. I would recommend you do
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.240]   sign up for that free account because you'll get free content every week. Plus, you'll have the
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:37.280]   ability to save images to the light box, share the light box with other people. They're trying
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.920]   out those amazing search tools that lay you search by subject, by color, by palette.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:48.720]   So you can match it to your palette of your blog or your magazine, your file type gender,
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:56.800]   emotion. Yeah, emotion. I love Shutterstock. They have a beautiful iPad, Webby award-winning.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:01.600]   They now have an Android app as well. So what I'd like you to do is just sign up for the free
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.040]   account. You don't need a credit card for that. But if you do decide to buy, I've got a great deal
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.800]   for you. If you're looking at one of the image subscription packages, for instance, we have the
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:17.040]   25-images-day package. That's suitable for a publication. But if you want to buy it as subscription
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:24.480]   package, you're going to get 20% off if you use our offer code MACBreak1014. That's Shutterstock.com,
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:32.080]   20% off any image subscription package on a new account when you use the offer code MACBreak1014.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:40.080]   Just browse around and have some fun. Shutterstock.com. Time for our pick of the week. Let's start with
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:46.400]   Renee Ritchie. I have two small ones. I say small only because the new extensibility and widget
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.080]   features make it seem like they're little applications, but they can still do big things.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:55.280]   The first one is Flare Effects. It's an app that's been updated by the icon factory.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:00.160]   Previously, if you wanted to work on, they are terrific. They do Twitterific and a bunch of other
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:06.240]   great apps. Xcode. So many great apps. Previously, you had to actually leave photos, go open up another
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:12.720]   app, work on it, save it, go back. It was arduous, but now extensibility means that all the filters go
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:18.400]   straight into the Photos app. You can, on iOS at least, it's basically you download the app. It
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.240]   tells you a little bit about it, but then all the functionality lives in the Photos app.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:27.280]   On the Mac, it's still an app, but basically it lets you do things, sort of like other filter apps,
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:33.680]   but with typical icon factory awesome interface and very tasteful filters. So it's just a really
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:39.760]   nice way to take advantage of all the new photo functionality that has come to iOS 8 and to some
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.160]   extent to Yosemite. We'll have to wait till the Photos app launches to get all of it. But it's
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.080]   excellent if you just want to make your photos look really good. Both Craig Haughtonberry and
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.320]   Geddy and Mayhood, everyone at the icon factory has been posting images using this. They look
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.680]   really, really good. The neat thing about this, I know it's kind of cheating, but you're just
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.320]   going to, you get addicted to the praise you get from people who say, "Oh, you're a great photographer."
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.400]   Oh, that's a great image. And you go, "Yeah, you know, don't tell anybody. You just, you know,
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.720]   you use flair and you just dress it up." And it saves images. Like you can use the effects to
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:14.320]   make an image that's not exactly what you wanted. Maybe you wouldn't have posted. You can just save
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.920]   it enough that you're willing to put it up there and that's a memory you can't get back.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:24.160]   Right. I mean, I'm not kidding. You could take a crap photo and make it good. And you go, "Oh,
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.920]   wow." I mean, I like the tilt shift. That's really fun to play with.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.040]   Yeah. And especially if you're just going to, not just, but if you're going to post to Instagram
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.280]   or social networks where it's on the screen, yeah, you don't need the huge resolution.
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:41.200]   Now this is a desktop app, $15. Oh, it's both. So you can get flair as well on iOS.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.440]   Yeah. And on iOS again, on iOS 8, it just lives inside the photo app. Once you download it,
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.640]   it tells you how to use it. But then you go to the photos app and you press the button and
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:53.520]   the extensions just come up. I'm getting that. So convenient. Yeah. The other one is also really
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:59.040]   small. I've been a longtime fan of iStat, which is the thing that lets you know all about your
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:03.200]   computer. And I'm a friend of Mark Edwards, but I was buying a software long before I met him.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.000]   And now he's got iStat Mini, which is a version of the iStat menu system, but it just lives in
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.760]   the notification center today view on Yosemite. So instead of having to go and look at all the
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.760]   different dials, you can just see the three most common ones right there. So you can see your
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:23.040]   processor load and your available disk space. All you do is swipe. The notification center
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.800]   today view comes out. Take a quick glance at it. You get the information you need and you close
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:32.480]   it again. And it really is that sort of glanceable thing that I think the thing I like about how
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.640]   iOS is doing and is that it's not on a home screen. It's not on a dashboard. It's not on a separate
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.960]   page. You don't have to again, leave what you're doing, go and find it. You just swipe and either
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.760]   notification center comes down from iOS or across on Yosemite. And it's right where you are. You look
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.920]   and then you go back. And I think glance ability will be the same thing on the watch. But it's all
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:53.840]   about pushing interface to where we are. So we don't have to go hunting around anymore. And I
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.040]   think we're going to see a lot of really exciting stuff because of that. By the way, it's flare
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.640]   effects by the eye conflict. If you're searching for on iOS, there's another thing called flare.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:09.840]   And it seems like it's free on iOS. Is that must maybe it's in app purchases? Yeah, I believe so.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:13.040]   I've been using the free version. Although if I knew I could give them money, I would certainly
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:20.800]   have done some. Yeah, that's awesome. Andy, Enoco, your picks Oda Week. Two things. One is that NASA
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:27.280]   in the past week. I opened a sound cloud page and they're loading it up with just like clips of
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:33.280]   like missions, mission dialogue and rocket sounds and historical speeches and just like chatter
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:40.640]   between the ground and Apollo and space shuttle and all this sort of stuff. And I found the link.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   I opened the link. I played the first one to hear it. And then I found myself just like listening
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:53.200]   to the entire load from the start to finish. That's my favorite. That's from the Mercury series.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.360]   But there's President Kennedy. There's Apollo. This is a good one. And there sounds it's just like
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.800]   rocket.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:15.440]   What is it about these? I tear up. I love these because thousands of people helped three people get
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:20.480]   a quarter million miles away at an incredible thing that you keep that this animal that we are
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   not supposed to do. Yeah. So it's free. It's soundcloud.com/nasa. And if you have a sound
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.800]   cloud account, you can add them, follow them and get new stuff when they put new stuff up.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.680]   It's just amazing. It's like I spotted at least 11 ringtones.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:40.800]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Because, you know, the music is boring. Just just give me all that.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.320]   Sally Ride say that's a really ticket. Like, okay. It's just great.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:53.600]   So for non inspirational non-story things, Amazon has is now picking orders on the Kindle
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.840]   voyage that pre-orders are starting to ship right now. And it is the best e-reader that
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.840]   Amazon has ever made, which means that in my opinion, it's the best e-reader that exists.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.680]   There are a lot of little tweaks they've done. The hallmark ones are that they've increased the
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:15.600]   density of the screen to 300 dots per inch from 212. Now the dots are so small, you just can't
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:22.960]   see them. And it's just almost a demonic effect when you just see these printed, clearly printed
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.960]   pages, if thing before your very eyes, they've increased the contrast too. So the effect is even
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:35.040]   better. They've also redesigned it so that there's no longer like that gap, that little divot, excuse me,
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:41.360]   the bezel is no longer raised around the display. It's not one flat sheet of glass. So it's very
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:46.240]   familiar to people who are using phones and tablets. But also they've put, if you can see on the sides
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.720]   here, now that they're now they're pressure sensitive buttons for page forward and back on both sides
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.640]   of the screen so it works if you're left to your righty. So now instead of having to like mark up
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.040]   the screen and be doing this and be tapping and squeezing on different sides, you can just like
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.160]   hold this very, very comfortably with one hand and just give it a very gentle tap or very gentle
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:09.360]   squeeze. There is a silent haptic buzz underneath your finger to confirm that you've done it,
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.800]   you've done a page turn. And overall it's, and there, I won't go through all the different
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:20.240]   features because there's all kinds of really cool exploration and information services that
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:25.600]   are attached to each of these books and all content in there. But overall, it's just so much more
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:31.440]   pleasant to read a book on this or even a Kindle paper white than on an iPad by the virtue of the
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:36.880]   fact that this was designed to only be a book reader. So it's not big, it's not heavy, it's not
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.720]   shiny, it works great in all kinds of light that you can actually use. And kind of reminded me,
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:48.000]   I haven't read a book on a Kindle since the last time I had to review a Kindle and it kind of made
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.840]   me think, gee, you know, maybe I should buy one of these for myself because I read the Martian
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:59.280]   from cover to cover for the first time on this device last week as I was reviewing this and
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.360]   cannot remember the last time that I had such a enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed this experience.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:11.280]   And I read lots of books on my iPad all the time. So it's not the iPad or the Android tablets or
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.600]   phones, it's not like they're bad devices, but they're designed to do a lot of different things
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:21.360]   among them being to run a book reader app. This is designed to absolutely pander to
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.960]   and kiss the butt of anybody who loves to read. And it's so much better in every way.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:32.000]   It's not cheap. It's 200 bucks, the cheaper version of it compared to, I think, $120 for
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.960]   the Kindle paper white, which in itself is not still not a bad reader doesn't replace it as the
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.960]   Kindle product line doesn't replace it. But boy, if you've got an extra $80 in your pocket for any
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.160]   book reader, the extra resolution on that display just pushes this over the clip.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:53.440]   So Chris, also the page turn is much faster and not nearly as annoying.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.080]   Yeah. And when you when you type on the on screen keyboard, it's I can't it's still an
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.520]   E and display so can't quite keep up with you. But a lot. But it feels like this is this will
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.080]   sound like a like a slam, but it isn't. It feels like a first generation Android device.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.040]   Right. It's not it's not as good as an I as a modern iPhone, but you can start you're not you're
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.360]   not focusing on tap wait for the register tap for the you can actually go tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.560]   tap tap tap. You can even go through it. You can even like select and extend selection as you drag
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.720]   because it still has a full touchscreen on it. And it will keep up with your dragging.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:32.560]   And they've they've they've worked out the stuff that that I didn't like about or at least excuse me
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.040]   that I thought underperformed even with the Kindle paper white. And they even improved the
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:42.160]   things that I liked about the Kindle paper white. And there's just nothing like this if you do like
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:48.640]   to read stuff. Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited. Again, it's interesting to see the integration of
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:54.080]   Goodreads. I hadn't seen the Kindle new Kindle in a while. And Goodreads, which was a social
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.400]   reading network that Amazon acquired a couple of years ago. Now is a big part of it. So you can I
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:04.000]   just sign up to follow a few people and review some of the books that I've read. And that really is
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.760]   nice that yeah, I mean, a regular ding against Amazon products like the Kindle Fire is that,
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.320]   Oh, well, look, it's holes. It's all set up to get to encourage you to buy more things from Amazon.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.280]   And that's certainly true. But in a device like this, is that really a bad thing? It means that
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.000]   when I'm done when I was done reading reading the Martian, it was very, very easy for me to just
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.720]   simply in Goodreads, write the book share a couple of notes about it. And then immediately see what
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.120]   were my I want a new book to read? What are my friends reading? And then here's like nine really
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.520]   good candidates. Oh, this one that Scott McNulty just finished reading looks really cool. Click on
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:42.080]   that read the description. Great. I'll buy that. And then $10 later, it's now on the it's now on
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.640]   the device. And it's easy to chain smoke books on this because this will help you find the next book
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:50.960]   you want to read and then acquire it very, very easily and very, very simply. It's kind of like
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.640]   like you feel like a reader when you have this. You feel like you should be speaking. You want to
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:01.360]   like go on to Amazon and see how much like a pipe costs. No tobacco, just you just wanted to be,
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:07.200]   you know, I already have the smoking jacket. So I'm halfway there. If they got self adhesive leather
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:14.160]   patches, you can just put on your t shirt because I am I'm not just a reader. I'm a reader who read.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:20.160]   I read the books that I read. Thank you, Andy and I coach Chicago, Sun times always a pleasure.
