[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.700]   Here with us from youtube.com Renee Ritchie Ritchie Ritchie Ritchie Ritchie Ritchie Hello Renee
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   Hello Leo, I spent the whole night covering myths, busting myths, and now I don't know what's real anymore, so I need you all to bring me back, bring me back to reality.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.700]   Were you watching a Mythbuster's marathon?
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   I was making a Mythbuster, an Apple Mythbuster.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700]   Oh!
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.700]   I believe all the conspiracy theories, I can't tell fact from fiction anymore.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   You YouTubers stay up late. You're always working hard.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.700]   I know, my son, he'll say, be two in the morning saying, "I'm just finishing the video now."
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700]   That's gosh, okay, fine.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   I just want to have it up when the audience is there Leo, you don't want to have it up when the audience is going to sleep, so you have to sacrifice your sleep for the audience as awake.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   Are you talking about why Apple hates Nvidia?
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   I don't hold a bunch of stuff like that, yeah.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700]   Alright, yeah.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.700]   Myth's debunked.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.700]   All the conspiracy theories.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   Pahrennay, Riji.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   Tribia.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   Also with us from WG.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   B. H. in Boston.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700]   Andru.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   And not go.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   Hello Andy.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.700]   Hello, now the thing about with Umbrella Man is that he's wearing a wristwatch, so a wind hour that was not even made until 1967.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   Alright, explain that.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   One minute, 30 seconds in, our first Marvel reference, I believe. Is that Marvel? I don't know.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.700]   No, no, no.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   That's kind of the assassination, the famous...
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   Yes.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.700]   Someone was holding an umbrella.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   Oh, I thought.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.700]   I thought on the parade route.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.700]   And that was a signal to the Rosa Crucians and whoever that was the time to...
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   Oh.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.700]   I was thinking Umbrella Academy or something like that.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   No, the bullet stopped in mid-air Leo.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   It spun 180 degrees and then it went back into Kevin Costner.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   Explain that.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   And now...
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.700]   Oh, and without further ado, and we've got Alex Lindsey from 090.media.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   The Maven in charge of Office Hours. Hello Andy.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   I mean, Alex.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   Hello Andy.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   Alex.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   I'm flattered you would have to take him for me.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   Hello.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   As I am.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   Hello.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   Hello.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.700]   What did you do this morning?
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.700]   What did I do this morning?
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.700]   Oh, we talked about audio issues.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.700]   Oh, perfect.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   So we were just like, what are audio issues and how do we handle them?
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.700]   Perfect.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.700]   And so we...
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.700]   Our big excitement is we have a very long day on Saturday.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   We're taking a lot of the technologies everyone's been working on all year, taking over remote
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   locations, running a lot of the stuff in the cloud.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   And we're literally going to have cooking for one hour and then a concert and then another
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700]   concert and then a round table discussion.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   Sabata, Junciko.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   So all of those.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   Yeah, so we're kind of putting it all together.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.700]   We still...
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   We're still pretty excited, but we had Michael Krasni on last week.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   Oh my God.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700]   That's up on YouTube.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.700]   Amazing.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.700]   Michael Scray.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   He's amazing.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   He's as good to interview as he is to...
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   He is an interviewer.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700]   He's a really good interviewee.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   It's my experience.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   Like sometimes that doesn't work.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.700]   Well, I think if you're a good interviewer and you've had a lot of interviews and you know
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.700]   how bad it can go, then you become sympathetic.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.700]   It's like this is a little bit...
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   It was like every...
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.700]   Yes, no answer thing.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.700]   Oh, and also...
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   It's like he answers the question completely, but then stops.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.700]   Like as an interviewer...
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.700]   Exactly.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   You know that...
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.700]   He knows the time that I stop talking.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.700]   Sam, but...
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.700]   We should mention Krasni is probably not...
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.700]   No, it's probably not known around the world, but he's very well known in the Bay Area because he had a...
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.700]   Morning talk show on the public radio station for, I don't know, it's 20 years.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   Long time.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.700]   Okay.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700]   There is some news.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.700]   First thing first.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   I woke up this morning.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.700]   iOS 15.2 was here and Monterey.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.700]   Nice.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.700]   12.1 was here.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.700]   Is this...
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.700]   What's going on?
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.700]   Why do they...
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   Why do they update all at once?
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.700]   Is that the new thing?
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.700]   That everything gets updated all at the same time.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   They're so codependent now.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   Like they have so many features that are...
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.700]   Oh, they have to.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.700]   Trinsically connected that it's...
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   Well, it's easier if they do.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   Otherwise you're like, "Why it says if I update my notes, I can't use my notes on my Mac anymore.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   What am I gonna add?"
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.700]   It just all works and it's easier.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   I think each release has more or less in each one of those things, but it does because...
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   I think when they look at, "I'm gonna fix this one thing in this one place."
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.700]   I have to fix...
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.700]   They have to fix all the integrations with it.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.700]   So the update may be very minor for some of the other platforms for that specific update,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.700]   but they are continually tying closer and closer together.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   Yeah, it makes you wonder if Apple really needs to get rid of the regular update schedule
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.700]   where people are expecting an update at a single...
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.700]   Even during a certain quarter of the year, at some point they have to say,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.700]   "This will all be ready when it's ready.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   You will be getting updates throughout the year.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700]   You don't have to wait until..."
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   If we have a great update for notes, we're not gonna necessarily have to wait until October to get it.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.700]   If we have a great update for the camera app, you're not necessarily gonna have to wait until the next iPhone
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.700]   before we push all that out, because, like we're saying,
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.700]   there's so many codependencies here, and it's almost like an episode of the Goldbergs, really.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   Anything...
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.700]   I just important to report.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.700]   I guess I gathered when I joined you guys.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.700]   Andy was a little unhappy about the lack of something.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.700]   Yeah, a little salty.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700]   The best...
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.700]   Well, I'm just...
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.700]   I'm not mad at you, Apple.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   I'm just disappointed.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   Maybe we should...
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.700]   Maybe we should...
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.700]   No, it's a tough feature.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.700]   What's the full of feature?
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   Universal control.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.700]   That was the feature where if you just have an iPad or another Apple device within proximity of your desktop,
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.700]   Mac or your desktop, whatever, you can basically control all three with the same keyboard and mouse.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.700]   Like, you move the mouse pointer off to the right side of your Mac desktop,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.700]   and because it knows that your iPad is there and it's off to the right,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   it will just simply appear on your iPad and I were controlling the iPad with that keyboard and with that mouse.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.700]   And it was just...
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.700]   It was one of the reasons why...
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.700]   Well, I didn't need a whole lot of reasons to buy a new iPad Pro this year with the M1 chip,
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.700]   but that was one of the things that kind of sold it to me that, "Oh, man, I could integrate this so well
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.700]   with all the other stuff I'm doing."
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.700]   But it's a really great demo, and the better the demo, the tougher the technology is going to be.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   And they were supposed to be out this fall, and now they didn't really announce...
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   That was being delayed.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.700]   They just simply listed it on the MasterOS product page.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.700]   And, "Hey, here's this great feature that we're going to have out sometime next year."
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   Anyway, but here's how great it works.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:36.700]   Yeah, Parker or Ojolani on the 9-5 Mac is saying out loud, the things were all to polite to say out loud,
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.700]   which is, "Will universal control meet the same fate as air power?"
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   Really?
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.700]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.700]   Well, I mean...
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.700]   So, a couple things.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.700]   One is, I've said for a long time, I wish Apple would move away from the monolithic annual release
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.700]   and just say, "This is what we're doing for the next year.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   It starts this September, but we're going to be providing features for the whole year."
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.700]   But some people point out that that takes some of the pressure off them,
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.700]   and we're already seeing this stuff take three months to come out, and if they said,
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.700]   "Oh, it'll come out whenever they'll have even less incentive."
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.700]   Saying September means probably by March, and if they just didn't set any date ever,
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.700]   it could be by 2025.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.700]   And it's all conceived.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.700]   It's always good to have a deadline.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.700]   But air power was just physically, it ended up being physically impossible,
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.700]   and the people said they could do it were just constantly lying about it being possible,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.700]   and Apple even bought other companies.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.700]   They said, "Oh, we can do it for sure."
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.700]   They couldn't.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.700]   This is just a complicated feature.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   I use Sidecar all the time.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.700]   I'm editing Final Cut with a mini LED screen,
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.700]   and then I have a second mini LED screen to just watch the video on, and that's amazing.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.700]   And this is an escalation of that.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.700]   It can do even more than that.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.700]   I mean, within reason, you can drag and drop between devices, which is really, really cool.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.700]   But that sort of technology is just tricky, and I'm guessing that they're having bugs with it,
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.700]   and they'd rather not ship it and have people complain about it over the holidays,
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.700]   but just keep it and then release it when it's in a better state.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.700]   It's possible that it's in the, what I would call the Samsung stage of development,
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.700]   where it works, but it doesn't work flawlessly.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.700]   That's partly a slam at Samsung, but partly it's an admiration for it.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.700]   Look, this doesn't work perfectly, but we're not going to get it to work perfectly until we get people complaining about it
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.700]   and letting us know what's not working right.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.700]   Apple, to their credit, they will not release something with a rare exception.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.700]   They will not release something until it works, works, works, works, works.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:31.700]   Sometimes I kind of wish they, if there's a ropeiness tolerance of, let's say, 4.2%,
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.700]   if it doesn't delete data, if it will work for most people, and they will be able to say,
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.700]   "Oh, by the way, we're doing a public beta release," sort of speak.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.700]   We will let you use this, but it's not quite ready yet, but we want to see how people use it.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:50.700]   That might be a positive thing, but yeah, this is a tough one because this was like airpower.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.700]   It was like a big, big push, but I don't think that it'll go the way of airpower.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   We're talking, airpower, they're trying to do something that was really breaking the laws.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.700]   There are still rumors that airpower is still in process.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.700]   Well, the brand name, the brand name.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.700]   We're waiting for you.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700]   Exactly.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   Okay.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.700]   We'll get something out of this product.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.700]   But this never made it into beta.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.700]   That was the thing.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.700]   Like, Andy's point, like, unless it'd been in a beta and it was buggy and then they pulled
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   it from a beta and then it came back.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.700]   Like, that's one thing, but it never made it into beta, which makes you think that did
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.700]   Apple make it a mistake announcing it?
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.700]   In retrospect, absolutely.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.700]   If they can't ship it and they weren't able to put it into beta, that means that they were really,
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.700]   they had a lot of faith in the system that was not ready to even announce it.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.700]   I wonder how that happens.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.260]   I think the hard part is that your making announcements about something's going to be
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.700]   released in October in June.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.460]   It's just what can be things that just fall through that crack where with a bunch of other
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.460]   updates and a bunch of other things that they've done between now and then, there's a lot of
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.860]   things that can go wrong.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.740]   I think that this is falling probably into one of those handshakes and so on and so forth
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.700]   that are required to make it work.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   Of course, Apple, especially when you're rolling something new out, no one's missing it yet.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.340]   I mean, we're all like, "Oh, that'd be great."
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.700]   But it's not like our computer doesn't work.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   It's like, "This is a really cool little thing."
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.420]   What you don't want to do is put out something that's cool but not necessary and then have
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.620]   a whole bunch of people go on Twitter, "This doesn't work.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.460]   I don't understand."
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.820]   I think that they're going to be careful of making sure that it's really rock solid so
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.620]   it doesn't create a bunch of complaints on something that, again, somewhere in the future,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.500]   we may all be very addicted to it and couldn't live without it but we're not there yet.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.860]   We haven't tasted that yet.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.420]   We said other things like two of them.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.860]   They had this with HomePod where they announced HomePod and it looked great but then internally
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.540]   at Apple they realized that they had neglected Core Audio and AirPlay for years and that
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.300]   they were bugs and technical debt and real, really bad issues with those and they ended
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.140]   up having to write AirPlay 2 which was non-trivial and they ended up having to re-architect Core
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.340]   Audio which was non-trivial and that created a nice little two-month product wind down
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:03.340]   into a six-month sprint of marathons and that could have happened again.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.780]   The other way of looking at this is that when you're talking about a feature like Universal
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:15.140]   Control it's possible that you might have angered a bunch of people that will say, "Hey,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:21.780]   I bought the iPad Pro not because of Universal Control but it was something that double sealed
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.780]   the deal for me."
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.060]   But if you had a large organization that said, "Oh my God, our IT department has come up
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.060]   with this really, really incredible plan about how we will save money by switching everyone
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.740]   over from laptops to iPad to 10-inch iPads.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.700]   We invested $10,000, $20,000 into this and then like, "Oh, so the thing that you promised
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.220]   us is now vaporware."
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.620]   That's the sort of risk that you take when you play this long game like this.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.620]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.620]   I heard the break.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.620]   I was waiting.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.820]   I was waiting to see if you're going to cut us off or move on or whether we're going to
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.820]   talk about it.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.180]   But I think that I was trying to be a better citizen.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.620]   You've learned from Michael Krasney, obviously.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.620]   Yes, exactly.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.740]   Can I just say that Alex and I are really, really good for the kind of friends where
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.900]   if there's an issue, we will just have a quick chat and settle it very, very quickly.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.980]   So, let's give it to Andy a lot of space.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   Exactly.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.020]   So, a lot of love.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:28.700]   Anyway, so the, yeah, and I think that one of the things when it comes down to these
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:33.500]   pieces is that it is super complex like what they're doing.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.620]   And even things that have been out for a while, if you look at just my headphones knowing which
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.700]   Apple device, the problem is if you really get into Apple and you have lots of Apple
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.700]   devices, the headphones just can't figure out what they're doing.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.700]   And that's just audio.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.700]   That's just audio.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.060]   I have headphones that like I'm like literally the headphones are next to the phone.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.540]   All phone is the only one open.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.940]   They're in my ears.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.860]   Like I'm like, I don't understand why you can't figure out that this is the phone that
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.140]   I want to listen from.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.100]   And so, and that's something they had out for years.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.100]   You know, and it's still a problem.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.260]   And so the video is just another set of that and understanding where it is and how it
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.260]   works.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   So, I'm surprised.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.700]   I'm amazed that it works at all or that it potentially could work at all.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.060]   And I'm happy for them to just figure it out as best they can knowing that it's still
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.060]   going to be nasty when they send it out.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.940]   Microsoft has a phrase they use far too often.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.260]   It's a difficult computer problem.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.900]   And it may be that there are, in fact, I'm sure that there are some things and maybe
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.780]   Bluetooth handoff is one of them that are just, you know, intractable.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.780]   They're hard to solve.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.420]   In one company that I've worked with, it's called it's a non-trivial issue.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.900]   Non-trivial, exactly.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.340]   Non-trivial is that a couple of programmers announcing no matter what.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.340]   Oh, that's trivial.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.340]   Until they do it.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.340]   Slip a bit, Leo.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.340]   Slip a bit.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.340]   It's easy.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.340]   I can do that.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.340]   All right.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.740]   Well, you know, I mean, I'm not, I guess we're making a bigger deal out of it than it
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.740]   is.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.140]   No, no, it's just, I mean, share play for Mac ship.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.140]   So we got something.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.140]   Yeah, true.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.140]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.820]   I think the reason why we're talking about is it's so unusual for Apple to not ship something
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.540]   that they said was going to ship during a vague timeline.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.220]   So that just shows the track record of Apple.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.140]   And also, again, I think the level of quality that they aspire to before they're willing
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.140]   to release something.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.260]   You know, it's like when Tom Brady throws an interception.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.940]   It doesn't happen often.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.020]   So when it happens, you pay attention to it, but he still looks handsome.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.020]   All doing it.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.020]   He still looks damn good.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   This is the weirdest connection.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.500]   He's a very, he's a very handsome man.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.780]   Actually, that really makes it's analogy perfect because Apple looks good while they're
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.060]   throwing it in a reception.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.060]   They really do.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.060]   Right.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.060]   Right.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.060]   Right.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.060]   So there you go.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.060]   In fact, savagenious speaking of interceptions.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:51.020]   A lot of talk we did it this Sunday, but you know, I think we should do it now in the presence
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.980]   of actual Apple back in touch users.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:17:00.020]   Tech Dirt, Apple's Do Not Track button is privacy theater, Financial Times saying snap,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.180]   Facebook and others have gotten around this Do Not Track button.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:09.860]   All it really does is say you can't use the Apple ID for advertisers, but there's plenty
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.340]   other ways to fingerprint people.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:19.580]   People's allowing the ex filtration of quote anonymized aggregate information.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:25.140]   But as the Financial Times and Tech Dirt pointed out, we've seen lots of studies that show
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.980]   you can de-anonymize information given enough data points pretty easily.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:35.700]   And Apple is still letting things like how much batteries left, how much storage is left,
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.100]   you know, things like that leak out.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.420]   All of those can be used for fingerprinting.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.780]   So this is actually the most interesting article and this is more recent than the information.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.700]   And then I'll let you talk a whole second.
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.700]   Apple's empty threat question marks silence over iPhone ad work around so's confusion.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.300]   Apple has yet to respond, in other words to the Financial Times.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.420]   This is really good for Apple, this article.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.980]   And so because what Apple's doing, what Apple needs people to do is not complain about
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.220]   them being heavy handed.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.500]   They need them to complain about not moving fast enough because what they're doing is
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.180]   they're doing this slow snare.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.660]   Like they're just slowly moving around everything.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.460]   So they're starting to add all these little tools and they're just slowly tightening all
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460]   these little screws.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.860]   If you're ever in a high security event with Secret Service, one of the things they do
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.540]   is they, everything's easy to get into.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.940]   And then it's a little harder, then it's a little harder, then it's a little harder.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.100]   Like you just, you know, they keep on circling and they have a whole plan of how they're
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.540]   going to tie this all up.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.460]   But they're going to take nine square blocks and make them impenetrable, but not at once.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.020]   Like, you know, like those like, you know, and so.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:44.460]   It's like this, I mean, it's pretty clear now that turning off IDFA is not, is not sufficient.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.820]   But it's a start is what you're saying.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.820]   And it's a beginning of a slow swing.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.620]   And you're putting these little leverage points in and you're figuring out how they work and
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.700]   you're watching people, their behavior.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.580]   So you get to watch how they're going to, how they're going to manage what you're doing.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.940]   And you just slowly tighten this.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.340]   I'm sure Apple knows how to make it super secure if they wanted to.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.740]   But if they did that immediately, we'd have a bunch of lawsuits about how Apple's a monopoly
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.660]   and they're not letting people in and they're not letting them do all these things.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.420]   And, you know, they, this is going to ruin, you know, small businesses and put, you know,
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.460]   Peoria, Illinois out of business and, you know, all this other stuff, you know, that's going
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.460]   to happen.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.020]   And so, so what they do is they put, they're putting in the pins, you know, it's kind of
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.540]   like you put the pins in and then you just start pulling really tight, really, really
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.140]   gently in as you start pulling all those things in.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.260]   And so people are going to, what they need are articles like this that say Apple isn't
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.260]   really doing enough.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.660]   They could do a lot more because that gives you more leverage to do it.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.780]   Just keep pulling harder and you can just keep, but what they're doing is they're putting
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.460]   all the points of leverage in that they need to tighten this up because Apple doesn't have
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.780]   a business model around that data.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.700]   And so they, I mean, they have their own in-app for the iTunes or whatever.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.500]   But the thing is that they don't need any of this stuff.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.500]   They can just take things in a way.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   They don't have to.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.980]   They can have companies and apps, exfiltrate and fingerprinting information or end around
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980]   IDFA.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980]   And they are right now.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.580]   In fact, this is in the article I said, I said, Josh Cisco and the information.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:07.060]   They point out that a year ago, Craig Federighi said, hey, if apps don't comply with our privacy
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.220]   policy, we can yank them.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.980]   And of course they happen.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.100]   And you know, so we know that snap and Facebook and others end around, but Apple's done nothing.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.580]   But Apple, well, Apple's done nothing on the surface.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.740]   So what you're seeing is they get to see what other people's behaviors are.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.620]   They get to watch how their, how the companies are managing this and what they're doing to
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.860]   get around it.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.060]   And they get to slowly, and they get to make the next decision, but they don't have to
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.940]   make it all at one time.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:38.380]   And so the thing is, is that, and they're going to go fat slower than, you know, like
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.700]   this, you know, people are going to complain about it being toothless and everything else.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.940]   The thing is, if Apple did everything they were capable of doing, number one, is they
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.420]   wouldn't see some of the holes that are there.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.980]   Number two, is they'd have tons of lawsuits and complaints because it's going to change
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.980]   this industry as they keep on pulling this in, but they're doing it nice and slowly so
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.260]   that you don't have to, so they don't get as many complaints in what they want.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.820]   But this is, we should put a theory and we will figure out over time if it's true.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.060]   It is also the case.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.340]   There's no, there's a lot of ample evidence of this that these companies add tracking
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.740]   companies will go to the ends of the earth to find ways to fingerprint you and track
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.740]   you.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:21.700]   I mean, and so it's, it's not an easy thing to do to turning off the IDFA may not be much
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700]   at all.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.700]   But it's a start.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.700]   I don't think Apple knew what it was.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.980]   But also, well, I mean, the contrary, I argument is it's privacy theater.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:37.020]   In the information article, they say Apple made $4 billion in ad revenue last year, which
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.780]   is about what SNAP would be making.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.540]   I don't think these privacy issues, but I don't think the privacy issues would affect
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.660]   Apple's ad revenue because that's all inside their app.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.660]   No, it's first party.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:52.380]   Well, but that's also some of the hand waving is, and Google's doing this in spades, which
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.340]   is no third party tracking, but we're going to track the hell out of you.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.740]   So I mean, Facebook, Google and Apple and Microsoft and every all at first party information.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.380]   Yeah, but I don't know how much research valuable.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.380]   Sorry.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   Go ahead.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.660]   No, I was just, I was just going to assert that as possible that these articles are also
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.660]   bunk.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.060]   I mean, a large portion of technology journals in these days seems to go off the premise
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.820]   of can we do something gotcha and then fill in back fill in the facts to make whatever
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.860]   the most sensational headline possible.
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   And I really lament that.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.840]   I really lament like the prosecution of ideas and starting with a bunch of facts and seeing
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.180]   where they lead you because I have to say over and over again.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.260]   Okay, that may be true, but the information and the financial time though are pretty strong
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.260]   journal.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.260]   No, I disagree.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.260]   I disagree.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.260]   I think like Washington Post is bunk.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.260]   New York Times is bunk.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.140]   I think a lot of this stuff is people who don't deeply understand the technologies.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.340]   One of the problem and that's commonplace, but what Apple did was just say exactly what
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.820]   you said that you can no longer use the Apple's unique identifier.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   That's all this has ever been.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.460]   And app tracking transparency made no promises beyond you can only you can no longer use
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.220]   the unique identifier to track people when they leave your app or your set of apps and
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.220]   go into other apps that use your SDK or go out into the web.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.700]   And they as part of the announcement, they're like people are asking what about if they
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.700]   track us on the web.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.660]   They're like, we can't do anything about that.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.660]   It's an honor system.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.900]   If you tell them we don't want to be tracked, they should honor your request.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.100]   But we have no authority to police the internet.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.340]   This is a classic problem with doing a track in browsers.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.460]   Which is completely useless.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.260]   The browsers have it, but it's completely useless because nobody honors it.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.860]   I think it's Alex is correct in that.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.860]   It's oh sorry.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.860]   I was going to one last.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.860]   Please correct.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.220]   This also for Apple deflates a lot of what I'm going to call propaganda about how they're
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.420]   being so mean to advertisers because yeah, Apple is making revenue advertising in news,
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.900]   stocks and the app store, which is like the lamest, the worst advertising product in the
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.900]   world.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.060]   It's just that they're so big that they make a lot of money.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.060]   It's a scale thing.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.500]   It's not a quality thing or a reacherous scope thing.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.660]   Snap makes a fortune in their app.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.260]   It's just their app isn't so big anymore because the Kardashians left.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.700]   Apple can't fix that.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.220]   But I think a lot of this is just like, yes, it's going to deflate a lot of regulatory
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.940]   arguments because they can easily get around it.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.380]   But let's Apple make statements saying not on our platform.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.540]   I think that's all they ever really wanted out of this.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.740]   No, I agree with you.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:18.980]   I disagree with the headline privacy theater because I don't think Apple has been as
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.860]   aggressive in promoting this as they have been about other things that claims that they
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.620]   can make about how the company is running itself that could be kind of debunked.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.100]   They're doing what they can do, which is all we can really expect.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.500]   No, but I'm going to correct myself that technically speaking, they could probably
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.580]   assign a team, build a team that absolutely locks down the iPhone against pretty much
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.180]   every intrusion that you could imagine.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.700]   They could make Safari the most privacy centric.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.180]   They could create their own tour network, so to speak, to make sure that and create a
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.580]   library of JavaScript exceptions that, okay, this browser will run JavaScript, but it will
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.420]   not run these.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.700]   When it recognizes this code, it's not going to recognize it because we know it's being
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.620]   used for fingerprinting and stuff like that.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:10.900]   However, what we can ignore is that Apple does not have 100% control over their own platform
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:16.060]   because if they did that, if they made it impossible for services like Facebook, services
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.260]   like Google Docs to work the way that they do, guess what?
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.580]   All those services will say, well, I guess the showdown is happening.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.580]   We'll see if people would rather have an iPhone or they would rather have Facebook and Google
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.020]   Docs and Twitter and Google Search and all these other services.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.740]   So they have to walk a very, very fine line there.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.660]   And I'm glad that they're doing what they're doing.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.380]   They're saying, well, we're not going to make it easy for you.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.900]   We're not going to facilitate it.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.980]   We're going to create rules so that I think the most important thing they've done is essentially
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.100]   put in this rule into the app store saying, we have the right to pull your app.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:53.140]   If we think that you're doing something that is unfair to our users, it remains to be seen
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.560]   how they're going to enforce that.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.220]   But the rule is there so that if someone is really egregious about it, they can simply
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.220]   pull the app.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.740]   But the thing is they don't have the ability to shut everything down.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.140]   The other point is that remember that a lot of the technologies that make the web actually
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:13.500]   work, that turn the web into an app platform that make it so wonderful do require a lot
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   of access to hardware.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.980]   I mean, you need to know what the battery level is if you're going to have a rendering app
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.180]   that says, ooh, we better not do that because they run a store to cash everything.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.740]   You need this stuff.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.060]   These are like to your point, Leo, like these are frameworks that are necessary for developers
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.660]   to do a plethora of things that we really want them to do.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.580]   But unfortunately, they're just tools and tools get abused.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.900]   Well, and I think that also, again, Apple, I think one thing that's worked for them is
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.380]   letting the user choose.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.060]   And I think we'll probably see more of that.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.700]   Where do they say, do you not want to be tracked?
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.420]   And so you say, no, I don't want to be tracked or whatever like that because they're not doing
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   it themselves.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.500]   They're asking you, do you want to do that?
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.020]   I think that we could see somewhere in the future where Safari said, do you want to go
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.540]   into safe mode that isn't going to execute all these things?
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.780]   And the user just decides Apple won't put it on by default.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.940]   They'll let the user decide they want to turn it off and it will devastate the industry.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.260]   Like if they put that in there, it'll just rip because then it's people who want to keep
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.540]   on having their Google Docs and their Facebook and everything else will just leave it open.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.460]   You know, they'll just say, oh, I don't want to do that because I want these things.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.140]   But 80% will turn it off.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.740]   You know, and that's when that's when you get really good.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.740]   YouTube stops working.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.740]   Right.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.740]   Exactly.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.060]   I love, but I think one of the most effective things Apple's doing is promoting this name
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.500]   and shame thing, saying that we will give you a report that shows you exactly what sites
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.180]   are tracking you, what apps are tracking you, what they're collecting.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.700]   If then it's up to make an informed decision, if you're okay with all of this, by all means,
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.700]   go ahead, we're not going to stop it from working, but we will allow the information.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.780]   We will allow all these other publications to say, hey, how come this calculator app is
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.700]   asking me for my date of birth and my recent photo?
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700]   That's not right.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.180]   I should probably also just clarify that there are a lot of really good reports out there.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.580]   I don't want to paint with too broad a brush because I think that fake news has been like
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.060]   the just the term fake news is incredibly damaging.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.980]   But I also think because it's so weaponized and because people are attacking the media
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.100]   left and right, it is incumbent on people like us in the media to make sure that we
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.740]   dot our eyes, we triple check everything and we don't.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.180]   And I say this as a YouTuber who needs to keep me asserting that we don't think there's
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.460]   factual errors in either the information of the financial times piece.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.380]   They're factually accurate.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.260]   The assessment, the narrative may not be, but that happens all the time.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.820]   That's the subjective part, but the objective part is absolutely accurate.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.300]   And I think it's not unreal.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.500]   There are different interpretations.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.300]   You guys are Apple fans.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.980]   And so you're going to you're interpreting it in a way that's positive to Apple.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.540]   Not the rest of the world is not necessarily that way.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:50.180]   And it's not unreasonable to say, Hey, this is not Apple is is resting its laurels on
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.220]   how private they are.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:57.100]   And this one checkbox, you and I know that, but the rest of the world doesn't know doesn't
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.620]   make that much of a difference.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.060]   That's a completely legit narrative.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.100]   What Apple's future plans are unknown.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.820]   I don't think it's a specific thing.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.980]   I think it's legit though.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.500]   I think you could you can like we often see this with the headlines being taken one or
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.980]   one or more ways like a positive version negative version.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.700]   This just like I hate to like my mom will see a BBC report and she'll call me to say
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.180]   they've hacked my iPhone and it's completely not true.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.180]   Nobody's saying that.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.660]   And this is not this is look I'm going to completely disagree with you, Renee.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.460]   Apples do not track button as privacy theater is accurate.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.460]   It's accurate.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.340]   That's very little for privacy period.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.780]   No, no, that's a fact.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:41.300]   You can say well, Apple's going to tighten down the bolts or Apple never said it was going
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.780]   to be private or blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:50.060]   But the fact is Apple's ads are all over the place saying privacy, privacy, privacy.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.980]   And the thing that they did, which by the way, Facebook and snapper going, Oh my God.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.980]   Oh my God.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.460]   In fact, does not harm them.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.860]   So I think that's completely.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.420]   I think that's extremely it's privacy theater the same way taken off your shoes at the airport
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.420]   is security theater.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.860]   I think that's a legit headline completely.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.620]   It is well, what I would say.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:20.700]   What I would say about the privacy theater anyway, the the issue with with privacy theater
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.700]   is is that it's what it's effectively doing also though is moving public opinion because
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.540]   as you start to do that and as you start to have.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   I understand Apple may have commercial plans that are even if they don't do anything else.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.300]   It's completely legitimate at this point to ring the bell and say, you know that thing
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.260]   Apple did seven months ago, it didn't do anything.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.260]   Right.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.260]   But it's it is.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:47.500]   But when you're right, the but what I what I'm saying is is that when any when when the
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.660]   number comes out, that's 84, 85, 86% people are saying they don't want to be tracked.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.660]   There's a signal there.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.500]   Is it it opens up a whole bunch of doors for a whole bunch of new things that didn't occur.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.340]   And you and again, this gets into if Apple did everything it could do, they'd end up
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.420]   with lawsuits and people upset and that the same article the same writer for the same
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.140]   magazine be writing something completely different about how Apple's heavy handed and
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.260]   ruining all these things and making it not fun to be there anymore and all these other
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.140]   things.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.100]   Because they're doing it slowly, it's fine for them for people to complain they're not
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.100]   moving fast enough.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.140]   But I think that we're going to keep on seeing I I will be blown away if we don't see Apple
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.740]   just keep on just slowly turning out a little crank.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.740]   Slowly just that's a component.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:34.260]   By the way, that's a completely legitimate footnote for this show because that's what
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.540]   we talk about.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.660]   But I don't I don't think it's fair to castigate the financial times the information and tech
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.660]   dirt.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.660]   I'm recasting Leo.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.660]   I know you are.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.220]   But I think they're pointing out something that's it's just actively true.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.220]   I agree with you.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.260]   How many of those asked us though, like those pop ups came up so often we got to see how
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.220]   many of them were using this feature.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.860]   And if nothing else, it just opened the light on those cockroaches.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.140]   Well, but yeah, but I think that that's part of the problem is that now we go off.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.540]   See, I said, no, I'm not being tracked.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.020]   Well, guess what?
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.780]   That was not changed a thing.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.420]   My big my the only thing that really kind of got up my nose was the privacy theater is
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.140]   such an incendiary term, kind of like fake news where as soon as you say it, you're you're
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.260]   inviting in a huge environment of negativity around it.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.300]   I don't think that it quite merits that.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:27.500]   But I agree with your point that if that Apple should not say that, hey, look, we care we
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.660]   care more about privacy than any other well, actually that we're we didn't want to lie
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.660]   to you.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.020]   We're about to say that we care more.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.260]   No other company cares, but we care and we are protecting you.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.900]   They're not as aggressive about that as they used to be when these remember these say, oh,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.620]   we're the only we're the only one where you're not going to you don't worry about malware.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.620]   You don't have to worry about viruses.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.140]   You don't have to worry about any sort of malicious attacks.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.020]   As long as they're not pressing that button that hard, but you're right that if it's
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:33:00.620]   an easy buzzword that say that to to say that, hey, if you just simply flip the switch
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.820]   on the iPhone, no apps will not be able to track you.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.660]   We don't want that we don't want that to be the narrative that people understand.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.460]   It is a complicated multi layered thing and that there is no one switch that can be flipped
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.140]   that will protect you from being correct.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.300]   I think it's analogous to the do not track button in your browser, which many security
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:24.500]   experts, including Steve Gibson, you know, quickly pointed out it's it's an honor system.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.820]   So good luck with that.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.580]   And I think it's very similar to that.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.740]   And I think that I think that the issue that I have is foolish.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.900]   The issue that I have with any article that's that's that's sizeably one to one way.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.100]   Like this is the it's simple and this is what's actually happening is that it's always wrong.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.140]   Like everything's more complicated than it looks.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.940]   So it's other thing is anybody who thinks it's black and white like this is a very black
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.180]   and white article of like this is just the way it is and not that Apple could be doing
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.540]   these other things at least as a we're giving the footnote that should exist in the article
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.180]   of giving people both sides.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.940]   That's why people call and say that they're being tracked on, you know, because someone
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:07.020]   is you know, for someone to work in a somewhat balanced, you know, financial times we think
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.260]   is relatively balanced or whatever for someone to have credibility.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.620]   They have to be able to show you a little bit of both sides of what's actually happening
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.220]   here as opposed to and we've gotten into the press where it's all one sided like it's
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.180]   just going to be what it is, you know, and they're going to say the way it is.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.380]   And I think that's one of the powers for instance of this show is that we don't always
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.380]   agree.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.620]   And so you and so the listener gets to hear both sides of that and then they make a decision
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.780]   about what they want to believe.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.500]   But I think that when you write the article it's incumbent on you to kind of think about
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.900]   both sides, you know, of what that is and at least tell the reader there could be reasons
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.620]   for it rather than just like this is all a sham.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.060]   And you could write the same article like putting on my old hat.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.460]   You know, you can write the same article going, Apple Fire's first shots in war over privacy,
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.820]   companies desperate spinning up new technologies to track us.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.300]   All of this is just like narrative editorial choices.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.980]   And I think a lot of times we're skewing towards the more cynical ones.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.740]   And I'm hoping that's that's that's in the past and that we get to a more optimistic
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.220]   future at some point.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.620]   I think they're going to say, oh, you guys are just a bunch of Pollyanna's.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.420]   And the cynical view is exactly the view that continues to come out.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   Excuse me.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.420]   I prefer.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   I prefer to be called a point Dexter.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.420]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.820]   Well, I mean, honestly, let's really be.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.020]   I mean, let's think about it.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.940]   The track record of privacy across the board in the ad industry is not good.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.940]   Yes, it's zero.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.940]   It's less zero.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:32.420]   And frankly, the ability of companies, whether it's browser companies or Apple to fix that
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:37.580]   has been minimal, if not zero, partly because these guys are like ants.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.260]   I mean, they they're going to find some way to get in.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.820]   No matter what services.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.060]   Yeah, but I mean, you know, I think I think what Carl Bodie is arguing in tech dirt is
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:52.780]   there needs to be effective governmental privacy laws because no, nothing is going to happen
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:57.700]   if all you do is check boxes and say, don't track me 100%.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.700]   And that's.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.260]   Yeah, and that was the, by the way, that was the point of his article is, you know, companies
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.820]   can say do not track, but until somebody somebody really cracks the whip, it ain't got
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   to happen.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.980]   I don't care about the information.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.780]   They want that information.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.660]   If something is 20% something and 80% something else, I don't think you need to cover it 50
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.860]   50 and a fake sort of fair and balanced way.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.340]   I just think you got to stick to the facts and part of the facts and part of the opportunity
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.900]   of journalism is educating people.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.700]   It's not just saying, do you know this or not?
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.460]   No, this is like, if you don't know this, I'm going to tell it to you.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.460]   I'm going to explain this.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.300]   I'm going to leave you smarter than you were when you started it.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.460]   And I have this very Aaron Sorkinesk ideal of this kind of stuff.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.460]   So I get my.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:40.940]   And by and large GDPR is theater, privacy theater, like, you could write the exact same article
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:41.940]   about GDPR.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.220]   We have all these websites that are popping up that have us select all those things, but
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.300]   no one's really enforcing that yet.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:52.460]   Like, you know, and when if and when the EU starts to tighten that, it creates all kinds
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.020]   of problems for everyone, but people are ignoring that a lot.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.660]   So, and we have to have the heart conversation.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.460]   If I have to build a site, I've explained to people like, you can't do this.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.460]   You can't do this.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.460]   You can't do this.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.460]   We have to have approval.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.980]   Like, we're telling them what they have to do because of GDPR.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.980]   And they're like, but we're not.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.980]   We didn't do that last week.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   And it's not.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.220]   And your point is that GDPR is not really being enforced.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   It's not being enforced.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   In the same way.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.820]   It has the teeth.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.260]   It could be enforced.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.260]   It does.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.260]   But it's also damaging.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.260]   So, yeah.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.620]   So, so the point is is that it's, it's also theater until it starts to be.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.100]   So many forces in the area.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.420]   And Apple, and Apple has all these teeth that it has in that agreement of what they can
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   do.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:37.060]   And so GDPR and Apple's privacy are kind of on par.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:41.140]   You know, right now, now both of them have the ability to be tightened a lot.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.100]   And I think that we're going to see both GDPR as well as the California laws as well as
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.100]   so.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.220]   But even to your point though, even though there's government regulation, it's not doing
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.300]   any better right now or very little.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.380]   I think it's still rapping on GDPR isn't that old.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:03.100]   Italy just find Amazon 1.13 billion euros, which is, I don't think that was against GDPR.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.380]   I think that was Italy's own thing.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.380]   It was anti-composition.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.140]   But I'm saying we're starting to see company countries, Italy, Poland coming up with.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.780]   And that's how GDPR works, by the way.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   It's, you know, member nations have to enforce it.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.980]   I suspect we're going to start to see more and more of that.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.780]   Again, my only argument is that I think that GDPR slowly being tightened and so is Apple.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.860]   Like it's just, like we're just seeing privacy things that we're talking about.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.540]   They're both of them are happening about the same kind.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.580]   There's a significant difference, which is that GDPR has the weight of government and
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.540]   massive fines behind it.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.340]   Apple has commercial weight behind it.
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.340]   That's it.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.500]   Interesting thing too, is like in face of all this regulation, you see Apple's being
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.900]   chasin'ed in some ways.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.780]   They're changing app store regulations.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.820]   They're allowing, I don't want to say about it.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.820]   We're not ginnin' them in the red direction.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.820]   But they're doing self-repair.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:58.580]   Like YouTube is going through this whole crisis of conscience about how they handle this activity.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.420]   And yet Facebook is just hiring people that want to go out and make the world worse.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.020]   It's an amazing contradiction in how these things are involved.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.580]   Facebook is not as nudgeable, I guess.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:13.900]   Let's take a little break and while we do some technical adjustments, I'd like to tell
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.220]   you about userway.org.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:22.860]   Userway is something I can really resonate with because we do audio programming, my radio
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.100]   show, the podcasts I hear from a lot of blind listeners.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:33.420]   And one of the number one complaints from all disabled listeners is accessibility.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.140]   The thing is there is a great system for accessibility built into every browser.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.340]   It's called the accessibility layer.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.620]   And if a website gives them the right information, a website can be totally usable.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.540]   This is something you want, by the way.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:50.460]   You don't want to leave 60 million Americans with disabilities out in the cold.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.020]   You want to do the right thing.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.100]   And by the way, you don't want to be sued by over the Americans with Disabilities Act,
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.700]   which says you have to be accessible.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.460]   Userway is a pioneer in innovating accessibility technologies.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:12.380]   They've got an incredible AI powered solution that automatically enforces the hundreds of
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.380]   web content accessibility guidelines.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.460]   WooCag with just one line of JavaScript.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.780]   Userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers, making your website accessible.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.980]   And I know, look, I have websites.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.980]   That can be overwhelming.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.340]   It sounds like it's going to be hard.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.900]   You're going to have to hire engineers or it's going to be expensive.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.660]   Userway's solutions make it simple, easy, and cost effective.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.620]   In fact, the price is very affordable.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:45.660]   The cost for us of Userway is less than what we pay to web font foundries for our web fonts.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.660]   It's really affordable.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.780]   I'm going to make it even more affordable in a second.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.620]   Check out the Userway Scanning Tool.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.500]   It's at the website, userway.org/twit.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   You can run it.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.420]   You can see where you have problems or if it's fully compliant.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.420]   If it is, bravo.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.660]   Well done.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.980]   Userway is something that some of America's biggest companies turn to.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:12.140]   For a million websites, trust Userway, including Coca-Cola, eBay, Walmart, Disney, UNICEF, FedEx,
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   they all use Userway to make their site accessible because it's good business.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.660]   And now Userway's best-in-class enterprise level accessibility tools are available to
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.620]   us, small and medium-sized businesses.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.500]   And of course, if you should become a giant business, Userway is there for you.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.740]   It's ready.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:35.820]   Userway uses this line of AI to fix all sorts of things, automatically generating image
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.780]   alt text, for instance, using computer vision.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.740]   So all the descriptions in there, you can modify them.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.740]   You can improve them.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.780]   Absolutely, Userway makes that easy, but it gives you the start.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.580]   It will remediate one of the biggest complaints I hear, which is nav menus.
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.500]   Actually, everybody has problems with nav menus.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   Nav menus that are just unusable.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.860]   It's a big problem that Userway ensures all pop-ups are accessible, all forms.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.460]   It fixes vague link violations, any broken links.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.060]   Does things that you might not even think about?
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:11.740]   It makes your brand colors more accessible, not by changing the color itself, but just
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.740]   the brightness and the saturation.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.500]   Userway is completely platform agnostic, by the way.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   It works with everything.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.020]   It's easy with WordPress Shopify and Wix.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.020]   No problem.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.140]   AEM, site course, SharePoint, even a custom-built site.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.780]   If you can add a line of JavaScript, you can add Userway.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.420]   It integrates seamlessly and works perfectly.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:36.740]   It helps your business meet its compliance goals and improves the experience for all
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.240]   your users.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.380]   Just listen to Susan Bennett, the voice of Siri.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.380]   You're what she has to say.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.460]   Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.300]   You won't hear me say something like this too often.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.540]   I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're looking for.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:58.620]   But every day, that's what the Internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.

[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.500]   What else is new?
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.300]   This isn't strictly speaking Apple news, but it's going to affect everybody.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.500]   It does affect Apple a little bit.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.100]   Log for Shell.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.380]   Some people have described, I sure will be talking about this extensively on security now, but
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.140]   some people have described this as the worst security vulnerability in a decade.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:04.980]   It affects pretty much everybody running Apache, which is the number one server technology
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.140]   in the world, Apache Struts.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:14.380]   It is a bad exploit that gives hackers the ability to run malicious code on the servers.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.060]   It's affected a lot of servers.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.340]   I think it affected iCloud, I believe.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.380]   It's insanely easy to do too.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.380]   That's the thing.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.940]   I mean, in the login, if you put a specific thing into when they say ask for your email
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:33.620]   and password and you put this string into the email, where it's asked for your email,
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.540]   it goes into the login.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.740]   It's immediately executable.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.940]   That is a crazy, I mean, it's like there's no wall there at all.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.940]   It's too easy.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:49.620]   Java-based logging system, log4j, any browser could exploit it easily.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:55.300]   It included not just a Steam, Twitter, CloudFlare, Amazon, Tesla, Google, LinkedIn, and Minecraft,
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.220]   iCloud also subject.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.220]   So...
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.500]   Now, the fixes from what I understand is relatively simple, but...
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.820]   The patch is out so many.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.820]   It's...
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.340]   This is, by the way, highlights another very big weakness in the infrastructure of the
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.340]   Internet.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.580]   The companies are running on an open source project run by volunteers.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.700]   The guy who fixed it does this in a spare time.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.700]   The guy who found it fixed it.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.260]   I was like, "Oh, I do this one again."
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.700]   You know, these companies might want to kick in just a little to some of these projects
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.700]   that they're...
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.300]   Also, when infrastructure relies on...
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:31.140]   It's also when people say open source wins, it's an automatic thing.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.140]   It's not.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.540]   You've got to have people looking at all that code all the time.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:43.220]   And, you know, open source, like all code is vulnerable to mistakes and flaws and exploits.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.820]   And these things happen.
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:49.180]   The good news is it was fixed very, very quickly, but now you've got to patch all these servers.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.420]   And you know, that also affects a lot of people who are like my own home server.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   Like I was like...
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.140]   I turned off my Synology NAS when I heard about this like late Thursday night because
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.340]   I'm like, "Okay, I think I will just turn it off.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.020]   I believe that it's running Apache somewhere."
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.940]   And it took a couple of days for Synology to say, "Verify that, nope, this Synology NAS
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.940]   servers are not vulnerable to this."
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.380]   But that part of the problem was that as soon as this information started leaking out as
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.140]   a Minecraft bug, immediately everybody with half an interest in trying to exploit this
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.540]   started saying, "Yeah, I wonder what I could do with this."
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:28.260]   And that's why it really became ruined everybody's Friday, everybody's weekend because it had
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.340]   to be locked down real quick because as soon as you find out...
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:35.580]   As soon as the lights go out all over Manhattan, that's when people start figuring out, "Hey,
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.060]   I could get that new TV."
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:42.820]   Well, and the issue is that it's not just that it opens up your server and the big servers
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.700]   can all get handled, but now there's a trust issue between all the servers because all
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.780]   these people who haven't handled it, the millions of servers that haven't even been
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:54.220]   touched yet to be fixed because people don't even know that they're running it probably,
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.180]   they're now going to have malicious code that could be talking to other servers.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.420]   So it just opens up this incredible can of worms.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:04.820]   It's pretty amazingly horrible.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.820]   And I...
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.780]   Just quickly, one of the biggest security problems in the world is just the simple fact
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.100]   that if something is working, people tend to leave it alone.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.140]   And so oftentimes it's an operating system, it's a server, it's something like that.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:21.300]   They don't know how it works, the person who set it up no longer works for the company.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.340]   All they know is that they're getting their documents sent from one division to another
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.300]   very, very easily, they don't know that they're running an old, unpached version of Apache
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.300]   that still has this vulnerability, and that's where trouble starts.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.500]   Patch, patch, patch.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.820]   But mostly that's fixed.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:48.980]   I guess the residents will be felt for years to come throughout all sorts of communities.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:54.620]   Steve Gibson will, I'm sure, in great detail cover, the log for Shell Vulnerability later
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.820]   this afternoon on security now.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:04.340]   Apple, we were talking about how Apple, the judge said, "You got to implement these new
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.260]   app store rules.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.940]   Apple has appealed and won a delay."
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:15.260]   So once again, you don't have to worry about it.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:20.300]   We knew that when I came up, when they were going back to the judge, that is the...
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.900]   As we talked about on a couple episodes ago, that's what you have to do first.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.100]   As you go back to the judge, I'm asking to reconsider, but that was one step for Apple
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.660]   to move it to an appeals court.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.660]   And so...
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:36.020]   The nice circuit court on appeals has granted the iPhone makers requested delay implementation.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:39.780]   Perhaps for years, because this is going to go on for a while.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:46.380]   The one part of the Apple Epic lawsuit that Apple lost, Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers said,
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.020]   "You've got to implement it by December.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.020]   Apple appealed and they won on appeal."
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.660]   Let me see if I can find the...
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.020]   By the way, I think part of the problem was, is she was so unreasonable about it.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:00.340]   If she had said a year out, it might have actually stuck.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:05.420]   But saying it was three months out was not going to ever work for an appeals court.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.420]   What's so...
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.420]   Because they didn't...
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.980]   The appeal was to not have to implement it while they were appealing it, which I think
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.980]   was the other part.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.340]   If she had stated it so that they wouldn't have to implement it while they were appealing
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   it, this wouldn't have happened any way.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   But that's the issue.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   But they also keep building this language.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   But they also keep building this language.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.140]   So, her point, in fact, she addressed that specifically in her judgment, is, "Look, if
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.380]   I allow a state on a pending appeal, this will never happen."
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.380]   So...
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.380]   But I think that they're...
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.380]   I think that's a good part of the problem.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.380]   It was a little bit cheaper.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.420]   They keep getting that language put in, which says that they can still charge commission
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.420]   even on external...
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.820]   And that's the most important part to them is to just keep having that stated overall
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.820]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.420]   Well, and the thing is, even...
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:51.220]   And I think that the issue is, again, it was so short a runway to move anything large that,
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:56.940]   again, if she had said it had to be done by the end of 2022, that would have been a
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.940]   different conversation for the appeals court.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.220]   But having something that's this close, I think.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.980]   And I think it's reasonable for you to figure out whether you can't do it before you start
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:09.020]   making people change their infrastructure and their entire business model.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.220]   It's reasonable to say, "Well, why don't we find out if everybody agrees first?"
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:17.540]   I think the big problem for Epic is that they've now basically lost almost everything that
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.780]   they went for.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.580]   They've burned up a relationship with one of their largest partners.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.940]   That partner will most likely be promoting unity all of next year.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:31.820]   It's billions of dollars that can be racked up to hubris.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.820]   So it's...
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:38.940]   The district kind of set a signal that Epic's suit has very little merit.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.940]   This is the...
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:46.140]   In granting Apple's appeal, this is the order, said Apple has demonstrated at minimum that
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.700]   its appeal raises serious questions in the merits of the district court's determination
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.460]   that Epic Games failed to show Apple's conduct violated any antitrust laws, but did show
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.540]   that the same conduct violated California's unfair competition law.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.340]   So effectively, the court is saying, "You know what?
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:05.940]   There's not a whole lot of merit in Epic's case in any respect."
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.060]   So that's that.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.060]   That's over.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:12.780]   I'm a little gruntled, but that's okay.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.380]   I would have liked that side.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.380]   Looks good.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.580]   It looks like it's set by it on the web, but okay, fine.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.580]   Same.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.620]   I'm very surprised.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:25.780]   When this suit was launched, they had a murderer's row of litigators on their backs.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.460]   Basically, people have experienced an antitrust.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.420]   The hammer experience in this kind of case, I thought that Apple's going to be in a lot
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.420]   more trouble than they actually turned out to be.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.420]   But it's a terrible team.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   There's no case.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.220]   Which I will say that I said from the day one, "Look, there's no case here."
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.540]   So there was no...
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.900]   They just have to prove things that are not provable.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.660]   And that's the...
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.660]   They can't...
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:51.660]   They have to separate...
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.860]   Be able to separate the iPhone from all other phones that look exactly like it and say that
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.300]   it's somehow a different thing.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.300]   And that just is really...
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.220]   That's a uphill battle for someone to make a decide.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.740]   That just almost undoable.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.740]   Which I think your point is almost undoable.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.740]   Your point has been proven.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.140]   I think that this is it.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.460]   But I wonder how far Epic is going to pursue this at this point.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.780]   I suspect they just drop it.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.900]   No, he doesn't seem like he's that kind of guy.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:19.900]   Really?
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.060]   Well, Tim, Epic does not seem like he's easily swayed.
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.060]   I'm sorry, Andy.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.220]   I don't think we're going to say the same thing.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.540]   The court's basically saying you got nothing here, guy.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.540]   Founders aren't rational.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.060]   CEOs are rational.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.620]   Founders are not rational people.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:36.380]   What I was going to say is that the judge, when you read the ruling, seemed almost
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.900]   annoyed saying that, look, here's how you could have won this case.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:40.900]   But you didn't say that.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.500]   Or you could have said this, but you didn't make that case.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.060]   Or you could have accused them of that, but you didn't do that.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.340]   So it's almost as if they're saying, everybody wants to sue Apple.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.340]   Here's the pressure.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.340]   Here's how to do.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.900]   Here's how not to waste my time with a lawsuit against Apple.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   Please don't waste my time.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.380]   I think there's no issue with all of those things, have other problems with them.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.820]   Like all the things that he pointed out, he said, those are things that are there.
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.300]   I think that the fundamental issue is the reason that because playing for this is not
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:12.060]   because of Fortnite or anything else, they are playing for the metaverse.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.940]   They think that the metaverse is a big deal.
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:18.260]   They think that they are already selling lots of assets into that process.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:23.260]   And so the very nature of the metaverse is what they're fighting about.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.100]   They don't want to sell games.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.220]   They want to sell assets.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.860]   They want to sell tons and tons and tons of assets into an ecosystem.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:35.900]   And that entire business model doesn't work inside of the Apple ecosystem because you
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   can't have lots of people exchanging assets back and forth for real cash value and have
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.780]   that actually turn out.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:48.220]   And so I think it's less about their current model and about their future business model.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.820]   And I think from the future perspective, I think, again, the problem they're really
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:57.340]   going to have is that they really, if you pick a fight with a really big person, you
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.620]   need to make sure you're going to win.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.700]   And when you don't win, this gets real ugly real quick.
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.980]   And I think that they were already being brought in for the keynotes.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.260]   And Apple was showing them off and pushing them forward.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.100]   And that's worth billions.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.260]   Like them being put up on that keynote stage is worth billions.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:20.340]   And now they're going to most likely see, again, we saw Weta being brought up on the
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.340]   keynotes.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:26.260]   So there's no reason why Weta Digital won't be back up on the keynotes as a unit of unity.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.660]   Can you compete, Alex?
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:33.620]   Because it sounds like every rendering talent on the planet and the real five was amazing.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:39.060]   I will say that without Weta Digital, I would have said, no, and this is the crazy thing
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.020]   is almost all of us had written unity off.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.580]   Like, we were just like, well, unity isn't really competitive anymore.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.540]   There's not really going to be anything there we should just all focus on.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:52.620]   And we really thought until this lawsuit popped up, we really thought it was all about Unreal.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.500]   And Unreal 5.0, Unreal 5 looks amazing.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   Nanite is amazing.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.660]   A lot of the new tools are really amazing.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.980]   But I don't know if that matters.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:06.180]   That matters for games, those really, really high-poly solutions.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:11.020]   But it doesn't necessarily matter on a day-to-day AR business model.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.020]   And the way that graphics will be used in the next couple-- it makes a big difference
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.300]   in what will happen in the next three, four, five years, next one, two, three years, maybe
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.500]   not as much.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:25.500]   And what the problem is, is that what it did was it took a nearly clean kill of unity
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   and now Apple's going to build them up.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.180]   They're going to build them up as another solution.
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.260]   And it's because they've already partnered with it.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.620]   And so, what is going to come out as a unit of unity.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:40.100]   And all of those things are going to pick up speed again.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.100]   And it was just something that they didn't need to do.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:46.620]   And now, if they think they're going to get any help, if Unreal things are going to get
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:52.620]   any help at all, going into what Apple thinks is its big business, they've given up all
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:53.620]   of that.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.020]   There's no special meetings.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.820]   There's no inside connections.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.540]   There's no-- like all of that's gone.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.540]   And so they--
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.540]   I forget what my email says, Tim.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.220]   Super, super expensive mistake.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.220]   But still--
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.220]   But still--
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.620]   But still, it does point out the importance of this kind of fight and why I don't think
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.580]   this is going to be the last Apple hears of it.
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:17.260]   Apple is going to spend a lot of time over the next four, five, six, over the future
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:22.020]   of the App Store defending the concept of if you sell-- if anybody who uses any of the
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:26.300]   product that is sold through an app on the App Store, we get 30%.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   We deserve 30%.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.220]   We're entitled to 30%.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:36.020]   When the monetization of an app becomes that here's a marketplace where we can make a lot
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:41.180]   more money off of the stuff people buy through the app than the app itself, that really raises
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:46.220]   a lot of legitimate questions about, well, look, how did you help us?
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.260]   You didn't-- you didn't-- all you did was you did-- you made the phone.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.260]   That's fine.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.700]   That's what kind of helping you sell the phones by making good products.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:59.100]   Why are you-- how are you giving us 30% value by forcing us to-- every time someone buys
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.740]   a pony, you get 30% of the pony.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.540]   I'm not taking a position one way or another on it.
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:09.060]   But as the value of that level of transaction becomes more and more and more important,
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.860]   and it's already hugely important in gaming, I think that Apple is going to be forced to
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:18.060]   defend this over and over again, probably with better and better arguments against them.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.540]   Here's what you'll be missing on Apple's platform.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:30.780]   This is the Unreal Engine's newest demo with the Matrix, 33,000 simultaneous vehicles in
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.780]   this demo.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.780]   Let me see if I can skip ahead to some of the vehicular--
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.780]   When they get to the old cano, I can't always tell them apart.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.780]   Like I can't.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.380]   Like the older cano and he was in and out.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   I can't always tell.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.380]   You can't tell.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.380]   Which one is real?
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:45.260]   The new cano is even cooler and more mellow.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.260]   That's how you can tell.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.220]   The helicopter scenes are unbelievable.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.460]   This is not the movie, by the way.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.460]   This is the game.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.460]   I just want to point this out.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.460]   Not even the game.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:53.460]   It's just a demo.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.460]   Well, it's a demo.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.180]   But I think this is Unreal Engine, right?
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:59.460]   So I imagine it will work somewhat like this.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.260]   Not on an E iOS device.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:05.020]   Again, if you look at-- but if you want to say, "Oh, well, Unity can't do that," we'll
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:10.540]   look at Oatmeal Studios doing stuff on Amazon or whatever, that's all done in Unity.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.980]   Unity's capable of a vast majority of these things as well.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:21.580]   Again, what really was where the shoe dropped was when they bought Weta Digital, because
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:29.100]   that's going to give them immense technological resources to its 250 engineers that are now
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.100]   that are already doing film quality work.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.820]   It really puts them in an entirely different position.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.180]   So I think that there's a lot to be said there.
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.860]   To Andy's point, I think that-- which I've said a couple of times-- is I think Apple's
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.140]   number only predator is antitrust at this point.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:48.140]   They don't have any natural peers or predators at this point.
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.260]   They're moving faster than everyone else.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:55.260]   It's as if you had a 800-pound gorilla that could run as fast as a cheetah.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:58.660]   That's the problem that everybody has, is that they're moving really fast and they're
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.420]   really big.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.500]   And that is going to eventually become a problem.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:08.500]   I think where antitrust has more teeth is that if Apple-- I think Apple has the potential
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:12.980]   to just lay waste to the AR landscape and the real problem that they're going to have
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:18.260]   as they roll that out is becoming a monopoly in that space.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:25.180]   And not having another group that has 50% or like right now, Google still-- some Google
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:28.660]   version of Google still has 75% maybe.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:33.740]   But Facebook's trying and they're very excited about it and they changed their whole name.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:41.260]   But so far, their rollout has been sputtering compared to what Apple appears to be doing.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.660]   So, I think that there's this huge weight of sometime over next year or the year after
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:48.140]   we're going to see this massive rollout.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:52.980]   And I think that that's going to be something that Apple could end up owning, but the problem
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.500]   with owning it, the best thing that ever happened to Apple, even though they're bitter about
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.260]   it, was Android.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.900]   It is literally the best thing that happened to Apple.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.180]   It's funny because Apple was the best thing that happened to Microsoft when they were
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.180]   under antitrust scrutiny.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   Exactly.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:11.180]   And Android is way better for Apple than Apple was for Microsoft because Apple was
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.580]   never broke 10%.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.940]   Android has 75% of the world market right now.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:21.580]   So that's what makes all these antitrust really complicated with the phone.
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:26.620]   But the issue is if Apple moves into a new market and suddenly owns it, it becomes this
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.300]   ball of wax where they have to worry about it.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.740]   And I'm sure that they're thinking through those things.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.540]   And I think that to Andy's point, I don't think that it's Apple's right in its current
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.340]   state to charge 30% because it's business.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.020]   I don't think 30% is sustainable.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.100]   I don't think that it's going to stay that way.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:47.100]   I would be five years from now, if we're paying more than 15 and probably more than 10, I'd
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.100]   be surprised.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.220]   It's going to be the pushback from users.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.420]   Once the things start breaking where I'm sick and I, the people are kind of okay with
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.220]   leaving the Kindle app to buy Kindle book, they're kind of okay with leaving comics
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.300]  ology to buy comics once a week.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:06.540]   Once it becomes, no, I can't do damn near anything in this app until I log into like
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.940]   tab into a Safari browser and make the purchase there, that's when Apple's going to start
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.020]   to feel pressure, I think.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.020]   I think the issue is that I don't pass.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.260]   Yeah, I'm seriously upset.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.700]   I can't like sorry, Alex.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700]   Go ahead.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.700]   Go ahead.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.100]   Oh, I was going to say like there's like my argument was always if the Google Play store
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.460]   was that much better, people would be making apps that just couldn't be possible on the
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.900]   app store and that'd be the biggest way to change Apple's business.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.860]   Like if Uber could only work on the on the Google Play store, Instagram could only work
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.260]   on the Google Play store, Apple would change their business model in a heartbeat and I
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.540]   could never find anything.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.460]   It was always like, yeah, anti-virus apps.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.740]   That's the only type of app that Apple doesn't have on the app store.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.540]   But now it's like game streaming services.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.620]   It's like that in two years, that's going to be like not having Netflix and Disney Plus
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.940]   on your platform and I still can't wrap my head around.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.620]   I just, you know, how Apple can be that short-sighted.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.340]   I know that games are really, you know, that games are a big deal and Apple makes a lot
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.340]   of money with games.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.900]   I just don't think that Apple users are as geeky as we make them out to be in that they
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.260]   want the ecosystem.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.220]   A lot of what Apple does is it's seamless and it doesn't take a lot of time and they
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.220]   don't have to think about it very much.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.260]   And I think for most Apple users, that's more important than the individual features.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.020]   When Fortnite disappeared, there wasn't an uprising.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.020]   People weren't that up there.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020]   They're like, oh, I'll play something else.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:24.180]   You know, like because their Apple ecosystem was far more important than any given game.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.180]   And I think that it's going to be difficult to tear them away because, you know, I think
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.300]   that for real Apple users that are really just using Apple, they're not kind of partially
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.780]   Android and partially Apple and everything else.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.620]   But like for people who are like me, I will admit, I have Android stuff, I have Windows
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.340]   stuff, but 99% of my world is in an Apple ecosystem.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.380]   I view anything that changes that ecosystem as an existential threat.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:49.140]   And if there's not a, if there's not, if the app doesn't work on the Mac, I go, oh, I
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.300]   probably won't use that.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.540]   You know, and so, and I think that, I don't, I think that I'm pretty representative of
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.420]   people who are solely on the Apple platform is that we want it to be easy and part of
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.180]   our, we don't want it to be a distraction.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:05.700]   And there's not that many things that we really care about that outside of that our platform
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.620]   works, you know, and so, so I think that that's the hard part is I don't think you're going
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.220]   to get, I think you may get regulators getting talked to by the companies that want into
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.220]   that platform.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.900]   But you have an enormous number of people that I think the vast majority of Apple users,
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.540]   I would not say all, but probably 80, 90% just don't care.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.540]   That's probably true.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.540]   You know, I'm going to put that content for Apple.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:29.860]   It's like saying, you know, people who live in Canada don't miss a stake, a stake in shake,
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.860]   a stake in bake because they have a stake.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.020]   We do miss it Leo, because you have no experience.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.980]   The same way that we have, you know, we don't really care about Tim Horvich.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.820]   We've tried it at no point in here missing.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.460]   However, I think you're right at this point, Apple's only threat.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:50.340]   I mean, they've fended off this threat pretty darn well is from within.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:55.180]   I don't think anybody's going to come from outside Apple and just disrupt your perfect
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.460]   problem is that again, they're in our system.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.700]   They're in a hockey stick moment.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.340]   They're in a hockey stick moment at a three billion dollars.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.820]   I mean, three trillion dollars.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:04.820]   That's crazy.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:09.220]   Like, just to think about that, just for a minute, like the fact that they are there,
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.420]   but it's not just that they're successful.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.340]   They're about to become a lot more successful.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.340]   And that's the crazy.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.340]   That's no measure.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:17.060]   However, quality, it's merely a measure of success.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.140]   You know, they're, Donald's is pretty successful too, but it's not the best stake I ever had.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.540]   Well, there's McDonald's doesn't have stake at McDonald's.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.540]   You guys have stake at McDonald's?
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.340]   Well, it's chopped up into a patty.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.260]   But it's beef in there.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.260]   We've lowered our expectations.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.300]   It's a chopped cheese.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.300]   I gotcha.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.340]   You know, I'm glad you're happy.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.740]   So happy in the Apple ecosystem.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.740]   I'm good for you.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:44.780]   I just think it doesn't mean it is above all criticism or it is perfect.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.100]   No, no, I don't think it's above all.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.300]   Disney Plus would be a problem.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.820]   And I think going forward, if they don't have content, like they've never been super
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.820]   successful at games.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:56.540]   And as we go from the Apple TV to VR, that's going to be much more key component because
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.460]   it's going to be about immersive experiences.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.460]   And a super easy way to solve for that is just to have game pass and PlayStation Store
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.460]   and Nintendo Store.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.460]   Well, now we know, by the way.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:09.220]   Does all the heavy lifting from the Apple Epic, the trial that keeps on giving that
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:14.180]   both Microsoft and Sony at one point were very interested in getting into the App Store,
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.340]   both decided not to.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:21.300]   Microsoft said, given Apple's rules, there's no place for us there and created X Cloud
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.300]   and Safari.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.660]   Sony just said, forget it entirely.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.700]   Can you imagine Netflix having to put every one of their videos in the iTunes Store?
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.700]   It's ridiculous.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.700]   They were good rules.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.860]   But also to Alex's point, you know, Apple's sheeple don't care.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.420]   I don't think they're saying, gosh, I really want to.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.420]   I care.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.540]   Well, I think the thing is, is that I think that just the Apple users oftentimes, I think
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.060]   that the nature of it is they've got a lot of things going on in their life and their
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.220]   technology isn't the center of it.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.860]   Like they just, you know, like they're not, they're not, but they're not like centered
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   around the technology.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:57.180]   I'll give you an example because I completely agree with you.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.740]   You know, because I do that radio show I do.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.780]   I hear from normal people all the time.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.140]   Here's a great, here's a perfect example of people who do want it to be simple.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.940]   And Apple took away series ability to send email to send traffic directions.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:19.060]   A whole bunch of stuff has made no comment about why or whether they're ever going to
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.060]   bring it back.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.260]   And as discombobulated, you know, many, many of its users.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.180]   Now those people are accessibility community.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.660]   Yeah, especially accessibility, but not just there's elderly people and there's others.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:33.260]   There's a lot of reasons people might want you Siri to do these things.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.020]   They just took that capability away.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:41.420]   And that's the downside to a walled garden is you all you're also completely at Apple's
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.420]   mercy.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.100]   Well, we're always like being an apples mercy.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.100]   I understand.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.900]   But we're so we're so we're.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.220]   No, but but but what I would argue, I guess, is that we're at everybody's mercy.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.060]   Like everybody we go to, you know, like I I threw a tantrum the other day because I
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:00.260]   realized that that I can't get Nutella at Whole Foods because it competes with their
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.900]   own 360 brand.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.260]   You can't buy Nutella Whole Foods.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.780]   They took Nutella out and I suddenly realized it was gone and I realized other than for
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.780]   you more than anything else.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.500]   I don't I don't have that much of it.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.460]   It's not exactly a health food, Alex.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.140]   No, it isn't health food.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.820]   The point is is that when I realized why they did it.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.340]   It wasn't Leo.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.220]   It wasn't it wasn't about your health.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.220]   Okay.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   It wasn't about the Nutella.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.220]   It's the principle of the thing.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:27.580]   The principle of the thing is that is that is that whole food just since Amazon took over
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.340]   Whole Foods is once once I saw that I started paying attention to Whole Foods.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:36.420]   I I spend a lot of time on Whole Foods and and the whole food just very much by the way,
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.420]   like Apple.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.420]   So I'm not surprised.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.420]   Totally.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:43.500]   Well, I mean, Amazon, here's what happened was that here's what here's what happened
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:49.100]   was I had a we were doing this video with someone who makes food and they we were talking
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:54.140]   about the fact that they made they were asked by Costco to come in to sell their food,
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.660]   you know, to sell food into Costco, but Costco wanted them to change all their ingredients
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.180]   and add more whole bunch of things that would that, you know, basically are a whole bunch
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.940]   of preservatives right into their stuff and they just chose not to work with Costco.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.700]   That conversation basically meant I'll never go to Costco like you know, because because
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.500]   what it meant was that the brand that you see in Costco is not the same food that you buy
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   anywhere else.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.660]   And as soon as I realized that I couldn't eat it.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.260]   They do sell six pound buckets of Nutella, however.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.260]   I don't care.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   I mean, if you really need Nutella, it's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.260]   It's not about the Nutella.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.260]   You agree?
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.820]   You're making, they have made decisions that I've decided...
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.820]   That's why we fight for freedom as hard as we can.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:46.820]   Sure.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:47.820]   Sure.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.600]   And we can fight for that and we get on the show.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.600]   We complain about people.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   We complain about it.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.660]   But the point is that everything is that way.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.980]   Everything around us is someone made a bunch of decisions.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.340]   I don't agree with all of them, but I've decided this is the best it can be.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.540]   But still in the difficult way.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:06.380]   But Steve Jobs said that the secret to life is realizing that those decisions were made
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.020]   by people who are stupider than you and you can change that.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.540]   And Alex Fus is going to do that.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:19.580]   And people who care about it as much, if they really care about it, they throw a tantrum.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.060]   And I think that, for instance, I will be surprised if the accessibility issues don't
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.580]   come back in because accessibility is super important to Apple.
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.220]   And so for no good business reason other than they care about it.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:35.060]   Like it's not a big enough model for them, but they really care about accessibility.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:39.940]   And so I think that if there's a solid accessibility argument that this was taken away, I think
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.180]   that I feel like something just went wrong there.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.580]   Like I don't know if there's some decision.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.100]   The problem is the pointable, but there's no excuse for not communicating about it.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.100]   Because I agree with you.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.060]   Because the community is so, like I don't want to say Friday, but like they always think
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.380]   that they're on the edge of being canceled.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.740]   That if there's ever any pressure, they'll be the first people thrown off the boat.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.260]   And so they go to every update, petrified that something that they depend on for literally
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.700]   life and limb is going to be taken away from them.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.020]   And when it happens, you can't be silent about it.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.520]   You've got to say, we're re-architected.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.740]   I know they don't want to, but I've got to say we're re-architecting this part of Siri.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.740]   It destroyed all this stuff unintentionally.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.940]   We're working really hard to even if you do it like with accessibility community reporters,
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.940]   it's just knowledge, help.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.020]   It's inexplicable to me.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:31.340]   But you know, Apple, not only is Apple in the hockey stick, but it's impressive as hell
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.460]   with what it's doing.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.900]   You did a piece deep, now I want to know what you said.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.020]   I haven't watched the video yet, Renee.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.900]   M1 Pro versus Max.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.580]   You did a piece on that on your.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.740]   Tell me what your thinking is.
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:49.260]   Because I, well, I shouldn't tell you what I decided, but I, well, I will.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:53.780]   I got the M1 Pro because I don't think I need the GPUs and the Max.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.780]   And I feel like I'm really happy with how fast it is.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:01.860]   The bottom line for it is if you want battery life, get the M1 Pro and the 16 inch MacBook
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.300]   Pro because it has the biggest battery and the lowest draw and it's going to last you
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.100]   as long as is inhumanly possible.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.900]   If you really care about speed, you want to get the M1 Max and the 16 inch because it
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   has double the rendering engines, double the GPUs, you can get much more RAM.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.540]   And because of the thermal envelope is bigger, not only will it sustain longer, but you can
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:23.420]   put it in high power mode, which is kicks on those fans, kicks on those CPUs and you
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.100]   can get stuff done really, really fast.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   Now, if you do need something more portable, you can go for the 14 inch versions of either
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.100]   of those.
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:34.260]   You just know you're going to get a slightly smaller physical battery and a slightly smaller
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.740]   thermal envelope.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:39.180]   But if you're carrying it around all day, that might be a very small price to pay to
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.380]   get all of that power in a very small computer.
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.420]   So I think I made the right choice.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.500]   Actually, I got the 14, not the 16, but you'll know if you need the Max, Leo, like you'll,
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.900]   like I got it because I render every day and one places fast and rendering.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:56.660]   I told him, Alex says first TikToks, yeah, get them, get them, get them, Max.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.180]   Because it's time is money.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:04.220]   And if you're up at 140 in the morning, rendering your TikTok video, you need a Max, basically.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.940]   So you get a little step in between.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.020]   It's just so much faster.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:12.900]   And then you can do stuff like, again, it's so fast, I can make my thumbnail while I'm rendering
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.420]   the video and I couldn't do that on Intel.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:15.780]   It would just be slow sluggish.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.420]   It would be like, like, if you're worth frame rate, then I am right now.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.900]   Oh, that's, that's actually interesting.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:24.820]   You can multitask because the machine is so powerful, you can let it do its rendering
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.700]   and continue to do your thumbnails.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.140]   Yeah, because the rendering is really cool.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.660]   ProRes used to be CPU bound.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:33.300]   And so it would really hit hard and it didn't do anything else.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.660]   And now it's not touching the CPU or GPU at all.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.500]   So I have like a second computer that I can keep using while it's rendering.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   It's amazing.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:43.500]   Let's take a little, a second little break.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.020]   Come back with some tidbits, a little bit this, and then I don't know if we've missed anything
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   big.
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:53.660]   We didn't go into what's new in Monterey 12.1 and iOS 15.2.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.020]   We'll talk a little bit about that too.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:01.700]   When we come back, Renee Richie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, Andy Inaco from Inaco.com and WGBH
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:07.180]   Boston, Alex Lindsey from office hours.global.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:10.060]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:15.620]   I have this conversation with my kids all the time, but also with anybody, young people,
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:21.260]   especially because you can benefit from this most of all.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:26.620]   You know, my kids say, "Oh, should I buy this AMC stock?
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.660]   Should I get into Dogecoin?"
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:34.020]   And I say, "Look, it's fine to play and understand that you're playing.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:40.780]   But if you want to build long-term wealth, if you want to save for college, for your
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.700]   kids, or your house, your first house, or for retirement, you should look at a Wealthfront
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.700]   investment account.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.900]   Keep a little bit aside for your stonks and your diamond hands.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.500]   That's fine.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.780]   But Wealthfront is the way to really build wealth long-term.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.260]   They make it easy to get the right tools for every portfolio.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:03.220]   They just ask a couple of simple questions to get an idea of what you're saving for your
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:07.140]   time, frame your risk tolerant you are.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:14.260]   And then they will create, just for you, globally diversified, low-cost portfolio based on low-cost
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.060]   index funds in minutes.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:18.700]   You can build your own portfolio too.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.060]   They have clean energy funds.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.540]   You want to get into crypto.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.220]   They've got crypto trusts.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.300]   They've got tech, hundreds of other investments.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.540]   I really like the socially responsible portfolio they offer.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:34.460]   It's a mix of funds built around human rights, climate change, sustainability, and diversity.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:40.020]   Think about what your money, where your heart is, and still build long-term wealth.
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.180]   And you don't have to sit and watch the indexes every day.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.020]   There's no manual trading, no stock picking.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.220]   They automatically handle all the investing.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:55.900]   And they do things that even fancy advisors don't do, things like rebalancing your portfolio
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.900]   automatically.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:03.500]   So you're not too heavy into one area or tax loss harvesting to lower your tax bill.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.740]   It really works.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:09.780]   It's just a great way to manage your goals for your future.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.740]   Wealthfront's trusted with over $27 billion in assets.

[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.660]   Wealthfront.com/makbreak.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.460]   Thank you, Wealthfront, for supporting Macbreak Weekly.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:01.740]   Thank you, dear listener and viewer, for supporting us by using that address.

[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.860]   Apple is launching support for keys and Apple Wallet.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.180]   Six Hyatt Hotels, the first to support it.
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:17.260]   I like the idea of just using my watch to unlock the door.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:23.180]   It'll be at the Hyatt Hawaii, the Andaz Maui in Wailea.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.540]   Hyatt Centric Key West.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.420]   Hyatt House Chicago.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.940]   Hyatt House Dallas.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.860]   Hyatt House Fremont.
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.660]   Silicon Valley and Hyatt House Long Beach.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:37.860]   So now, Alex, you never have to leave your Apple Bathtub.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.900]   You don't even have to carry a car key.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   Just see.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.900]   No, Siri bubbles.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:42.900]   No, Siri bubbles.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.900]   Apple Hotels.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.900]   No, it's a great example of that, actually.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.700]   They announced this a while ago.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.660]   It was just years ago.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.660]   It's taken a while.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.660]   It took a long time.
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:55.620]   Yeah, and so you always--
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:58.380]   Well, I'm going to say the original implementation was really different than this because they
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:02.260]   didn't have the same technologies with the original Apple Watch.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:05.860]   So Aloft implemented it, but you had to be within Bluetooth proximity.
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.420]   And then to prevent other doors from opening, you had to put the watch close enough to disrupt
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.220]   the magnetic field around the lock.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.700]   And only when those two things were true would it actually unlock.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.540]   But that was an implementation almost no hotel was interested in playing out.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:21.020]   I wish I would love to have my driver's license and my wallet as well.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.260]   I mean, I have my COVID card in there, which is great.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:33.620]   Washington DC just voted to use Apple's wallet for their digital driver's licenses and IDs.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.620]   I think that's great.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.460]   Did they vote on Apple's?
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.820]   I just saw that they were doing digital ones.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:49.060]   Mostly, they amended their ID laws to say that a digital version of an idea is acceptable
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.420]   with the definition of what that digital idea is going to be that remaining to be defined.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.420]   I'm going to guess though.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.420]   But that's a big deal.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.220]   It ain't going to be on Android.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.980]   Maybe it will, I don't know.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:01.900]   It will be on Android or Samsung.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.420]   Yeah, maybe Samsung.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:07.860]   Yeah, I mean, I guess-- and I guess these 20 states that are now doing this along with
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:12.660]   DC, I guess they could have their own state app, the Maryland driver's license app and
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:15.540]   so forth that would work.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:23.260]   I think DHS has-- I believe it's DHS, but a federal agency has issued guidelines as to
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:29.700]   what they believe a digital ID should support and should ensue before a state should approve
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.700]   it.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.700]   However, this is all due to the state.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:35.340]   So this is going to be state by state by state district, excuse me, state by state before
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.180]   this comes true.
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.380]   We need a really good solid standard that everybody can fall behind because nobody wants
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:46.780]   to-- nobody wants to have to update a million different logs, a million different POS determinals
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:50.100]   before they know what is actually going to be required hardware-wise to make this sort
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.420]   of stuff work.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:56.300]   I have to say, I am pleased that Apple is making a brand new Android app.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300]   Yay!
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:01.460]   Messages, messages, messages will make no.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.540]   AirTags and FindMyDetectorApp for Android.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.140]   And really, this is not because they want you to use airTags necessarily.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:11.580]   I don't think it will even do that.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.780]   But what it will do is identify nearby airTags.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.820]   And this is a privacy concern.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:20.820]   If you have an iPhone, it says there's somebody who got an AirTag near you that's not yours.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:24.180]   You might want to check that out.
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:27.300]   But the complaining about that was, well, you have to have an iPhone for that.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:33.220]   So Tracker Detect will help anybody who is not in the warm bath of the Apple ecosystem
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:37.300]   to identify unexpected airTags.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.780]   I like that phrase.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.780]   Exactly.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.780]   And surprise, surprise, AirTags.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.780]   We all like surprises.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:47.780]   You've got a surprise, AirTag.
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:51.540]   We're talking about that story in Ontario about a car theft ride.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.860]   It was basically sticking airTags on cars.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.620]   Yeah, I'm kind of surprised Apple didn't think of this to begin with.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:01.340]   The idea that, oh, and don't worry, we will protect the safety and security of all the
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.060]   Apple people, Android users, buy an iPhone, and you'll be safe.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.060]   It's like, oh, dear.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.060]   That seems like a good spot.
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:25.060]   It goes to a chair for non-
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.060]   It's unpredictable.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.060]   That's the biggest problem.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.060]   Sometimes it does.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.620]   Sometimes it doesn't.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:31.620]   Sometimes it annoys the hell out of you.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:38.340]   But I was in Mexico every time I left my airTag in my luggage, every time I left my hotel
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.340]   room.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.340]   You left your luggage behind.
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:42.340]   Yes, I know.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.420]   Thank you.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.900]   You left your car in the driveway.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:45.900]   Really?
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:46.900]   Really?
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.900]   I always think I have so many devices that I'm leaving behind.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.540]   I'm always, what I think funny is it's always picks one.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.460]   Oh, by the way, you use your other phone.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.660]   I was like, OK, what about the iPad and all the other things that were all the headsets,
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.460]   and then, but it'll pick a different one all the time.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:03.540]   Like, by the way, you left your headset back there, but not the phone that I liked the
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.540]   first time.
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:07.540]   I mean, the thought is nice, right?
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.540]   You don't want to leave you.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.540]   It's not the case.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:10.540]   It's not the case.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.820]   Here's the, I'm running this on the Pixel 6.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:14.820]   It's hard to find.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:19.100]   I have to say that's Android's search in the app store.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:23.380]   But if you search, actually what I would do is search for Apple apps, and you'll find
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.380]   it there.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:29.980]   So, tracker detect looks for tracker items that are separated from their owner and a
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.420]   compatible with Apple's Find My Network.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:37.580]   If you think someone's using AirTag or another device to track your location, you can scan
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:38.580]   and try to find it.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.220]   Let's press the scan button.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.420]   See what comes up.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.700]   Did I allow it?
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.340]   Scanning, scanning.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:50.500]   There's at least one tracker next to me.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.860]   It's on my keys.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:22:00.740]   Okay, well, this is only a couple hours show, so we'll get back to scanning a little later
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.500]   in the show.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.500]   Scanning.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.500]   Scanning.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:11.100]   It was an episode of Linus Tech Tips where one of his employees put an Apple tag in him
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.060]   to track him, and he found it in his pocket, and he just put it down.
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.060]   Didn't even think about it.
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.380]   Just assumed his kids found it on a desk somewhere and stuck it in his pants while he
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:19.380]   wasn't wearing them.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:21.860]   So, Jake, just shows that nobody's really that security consciousness.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.060]   Nobody cares.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:30.020]   Let's talk about the new iOS 15.2.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.700]   Of course, I think most Apple people are this way.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.820]   Whenever there's an update, I do it.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.540]   I just jump into it fearlessly.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:41.180]   Perhaps that's not the best attitude, but so far it's worked.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.700]   What's new in iOS 15.2?
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:50.180]   We got the Music Voice Plan, which is a cheap way to use Apple Music, right?
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.180]   Especially if you're not in a tent.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.020]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:58.340]   You don't get the app.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.820]   You only get through the voice interface.
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:05.300]   So it's great if you bought one of those cheap home pods after they discontinue them.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.580]   No, the big old ones were discontinued.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.580]   The little ones are...
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.580]   Sorry.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.580]   The meetings are still out, right?
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:12.580]   Yep.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.580]   Oh, God.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:14.580]   And their colors now, Leo.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.580]   Sorry.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.580]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.580]   There are colors.
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:22.820]   Music based on your listening history, likes or dislikes, play it again, lets you access
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   your list of recently played music.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.820]   What is it?
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:27.820]   Five bucks?
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.820]   Oh, by the way.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.460]   You can see where Apple's put their effort in this too, because if you say, like, play
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:36.340]   the opera by Andy and Aco, and it's not in your library, it'll say, "Oh, the opera by
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.700]   Andy and Aco is not in your library.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:41.500]   Would you like to have a free trial of Apple Music, the clever plan?"
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.460]   And then you immediately get your Apple, your Andy and Aco opera, you get your free
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.460]   trial.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.060]   The smoothest conversion thing I have ever seen.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:54.900]   So by the way, it found no trackers, even though there's one right here.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.300]   Right here.
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.300]   Right here.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.700]   It even says Leo on it.
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:00.700]   Okay.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:04.780]   So, you know, if somebody were, you know...
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.780]   If Lisa was tracking you right now...
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:10.540]   If somebody were stalking me, I'll keep scanning and we'll see.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.380]   Privacy, Apple's privacy report now is in settings, which I think is a good thing to do.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:19.940]   And this is maybe the tamping down you were talking about, Alex.
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:24.340]   If apps have access, how often they've access location photos, camera, microphone, contacts
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:28.100]   and mortising the last seven days, that's very, I think that's very, very valuable, very
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.100]   useful.
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.540]   And you can see some of that also.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:35.740]   I think as a developer, I think some of us got updates of the terms of service, and there's
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.740]   definitely, you can just see all these little screws getting turned.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.740]   Yep.
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:42.740]   So, you know, again, I think it's just you don't tighten them all at one time.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:43.740]   You just keep tightening them.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:44.740]   You just slowly moving around.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.300]   Boil the frog, baby.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.300]   Boil the frog.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:48.300]   Yep.
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.300]   Yep.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:53.900]   Messages will now, if you turn it on, let you know that your kids are looking at nudies.
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:58.460]   It won't let you know anymore, but it'll give the kids three chances to do what's right.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.020]   Oh, it doesn't tell the parent?
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.900]   No, they turned off the title feature because they were afraid that it would out people
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.820]   in conditions where they had abuse of parents.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:05.820]   Oh.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.900]   But it does give parents the ability to enable warnings for children.
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:09.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:13.060]   So, parents have to turn it on and then the kids get...
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.060]   No.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:16.060]   It won't tattle tail anymore.
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:19.140]   You don't really want to see naked butts, do you?
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.860]   But that's valuable.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.020]   Sometimes people, sometimes maybe their friends are going to send them something that they
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:25.020]   don't know what's coming.
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.020]   Well, it's also...
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.460]   It could be a bullying thing as well.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.580]   You could send it to somebody else who doesn't want to get that kind of...
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.580]   I don't want it.
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:37.100]   There was legitimately a bunch of people, predominantly women, on Twitter when this feature
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.740]   was announcing, "Why can't we adults have it?"
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.700]   You have no idea what we go through on a daily basis across all of our messages.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:43.700]   You know what?
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:45.560]   That's actually a very good point.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.220]   All they need is a hot dog or not hot dog detector.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.220]   Yes.
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.220]   Literally.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.360]   If you know what I mean.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.580]   And that would be very useful for everybody.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:58.580]   I don't want to get too deep into this but there's a brilliant video by Alana Pierce.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.500]   There used to be a really well-known games journalist.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.020]   Now she works for Santa Monica Studios where she got so upset that she would just keep
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.220]   a directory of the images and then always send back one that was slightly larger.
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:12.780]   Because that would aggravate people so much they never send messages again.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:14.140]   A slightly bigger hot dog.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.140]   There's always a big...
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:16.140]   Whatever you center.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.780]   Something I've learned in my life, there's always a bigger hot dog.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:22.100]   And she said they just couldn't handle that and she's like a moment of redemption.
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:23.100]   No.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.100]   That's totally it.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.460]   But it'd be way better if I just filtered that out.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:32.380]   There is in my favorite TV show, "Succession," a wonderful incident around that.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.860]   It's just very, very funny.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.460]   If you aren't watching that TV show, you really ought to.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.460]   It's very good.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.460]   Okay.
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.700]   So we'll call it the hot dog, not hot dog app.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.620]   Siri and search, expanded guidance and Siri spotlight.
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:50.580]   And Safari search to help children and parents stay safe online and get help with unsafe
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.580]   situations.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   How does it do that?
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.580]   We don't know?
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.380]   It pops out like if you do a search for a term that, you know, it's a problematic term
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:02.460]   basically like something that involves abusive stuff.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:04.540]   It'll pop up and say, yeah.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.140]   Would you like to be explaining this?
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.620]   Would you like information on this?
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:12.620]   We'd like to contact somebody to hear resources that you can go to.
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:18.180]   They've turned on digital legacy, which is really, really good for people my age.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:24.420]   Let's you designate somebody as a legacy contact so they can access your iCloud account and
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:30.260]   information in the event of your untimely passing because all passings are untimely.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.180]   That's a good thing.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.980]   Not your iTunes library though.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.500]   No, I'm getting to your iTunes library.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:40.380]   And I presume if you had iBooks, you probably wouldn't get to pass those longer iTunes.
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:45.060]   No, because remember you spent $23 on a movie that you don't actually own.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:46.060]   You just bought a license.
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.260]   The license is licensed.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:52.980]   But your personal stuff, which is just photos, contacts, financials, good.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.460]   The docs, yeah.
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.460]   Just presented proof of death has to be presented, but yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:04.140]   The switch that we talked about, the Marquez Brownlee switch, they're calling it, that
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:12.140]   lets you turn off macro mode if you don't like that annoying switch.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.140]   Just stop me through.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:19.100]   Does that mean that you can now manually choose which macro mode you're in?
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.100]   Yes.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.420]   You have a little, you have a little flower icon that you press to put into macro mode.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.660]   Now it doesn't do it automatically on proximity anymore.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.900]   It was switching lenses.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:28.900]   And it was bugging people.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:35.100]   I have to admit I got this nasty little splinter in my foot and I literally use the macro
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.100]   mode.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.100]   Perfect.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:43.500]   I did a macro mode and then I wired it to my big TV.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.180]   So I had this super high at the bottom of my foot.
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:51.380]   I put it on tripod and I set this whole thing up with big lights and everything else because
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.460]   I had to get it out.
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.460]   It was really a long part of my foot.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.060]   Were you doing microsurgery kind of?
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:02.380]   Yeah, I was totally doing microsurgery with my, I had like a little, I had this little
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:05.220]   needle and I had a, I can't believe you didn't have video of this.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.220]   I wish, I wish I would see that.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:13.580]   I should have, I don't know if anyone else else was focused on Alex's feet.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:18.220]   I was like, I was like, I could say is a, a, it worked really, really well.
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:22.020]   Like it, it totally, you know, because I was literally looking at like one centimeter of
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.620]   my, of my foot while I was working on it.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.460]   And so number one is it worked really well.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.980]   And number two is I really need to exfoliate more.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.980]   Next stage.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.980]   Next stage.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.540]   But you could do a little brain surgery on yourself.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:35.540]   Something like that.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:36.540]   I think I could.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.260]   I think now that I understand how the macro works, brain surgery is next, you know, it's
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   absolutely.
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.260]   And you really don't while you're doing brain surgery, you want it to flip back and forth
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:46.340]   between the wide and, and by the way, I didn't have to wire it.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.340]   All I had to do is share it.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.820]   You know, I shared it.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:49.820]   You know, I just shared it.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.820]   I just had it.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.340]   And so I just played during my phone to the airplane to the screen.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.540]   And then I just had this and I got into macro, but I will say the one problem was it kept
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.100]   on changing the macro mode.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.740]   And so you had to kind of see in just three places.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.740]   That's right.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.820]   Well, you can use a magnifier and accessibility.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.220]   It does a really good job too.
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.820]   But I was originally against this clay.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.220]   Love how automatic it was.
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:13.580]   And then Ray Wong pointed out that yes, but I want to take a photo where the object in
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.220]   front is blurred out is right.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.340]   And the object in back is in focus.
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:18.340]   And you can't do that anymore.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.540]   And I was like, Oh, yeah, waste part of the money.
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.220]   It's good to have stuff that's got switches.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:24.700]   It's good.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.660]   It's good.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:29.540]   The TV app has changed.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:35.060]   The store tab lets you browse, buy and rent movies and TV shows all in one place.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.660]   Okay.
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:37.660]   My.
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:41.860]   And some people were complaining that there was eight tabs for the store essentially before.
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.620]   Like you had basically what was new and then eight versions of the store tab.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:49.860]   And now there's they simplified it because it really is just the store and it's and the
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.460]   what's new in the this the search tab.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:53.700]   It's so simpler.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:31:00.660]   I have to say I was asking a friend of mine, his five kids if they are into the Charlie
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.300]   Brown Christmas, he said, I can't find anymore.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.780]   Where to go?
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.300]   And I had to tell him.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.300]   It's him.
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:09.300]   It's in the Apple.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.500]   It's gone to Cupertino.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.500]   It's gone to Cupertino.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.140]   Santa has moved Charlie in the company and moved to Cupertino.
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:20.260]   See that big bag, Santa's holding its bag of cash.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:21.260]   They did.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.660]   I mean, to their credit, if you see, I don't think anybody can figure out how to watch
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.380]   broadcast TV anymore.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:31.180]   But if you know what day and time it is on public television, you can watch it.
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:32.420]   I would never know when that is.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.420]   How would you know?
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:36.380]   Like all I know is that I, yeah, I don't I don't even know.
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:41.580]   Like I in YouTube TV, I kind of go in and for most things, I just select all everything.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.460]   I have so many things selected that there's just so much content.
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:48.700]   I guess, and I think that this is a I don't know if this is a problem for everybody, but
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.300]   for me, I'm so far behind in content all the time.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:56.340]   Like there are so many things I want to watch that the I if something that isn't like right
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.340]   down.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.340]   I agree.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:01.020]   Well, but but but also or exactly what I want.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:05.260]   Like I just I feel like there's a thousand other things for me to be watching, you know,
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:10.140]   that I have on my playlist, like my YouTube playlist right now, just YouTube, not YouTube
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.140]   TV.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:16.280]   And my playlist is like 30 hours deep, you know, like and I, you know, I just finally
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:20.980]   made it through when it was the sound the cinematic sound or whatever.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.900]   Yeah, last night, but that took me a week.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:31.020]   So as a public service to all the people who love Charlie Brown Christmas December 19th,
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.620]   730 p.m. on PBS.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.180]   That's your one shot.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:40.860]   Of course you could you could set up a trial on Apple TV and watch it.
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.940]   You get a seven day trial.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:45.980]   Charlie Brown, otherwise known as Caribbean enthusiasm for kids.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:49.100]   Yeah, you know, I was watching it because I love it.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.100]   I love them.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.540]   You know what I really love is the Vince Garaldi music is so good.
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.980]   Yeah, so.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:58.220]   But I was watching and I realized, I don't know why I never thought of this when I was
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:32:59.220]   a kid.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:02.700]   I guess I just thought, Oh, it's Charlie Brown, but it's really just a bunch of static comic
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.860]   strips turned in rendered in the animation.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:10.820]   So there's set up punchline, set up punchline, set up punchline all the way through.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:16.020]   And then Lucy goes, or Charlie goes, and then the next one.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:19.900]   So it's really kind of, it's a little bit dated, I have to say.
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:22.380]   Well, I would say classic.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:26.780]   I'm glad that I'm glad that it's it's it's contemplative.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780]   It's meditative.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:32.020]   It's thoughtful as opposed to like we got to have three action sequences and Tony Stark
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.020]   has to be responsible.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.260]   No, yeah, you're right.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.260]   You're right.
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.700]   It's it is a much more leisurely pace.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:43.020]   There's a lot of causes and dead air.
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:44.620]   By the way, I'm reading this on expectations.
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.380]   I'm reading this on a subvert expectations.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.220]   I'm reading this on masslive.com.
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:54.860]   And it says locally, Massachusetts viewers can tune in on GBH to catch PBS specials.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:55.860]   So there you go.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.020]   That's for you, Andrew.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.380]   Thank you for your donation, your support.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.180]   We brought to you bring you the Charlie Brown.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.620]   My view is like you.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.700]   You'll have to bring your own Dolly Madison snack case.
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:10.460]   Oh, man, that's the one thing missing from the Apple TV version.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.460]   And I presume.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:18.620]   Although I host this bought apparently Dolly Madison and they so they make they make Dolly
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.340]   they make zingers now.
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:24.420]   And so only like in my adult life was I able to do live out the fantasy that I had as a
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:28.940]   child say, well, gee, we can't why they keep saying Dolly Madison zingers.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.460]   I've never seen a zinger.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.460]   Have you ever seen a zinger?
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.820]   No, we don't have a zinger.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:39.540]   Thanks to the host us antitrust case, we now can have Dolly Madison singers.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.740]   You know, sometimes the good guys do win.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.740]   Yes.
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:48.820]   Let me let me just play a little of this for those of you who won't be seeing it in your
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.820]   Charlie Brown.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:53.420]   I've got a treat that's heavenly like me.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.420]   Dolly Madison cupcakes.
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:35:01.900]   Ah, don't more like me because they're devilishly delicious doubles with cake, but it has
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:04.900]   creamy cream filling that goodness like me.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:09.220]   Look at this tempting chocolate ice, but it has angel writing on it.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.220]   See, right?
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.220]   They're more like you.
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.740]   I have more of them.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.700]   You can't believe you.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.700]   Dolly Madison cupcakes.
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:20.100]   I think that was probably shown on the.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.100]   It's a great pumpkin.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.820]   Oh, God, rather than that that kid went places.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.580]   I want to know what happened to him.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:30.940]   He made a meal out of that that that role and he did a great job.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   He really did.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.660]   He probably I wonder if he went on to great things.
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:40.820]   You can actually you can actually watch the YouTube also has the one with the peanuts
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.820]   gang in it.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:42.820]   Here we go.
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:46.940]   The zingers apple is someone in this room to find the culprit.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.100]   I'll put zingers on his plate.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.500]   This is this is when zingers came along, which look.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.500]   Oh, wow.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:56.380]   These have a strip of frosting.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:02.660]   They look just like hostess cupcakes and and Twinkies.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:04.860]   I guess it's going to be there.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:09.420]   There are no raspberry coconut Twinkies and the world is the poor for it.
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:15.260]   See, it's it's the competition that led to innovation within the snack cake industry.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:19.340]   There are improvements even in car play.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.340]   Enhanced city map.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:26.140]   I actually really like this with road details like turn lanes, medians, bike lanes.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:30.340]   You crosswalks, but it's only in supported cities is not yet in Petaloma.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.060]   The details caught in really good.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:36.060]   Like I was just walking around my neighborhood and it was like I felt almost bad about it.
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.460]   Because I could see way too much detail like the surface of the pool and where the cars
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.460]   were placed.
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.380]   I'm just like, it's a little too intimate at this point.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.540]   A bunch of other little minor things.
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:53.580]   I imagine there there besides feature editions, there are bug fixes and security fixes.
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:56.300]   I'll leave it to you to to do the research.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.220]   Even the TVOS was updated.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.260]   Everything's 15 to got the watch update.
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:03.260]   All of that.
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.540]   The new the new stuff is here.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:14.140]   Adobe has launched a version of its creative cloud that's free creative cloud express,
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.140]   which really mostly looks like a bunch of templates.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:20.700]   There are paid templates and free templates.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.420]   It looks like a thing for creating memes, for creating Instagram posts.
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:26.420]   It's nice.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:31.700]   I mean, we as a kid, I had Print Shop, which we had our own printout, print on a Panasonic
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.700]   1080i printer.
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.700]   But okay.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:36.140]   It's just not great.
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:41.340]   Quickly and easily make standout content from thousands of beautiful templates.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.020]   I guess that's what people want though, right?
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.020]   They just want templates.
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.900]   I guess the thing I would get it done.
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:46.900]   Just get it done.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:47.900]   Web.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:49.100]   It's also available on mobile.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.420]   I mean, a web as well as on mobile.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:55.540]   I think it's also available on Microsoft's app store.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:58.580]   So pretty much everywhere you can get your apps.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:02.300]   It's a big improvement where people trying to hand write their signs or do them.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:04.300]   Moreably in something like.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.020]   At first when I saw it, I was like really like, same thing they had.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.020]   I was like, really?
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:13.100]   But then I watched my wife put together our Christmas cards with some template from Walgreens.
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.700]   You know, like, like it just, you know, she threw it together.
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:16.860]   She doesn't want to spend a lot of time on it.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.580]   I wasn't willing to spend any time on it.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:21.860]   So, so the, so it went out and it looks fine.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.260]   You know, like it's not, it's not, no one's going to win any awards, but it's better than
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.980]   her trying to get a hand made.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.980]   Or is it?
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:32.340]   Well, it's better than, it's better than doing something digital.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.900]   It's kind of janky that doesn't really work.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:39.700]   I mean, handmade handmade, like crafted is would be better, but, but as far as something
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:42.300]   that's probably got time for that.
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.540]   Like when Kevin Smith goes and protests his own movies, you got to make sparkles.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.540]   Exactly.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:52.260]   Well, I mean, it's like, it's like, like cooked bread is great, but sometimes the best thing
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:55.340]   someone can do is get a bread maker, like gorgeous by a loaf of bread.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.700]   So, you know, so it's, they may not be able to make it.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.980]   It's just better than nothing.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.980]   Exactly.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:02.980]   Or bad.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:06.620]   They should, but they should definitely release a companion app just for, because, because Adobe
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.260]   products serve the creative community, a companion app is a phone app.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:15.180]   You scan this thing that you just paid somebody $180 to design for you.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:18.820]   Say, Hey, wait a minute, you did, you made this with a template with that free Photoshop
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:19.820]   app.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.620]   You didn't hire a real design professional for this.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:23.620]   How many of us have watched?
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:28.100]   I mean, I don't know if you, I know the Apple music library really well, you know, all the
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.100]   loops.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:33.060]   And so I can tell like, I can immediately hear it in a commercial.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.780]   Like, oh, they're using the Apple loop.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.780]   That's an Apple loop.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:36.780]   That's an Apple loop.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:38.780]   You know, like, you know, like, you don't know that right.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:39.780]   Right.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.780]   Exactly.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.580]   These are actually not, these are not bad.
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.580]   These templates.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:48.620]   You know, you can easily, you know, they look, they look, they're professionally designed,
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.620]   right?
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.620]   Meal delivery free, you know, and it's for, it's for small businesses and people like
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.620]   it was like that.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:55.980]   That stuff can totally work.
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:01.340]   I'm just, I'm just always a little bit disappointed when I get, when I get my pizza box and it
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:05.940]   says, our name, your neighborhood pizza place made this hot and fresh for you.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.180]   Oh, and what would the name of that place be your look?
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.180]   Thanks for buying local.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:13.340]   Like this is the, of course they, I know they buy these in bulbous.
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.220]   Like I'm much, I don't have just a blank, I'm much, I don't have like the generic, you
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:22.500]   know, chef, stereotypical Italian chef's kid's guy rather than try to, try to make me think
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.380]   that this is a custom printed thing.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.380]   This is, this is cool.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.460]   They have animated ones too for your Instagram.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:29.500]   So here's a study tip.
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.660]   I can modify that and make it.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.580]   And when you look at this, a lot of these, a lot of these are the kind of thing with TikTok
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:38.340]   that the people are using the filters or they're using some kind of overlay.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.340]   Yeah.
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:41.820]   I recognize a lot of the TikTok stuff now.
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.140]   This is at least giving you a whole bunch of new things.
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:47.140]   A lot of the eye movie and final cut stuff too.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:48.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.140]   People use templates because they're easy.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:52.140]   And this is how this, this is not just presentation.
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:55.820]   It really is communication at this point where, so when you have private reels, it's like,
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:58.980]   this is how you talk to your, your two dozen friends that are close enough that you're
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.860]   going to share like eight different moments during the day.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:05.340]   And you want to see it even, even there, if you want to present like a really cool, like
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:09.020]   here's exactly what I'm trying to tell you as opposed to, oh no, this is not worth, this
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.540]   is not worth finding my stylus form.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:12.140]   It's going to tap something into a template.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.140]   And it's fine.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.700]   I mean, I have the government does illegal stuff and comic songs and a PowerPoint template.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:16.700]   I mean, that's always the best.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:19.380]   Like you get to see a military document that gets leaked and has say something and it's
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.540]   in comic songs.
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:21.900]   It was meant to be ironic.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:27.340]   I don't think nothing better than the use of ironic comic sense.
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:30.060]   Well, you know, the funny thing goes that you think of it like templates, but there's
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:34.300]   like eight gifts that I use probably at least once a week, you know, like, and they're not,
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:38.340]   I don't, I don't go out and shoot my own video to do the meme.
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:39.900]   I just really like that meme.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:40.900]   I've just made it.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:43.300]   Look, I just made this while you were talking.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.500]   I made my new Mac break weekly.
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.580]   It's not just about the Nutella.
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:49.580]   How about that?
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.580]   You like that?
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:54.420]   It's not about the, it's not about the Nutella at all.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:55.420]   Okay.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.660]   It's not just it's not about the Nutella.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:05.660]   It's not about dog or not hot dog Nutella that would not be a good show.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:11.340]   If I, if I have a vote and that's just when I do, I'm not that one.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:12.900]   How about not do we get into this?
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:14.940]   People are listening to this going, what is going on?
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.540]   They all know they're not.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:17.540]   They know.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.020]   Anyway, that's, I think this is nice.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.940]   And I just, that was completely free.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.300]   I didn't pay for it.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:23.300]   Creative cloud express.
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.300]   People didn't ruin our energies.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:29.140]   I was like, we have these innocent little emojis and humanity keeps ruining them.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.980]   Why can't an egg play?
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.820]   Just being like, plan.
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:34.820]   I know.
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.580]   Oh, the kids do it anymore.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:38.140]   Like the kids are way too advanced for me.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.020]   I find out like once in a while there's an article about what these emoji really mean
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.020]   and I'm flabbergasted.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.740]   I did not use it with that intent.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:50.060]   Mac OS Monterey 12.1 share as you mentioned, share play just in time for the holidays.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.780]   We can watch Charlie bound together.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.740]   Share play now is like a little bit like it's a little bit much like to go through all that
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.020]   to like, it's, it's fun and it's great.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:02.220]   We would have been great during the pandemic, but I can't wait till that's part of Apple's
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:03.220]   VR helmet.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.060]   And like we can just be sitting there going, Alex, you want to watch the new Iron Man
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.060]   fire with me?
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.060]   Yeah, sure.
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:09.060]   We press it.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.500]   That is a trope in a lot of science fiction.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:14.380]   And I think I can give credit to Amy Webb, our futurist for coming up with that.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:18.740]   You see this now in a lot of shows where they say, let me just throw you that data or throw
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:23.460]   you that video and they like with the zoon and it squirts and it comes in on your gla,
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.340]   on your regular every day, spectacles.
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.780]   I think that will be the future.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:27.780]   I think you're right.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.540]   I'm going to splatter you a movie, Alex.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:32.100]   And he's going to splatter you a lot.
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.100]   I just think of scale.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.820]   You know, like I was just like 32 is cute up to 32 is cute.
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:39.980]   But I was like, what if you could, you know, basically build on virtual theater for a lot
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:40.980]   of people to watch it?
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.460]   Yeah, it's an interesting one.
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.460]   It's fine.
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:46.620]   I'm just like, I, so immediately with like, sure, we were tools using Netflix party.
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.060]   Yeah, no, there is not.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.100]   No, 32 is a tenth of a, of an office.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:57.700]   So, yeah, yeah, the, the, we did, we did, we used Netflix party to do about 90.
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:03.300]   And the problem with Netflix party is that it, it, it's too chatty.
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:07.780]   So it, it, and so it needs to be a different kind of architecture to make that work.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:11.780]   But you know, I was thinking, you know, what if you had 2000 people watching together and
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.300]   then being able to text back and forth and discuss things, it wouldn't be the first time
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.780]   you watched the movie, but it might be like, oh, we've all watched it and all lots of
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.780]   watching together and talk about it.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.140]   The bad thing about share plays that it ducks the movie of somebody talks and like,
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:24.140]   that is a huge problem.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:27.660]   It's like, kind of like your family and friends, but like the kids now put on, you know, like,
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:31.340]   subtitles because they can't stand the adults talking over the show all the time.
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:34.060]   See, I just put subtitles on.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:37.620]   I just put the subtitles on because I like Christopher Nolan movies and I'd really like
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.820]   to know what it was actually happening.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:39.820]   Yes.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:40.820]   Yes.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:41.820]   Not that I'm bitter.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:42.820]   But, but, but you're right.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:43.820]   It is a lot.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.300]   There's, there is a lot of possibility there.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:49.580]   Roger Ebert used to do like multiple times a year, but always at the, uh, Congressmen
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:52.660]   World Affairs, the University of Colorado, uh, what did he call them?
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:57.140]   Cinema Interruptives where they would put on like Citizen Kane or some, whatever the, the
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.460]   movie was chosen for, for the year.
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:04.180]   The first night, like a thousand people in that auditorium would just watch it.
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.420]   And then over the next four nights, they were played again.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:10.900]   But anytime somebody had a question or comment, they just shut out, stop and then make that
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:11.900]   comment or question.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.660]   And then everybody in the room would discuss it and Roger would discuss it.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.860]   And it was a great, aggressive, especially with Roger Ebert.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:20.540]   That would be amazing.
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.540]   It was amazing.
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:25.740]   The only problem with that, it became like around day three when everybody's really
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:28.900]   loosened up and it would be like, stop.
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.780]   Roger, I once took a film studies class 18 years ago.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:36.860]   And I would like to demonstrate that in front of my favorite movie critic.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:37.860]   Hate that.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:41.860]   It was like, no, that, but he was always very, he was always very, very kind.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:47.420]   When I was in college, uh, the film society, filmmakers would come.
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:50.940]   Pretty big filmmakers would come with their film and then answer questions.
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.460]   I always loved that.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:53.460]   That was really cool.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.460]   That was really cool.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.460]   You could do that, you know, with that.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.460]   When that be is.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:02.020]   Is that you wouldn't be breaking any copyright laws.
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:03.340]   We've been trying literally.
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.260]   So the first time we actually did this was with Pixelcore 20 years ago with a DVD.
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:08.660]   But you broke up in the laws.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:10.660]   No, no, we didn't.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:11.660]   We did break the copyright laws.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:12.660]   We said everybody started DVD.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:13.660]   Start your DBE.
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.660]   Start your wizard of Oz to any Star Wars.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:18.100]   Start the moon at the same time.
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:19.100]   Right.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:23.500]   When I had it was like, I was going to, I just walked everybody through Star Wars.
[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:24.820]   And so, you know, the one that worked on.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:26.820]   So I was just like, start all the way.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:27.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:32.100]   And then we talked about, but the key is that you could do it so much bigger.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:34.740]   And the company to do it is the problem.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:38.780]   Because you could, but everybody have to start at the same time.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.780]   No, no, no, no.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:45.780]   But that's why the Netflix party slash whatever would be better is to be able to scale this
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.780]   up.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.580]   And the thing that Apple could do that no one else can do is build it into the player architecture
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:54.340]   for anybody building an app for Apple.
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:55.740]   So that anybody could do it.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.740]   Not just Apple TV, that any Netflix or whatever.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:59.740]   I'll start out with it.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:00.740]   Is TikTok doing it?
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:01.740]   There's a bunch of them.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:04.700]   Yeah, YouTube hasn't said anything yet, but TikTok launched for that in a bunch of other
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:05.700]   apps.
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.740]   Now, what would be really smart is if you could independently pause it and then it would
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.940]   slowly increase the speed when you unpause it to catch you up with everybody.
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:14.140]   It would be like, imperceptibly faster.
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:16.340]   And it's like, Renee Richie's audio today.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.340]   It would be great.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:18.340]   I'm so sorry.
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:19.340]   I don't know.
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.340]   I'm teasing it.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.340]   There is, this is completely tangential.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:29.220]   But you mentioned Christopher Nolan and using subtitles as more and more of us do these
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:30.220]   days.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:34.100]   And I thought it's just because I'm getting old, but Slashfilm had a great article.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:35.380]   Thanks Ben Pearson.
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:39.260]   Here's why movie dialogue has gotten more difficult to understand.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.220]   And then he has three proposals, but it's a lot of different things.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:45.620]   One, there's Mr. Nolan himself.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:48.700]   And it's a purposeful choice in his part.
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:55.900]   You know, who started this as Robert Altman with Nashville and yeah, but cabin, Mrs. Miller,
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:59.180]   this he said, this is that people don't you can't hear everybody.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.180]   You got overlap.
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.140]   Mash remember, mash all that overlapping.
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:03.820]   That's why I go to movies though.
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:04.980]   I know I want to.
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:08.100]   Well, he also says, Pearson says, it's the acting.
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:11.700]   You got to, you know, Christopher Nolan saying, well, Baines were in a mask.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:16.380]   So you can't understand him, but actors are also mumbling more.
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:19.540]   And he says partly this is Bain is not realistic to begin with Leo.
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:20.740]   So just like do that for me.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:21.740]   Make him tell it.
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:22.740]   Oh, sure.
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:23.740]   I'll put it on.
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.380]   Bush, breaker in his mask.
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:33.860]   They also say somewhat of it is the problem that the the recordist either doesn't have
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:40.980]   enough status to say I didn't get that stop could, you know, stop mumbling or that the
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.740]   record is just isn't respected on the set and is right.
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:44.740]   Don't care.
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:45.740]   Yeah, they don't care.
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:46.740]   We're moving on moving on.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:47.740]   We'll fix it.
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:50.900]   I know that's pretty that's pretty simplistic view of it.
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:55.020]   I mean, I the the record is if you don't record it on site and you can't understand that
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:49:01.580]   you use ADR and ADR is like for most movies, not not movies, but for most movies, ADR is
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:04.900]   like I had a cent 60% and I had a sound guy call the radio show.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.180]   And I was talking about this.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:07.420]   This he does ADR.
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.460]   It's exactly what he says.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:12.260]   That's where you go back, get the accuracy and you rerecord the track.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:14.620]   Obviously that costs money and it's, you know, it's not.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:17.460]   Yeah, but for a big film, when we're talking about big films, you're going to do it anyway.
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.380]   It's not it's not a it's a lot of money.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:24.980]   It's not a big percentage of money like compared to what everything that they do to do those
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:25.980]   things.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:31.220]   It's the it's so loud that well, that's another thing Ben Pearson brings up.
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.980]   By the way, if it's simplistic, it's because I have simplified his arguments.
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:36.660]   He goes into many more words about all this.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:39.020]   He says part is also technology.
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.180]   He quotes he interviewed a lot of sound people.
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:45.220]   Some of them who wanted to be anonymous, one high profile sound professional who wishes
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.620]   to remain anonymous points the evolution of technology is an ingredient.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:52.860]   The reason people don't remember having these same audio issues with older films is that
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.380]   we have more tracks to play with, more options.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.340]   Therefore more expected and asked from the sound editors.
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:01.980]   He says, if you listen to the four weddings in a funeral, you'll hear every word because
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:04.780]   the sound was cut on film back then.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:13.060]   Well, and also there's a lot of mixers that are the a lot of them are experimenting with
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:15.820]   how they're where they put voices in the channels.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:19.500]   If you don't put it in the center channel, if you don't drop it.
[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.700]   The problem is that a lot of us now have surround.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:27.020]   We have sound bars or we have some version of five one or seven one or whatever, or it
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.220]   could even be that folded into stereo.
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.700]   The problem is they start doing things like, oh, we want to put it in the left and right
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.460]   channel rather than down the center.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:37.660]   That creates a really muddy track.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.380]   What's interesting about it is that now there are some movies like we thought about seeing
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:46.580]   James Bond in the theater, but there was a bunch of comments about not being able to
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:47.580]   understand what people were saying.
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:49.580]   So we're like, oh, we'll just wait until it's at home.
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:51.580]   Because we could turn on the captions.
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.060]   No, no, no, because we could turn on the captions.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.060]   I can just turn the captions.
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:02.620]   So I was like, so now if there's any review that says this is hard to understand, that
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.900]   means watch it at home.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.380]   You know, for a lot of people now.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:09.620]   Well, and that's another thing he says is that, you know, sometimes they're mixed on
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:14.460]   a sound stage, but then you get it to the multiplex and it sounds like crap.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:16.300]   Maybe your home theater is better.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:21.780]   Yeah, there's a lot of this is a really, really very good article talking about all of the
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:25.620]   things because I've just basically said, you know, the shorthand is, well, they're mixing
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:26.620]   for seven one.
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.620]   And, you know, if you don't have a good sound system, you're going to miss them.
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:30.620]   Turn up your seven.
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:31.620]   You're missing the one and it's the dialogue.
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:32.620]   I'm missing the one.
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.500]   Yeah, turn up the center channel.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:35.580]   But I look for you.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:36.580]   No dialogue.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:39.900]   And I have to say more and more people are watching the closed captions, which is going
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:43.740]   to hurt the movie theaters because you don't have them there, right?
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:46.700]   They actually, I've heard that people like it for the same reason that people like text
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:51.460]   on YouTube is that it forces a level of attention that's not always otherwise handed over.
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.420]   So like you might be, if you're listening to it, you might be moving around doing a bunch
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:57.940]   of things, looking at your phone, but the minute you can't hear something or you see
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.300]   text on screen, you stop and you start reading it.
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:02.020]   And that locks you into that experience.
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.660]   So there's super happy about it.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:07.900]   Yeah, there's some it's a it was a really good.
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:11.540]   I thought peace and that doesn't have anything to do with Apple or Max, but I know you guys
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.860]   are interested in this kind of stuff, especially Alex Ben Pearson.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.900]   Some of that Paul Greengrass stuff we need to script a audio as well because I can't
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:19.300]   tell what's happening in those fight scenes anymore.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:20.300]   Those fights are very.
[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.300]   So muddy edited.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.300]   That's my that's my problem.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.820]   That's one of my problems with Marvel movies.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:28.340]   It's just like, Oh, God, it's just going to be there's a there's a corner of the screen
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:29.860]   that doesn't have some crap in it.
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:31.940]   For God's sake, put some more CGI crap in there.
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:32.940]   Right.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.940]   Like, okay, whatever.
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:35.940]   Right.
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:38.780]   Xcode 13 to also came out.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:43.860]   Now this is my this is always my gripe that it's relatively quick to get, you know, the
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:49.780]   latest OS 10 or well as 11, but then you got to then it's so long to update Xcode and
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:56.780]   yes, there's a new Xcode and according to nine to five Mac, Felipe Esposito hints at upcoming
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:58.660]   Swift playgrounds for release.
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.820]   We've been talking about that.
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:06.980]   Very excited about playgrounds for it's not in there yet, but I guess there's features
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.140]   in the Xcode.
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:13.620]   The apps release notes say it adds compatibility with products projects created with Swiss
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:17.580]   playgrounds for so it must mean we're getting close.
[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:20.660]   Yeah, I hope it doesn't say spring on the website.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:21.660]   So that's a good.
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:24.700]   It will all be here in spring.
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.700]   Just be patient.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.700]   I'm looked.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:29.260]   I know I was as soon as I have, I went and looked through the rest of the features to
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:33.780]   make sure the word spring wasn't really sprinkled around anything in the spring.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:35.380]   Everything's in the spring.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.380]   Spring is coming.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.380]   Spring is coming.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:38.380]   Game of Thrones.
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:42.380]   The sequel spring is coming spring is that would be a much lighter game of throats.
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:43.820]   The Targaryens.
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:49.540]   I think the spinoff is a Targaryens, right, which is not going to be any lighter or more
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:50.540]   music.
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:51.540]   Oh, God.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.140]   Yeah, that's the dragon folk, right?
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:00.260]   All right, let's take one more break and then your picks of the week, if you would, prepare
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.540]   them, tune them up, polish them up.
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:08.820]   But first a word from our sponsor, AT&T active armor.
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.340]   Now, I know how it is.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:14.580]   You spent the day staring at your phone waiting for that one call.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:16.740]   You wait to hear about the job, right?
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:22.220]   I hope it's not the hospital, maybe the family saying we're coming or not.
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.140]   And it finally rings and what is it?
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:28.260]   All right, your car warranty is about to run out.
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:32.300]   I got one the other day and it said, you've been approved for financial aid.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.820]   Well, that's good.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.340]   I must be going back to school.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:41.100]   Look, the last thing you want when you're waiting for an important call or just want
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:46.100]   to play words with friends on your phone is a spam call.
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:48.340]   Don't let fraud calls disappoint you.

[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:20.940]   And now, Radei Richie with his perk of the week.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:25.540]   So I've made it a habit on the show of picking what I think are really interesting, creator
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:26.540]   driven projects.
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:31.000]   And this might be the most interesting one ever because Justina Zarek, I Justine, has
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000]   now got her own lightsaber.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000]   Oh, Lord.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.500]   Which is just the most fantastic thing.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.820]   Well, so she's been training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:37.820]   It looks so good.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.820]   It's been training Filipino with Screama.
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:40.820]   Look at her.
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:41.820]   Oh, man.
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:42.820]   Stick fighting.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:43.820]   She's knife fighting.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:46.580]   She's weaponized her talents into merchandise.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:49.420]   And what I love is that she didn't just make a lightsaber lightsaber.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:51.980]   She thought about the practicality of using it.
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:54.500]   It's like combat grade lightsaber.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:00.940]   It's not like it's got it like things to protect your hands.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:04.660]   It's made from a person who understands the basics of weapon craft too, which to me is
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.740]   like, again, endlessly fascinating.
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:08.820]   And she is really good with this stuff.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:12.740]   It turns out like those boxes, those next unboxings, they have no chance.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.180]   They used to have like a one in 10 chance that you get away from her.
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:18.540]   She's just going to murder those boxes from now on.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:22.780]   So I mean, these aren't an expensive $400 to $500.
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:28.420]   It comes with a standard combat grade 36 inch blade and saber sport bag.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:32.100]   Now the blade is not a sword blade.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:34.300]   Is it a glass tube?
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.300]   Because I wouldn't want to hit anybody.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:36.300]   Yeah.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.300]   Well, it's got a light thing.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:39.940]   But like it's not it's not like a laser sword.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:41.580]   You're not going to like you're not going to kill people.
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:42.780]   You can bludgeon them pretty good.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:45.340]   I imagine it's more for sure.
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.700]   But the options can also come.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:52.860]   She says with a Saboration exclusive Imperial Ripper blade.
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:54.420]   That's also black and silver.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:56.740]   That's when you get to $522.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.200]   That's wow.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.200]   These are beautiful.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.220]   I think you're going to put them on the wall though, right?
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.220]   You're not going to go.
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:08.540]   You might want to go out there and spin them.
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:13.460]   Yeah, I mean, like she put up a video too, like what she's actually using them.
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.420]   They look like so much fun.
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:21.420]   I got a when I used to do Wushu a long, long time ago, I did like a spear and double blades.
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:25.220]   And once you get into it, like, of course, like no one's really using for comedy anymore.
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:30.220]   But they're just really good exercise, really fun, a lot of coordination, a lot of cardio.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.220]   Yeah, you could use this for practice, right?
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.220]   Your fantasy.
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:40.980]   Yeah, Jedi and all pixels in pixel blades come with a one year warranty.
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:43.660]   I bet Darth Maul couldn't say that.
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.620]   No, Darth Molly.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.300]   We live long enough.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.300]   Excuse it.
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.500]   I just, you know, the funny thing was that I wanted to go get one.
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.780]   I mean, I'm going to go back and order one, but I wanted to go get one, but she took the
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.780]   whole site down.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:57.380]   Like she, she was, it crashed.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:00.660]   She put it up and the whole thing was like just gone, you know, like it was, it was, you
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.660]   know, you forget.
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:05.380]   I wish I could say we just took the site down, but it's pretty easy to get into.
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:06.380]   So go on in and.
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:08.580]   Well, I think it was, give us a kindly.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:11.860]   We, yeah.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:17.100]   There's VIP access to the IJ Army Base Camp community.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.500]   If you want to become a cadet.
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.140]   A padawan.
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:22.860]   A padawan learner.
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:25.380]   Wow, this is cool.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:26.380]   Very nice.
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:30.100]   They actually make other stuff too, but now they have an IJ version.
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:31.540]   So that's got to be better.
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:32.540]   Now she has a lightsaber.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:33.540]   Look at her.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:34.540]   Look at her.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.540]   She's so happy.
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.540]   I have a lightsaber.
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:38.180]   I love that right at the top.
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:39.340]   And you wonder what Jenna is doing.
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:41.140]   She's going, Justin, put down the lightsaber.
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:44.140]   We have Lego to finish.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:50.580]   Little did you know Alex Lindsay, when you ran into Justin Azerik at a, was it a WordPress
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:52.940]   camp in Pittsburgh?
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.980]   It was an un, what was it called?
[01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:56.420]   Un-camp or something like that?
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.420 --> 01:58:58.420]   Un-conference.
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:58:59.420]   That's what it was.
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:00.700]   It was the podcast, Un-conference in Pittsburgh.
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:01.700]   And she, what was she doing?
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:03.140]   She was just there saying, yeah.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.700]   She was there asking a lot of questions.
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:05.700]   It was funny.
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:07.740]   I was teaching, I was talking about podcasting.
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:09.420]   I was also talking about green screen.
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:12.500]   And the person with all the questions were, was, was just Dean.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:15.380]   I mean, she just had, and it wasn't like she was peppering me with you.
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:16.380]   So questions.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:19.780]   It was all like, she was really thinking, I'm really called Leo and I was like, okay, we
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:20.780]   found someone.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:21.780]   Yeah, I remember.
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:26.700]   You know, like, like, this is like, yeah, from the first moment, I was like, she's going
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:28.020]   to go, she's going to go big.
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:29.420]   You know, we got her.
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:30.660]   She was in early Mac bricks.
[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.740]   It was 15, 20 years, almost 20 years ago.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:35.740]   15 years ago.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:36.740]   And she still looks like she's 28.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:37.740]   I don't understand how she's done.
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.180]   She's a little bit of the rest of us.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:41.940]   We're the paintings in the attic.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:48.300]   Imperialsabers.com/product/ij.
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.260]   Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week.
[01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:53.100]   You've got two quick ones.
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:56.860]   One is that that we were just because we were talking about audio, making waves, which
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.540]   is about cinematic sound.
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.620]   I think it comes with the YouTube subscription.
[02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:05.620]   I never know what's free and what isn't free, but it's free for me anyway, but it's about
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:06.980]   cinematic sound.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:12.820]   A great walkthrough of the history of cinematic sound as well as really telling you all the
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:16.180]   things that happen and how it gets put together in like an hour, you know, an hour and a half
[02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:17.660]   or whatever.
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:18.660]   Really, really great.
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:22.300]   It's got Ben Burt and Walter Murch and a lot of other folks that are talking about it.
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:26.460]   A lot of the best, some of the top Gary Ridesstrom, a lot of the top folks talking about how they
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.980]   got into it and what it looked like and what happened.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:35.940]   And then it breaks down like how each part, there's basically seven components to a sound
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:41.300]   design for a modern movie and it breaks down what those are for you.
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:44.140]   So you really understand, because there's oftentimes different people working on each
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:45.500]   section of that.
[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.740]   And so it's really good.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:53.260]   And then the other thing that I chose also ZBrush, which is just got bought by Maxon today.
[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:56.900]   It's mostly that incredible application.
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:57.900]   It's been around for a long time.
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:03.620]   A lot of us have used it for one of the oldest tools, right?
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:06.580]   Well, definitely for what it does, we just painting in 3D.
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:11.420]   So basically what it lets you do is paint models in 3D, like make models from 3D or
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:13.900]   take your existing models and paint them.
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:17.740]   And literally when I say paint them, I don't mean paint textures onto them.
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:23.340]   You can do that, but really create new models and merge them and blur and push them around
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:24.340]   and everything else in 3D.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.580]   It's the most powerful app in that area.
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:31.140]   And it just got bought by Maxon, which has been kind of, they picked up Redshift and Redgiant.
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:34.260]   There's a lot of, they're picking up a lot of stuff.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:36.980]   They're picking up speed, I think.
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:42.300]   But a really, really great complimentary thing to what Maxon's already doing.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:43.300]   So it's exciting to see.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:44.740]   It'll be exciting to see what happens.
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:48.180]   But it wasn't something that's really as Mac-brake-y, but I think it's important for
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:49.180]   you to know that it's happening.
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:50.180]   It's for our industry.
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:51.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.180]   ZBrush, excited.
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:57.820]   Since 1997, I mean, this is one of the venerable tools in your toolkit.
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:03.020]   Yeah, and I'm hoping that some of it comes, the fact that they're owned by Maxon.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:06.420]   The interface was always built for a different kind of artist, like when it started.
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:11.460]   And so it has this roots of a very odd way of approaching modeling, which takes a long
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:13.300]   time to get your head around.
[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:17.140]   But they, so it'll be interesting to see if they make that a little bit more standard.
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:20.740]   Leave it probably the way it is, but take some of that technology and put it into a
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:21.740]   7-0, 4-0.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:22.740]   It'll be really interesting.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:27.140]   I think you did some ZBrush demos back and call for help days, I believe.
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:28.140]   I did.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.140]   Yeah.
[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:30.140]   I did.
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:31.140]   It's really, really powerful.
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:32.140]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:34.900]   I mean, it was, yeah, we definitely talked about it because there's just one.
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:40.580]   There's been a lot of other apps that are kind of in the forger and there's lots of other
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:41.860]   little apps that have done that.
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:46.260]   But this one is the, has always been the most popular one to do it in.
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:51.740]   Dwindel in our IRC says he's a ZBrush artist, he will miss, I don't know if they're going
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:55.180]   away, but he says the free lifetime free upgrades will be missed.
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:57.900]   I don't know if that means Maxon will be killing us or not.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:58.900]   No idea.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.900]   We don't know.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:00.900]   Yeah.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.460]   But yeah, things like that do go away.
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:03.460]   It's not unusual.
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:04.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:05.460]   Life time is only selling.
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:06.460]   Yeah.
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:07.460]   Right.
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:08.460]   So you don't have something to do with that.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:11.700]   You know, like, maybe that didn't turn out so well.
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:16.900]   And this documentary you're talking about, 90 minute documentary, making waves, the art
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:21.420]   of cinematic sound is, I'm getting it for free because I'm a YouTube premium subscriber.
[02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:23.740]   So I think that's so my, so that's why I couldn't remember whether it was.
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:24.740]   I think that's right.
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.220]   It's a YouTube movies and shows.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:28.500]   So I guess if you're not a subscriber, you might have to pay for it.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:31.940]   And it's just an incredible collection tonight.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:32.940]   I can't wait.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:35.300]   Yeah, it's really good.
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:37.860]   And I will admit, I'm a fiend for this kind of that kind of movie.
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:39.380]   It's like 80% of what I watch.
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:40.380]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:41.380]   Yeah.
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:44.900]   And because that's what you're into, man, doing stuff.
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:45.900]   I like that.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:46.900]   Me.
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:48.360]   I just want to sit back and watch.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.140]   I like to watch Andy Enoco.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:54.080]   Your pick of the week.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:59.940]   Actually, mine is the 2021 app of the year, according to the app store.
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:09.540]   It's an interesting notes slash idea processor slash word processor called craft.
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:10.540]   Thank you very much.
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:12.480]   I accidentally tabbed out of the graph.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.480]   The website.
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:14.480]   Go to the website.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.020]   We did talk about this last week.
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:19.020]   So did you play with it after we talked about it last week or?
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:20.020]   Yes, I'm sorry.
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:21.020]   I totally forgot about that.
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.980]   Yeah, I start, I started playing with it last week.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:26.220]   And I just wanted to add some of my own notes to it.
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:32.100]   I thought, I thought that it's a nice hybrid between two different like project writing
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.500]   management kind of apps.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:36.900]   I like, I'm still using scrivener for like my work work work.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:41.300]   I've been using for like 10 years, whatever, because it's just a, it's just a powerhouse
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:46.340]   for organizing a book for starting up with notes and developing it, adding research, research,
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:47.340]   research.
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:52.500]   One of my, one of my scrivener docs is truly gigabytes in size because it incorporates
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.820]   PDFs and incorporates a million pictures and stuff like that.
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:58.020]   It's like a 10 year old research project.
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.260]   The other one that I, the other app that I tend to use is Ulysses for the opposite reason.
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:07.460]   It really is just a structured sort of like text editor where you can have like folders
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:13.460]   with text docs inside them, use that to sort of organize your thoughts and basically take
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:16.100]   down a big project chunk by chunk by chunk.
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:20.780]   It's not as powerful as scrivener, but unlike scrivener, it's a very, very simple file structure.
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:24.860]   So it's very, very easy to sync data across different devices.
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:30.020]   What I'm liking about, what I'm liking about craft is that it's, it incorporates some of
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:34.580]   the stuff I like about notion, which is that it kind of breaks free of the whole idea of
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:37.460]   docs as, as a fundamental construct.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:41.340]   You can just basically have a canvas that you're just basically dropping blocks onto.
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:42.860]   I think that's very useful.
[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:47.860]   It makes it very, very easy to share individual parts of your project with other people.
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:52.300]   If you, if other people need to see them, approve them, give, give their notes on it,
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:56.340]   without having to basically show them, export the entire document and see all the works that
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:59.100]   you've got on things you have, you barely even started.
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:05.500]   It's, it's, it's using its own, it's using its own cloud storage to make that happen.
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:09.540]   Scrivener gets a lot of flack for making it really difficult to sync between projects,
[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:13.660]   excuse me, sync between devices, because again, you, how do you sync three gigabytes worth
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:16.860]   of files and making sure that all of them have been chucked properly.
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:23.740]   So, and I'm not sure, I'm not sure it's quite for me, but it's definitely worth promoting.
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:27.460]   It's definitely worth telling people that this thing exists and please take a look at
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:28.460]   it.
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:32.780]   If, if you're finding yourself being falling short by Google Docs, Microsoft Office, or
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:36.780]   any, the, any of the apps that I've been, I've been mentioning, it's also kind of on,
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.340]   on the launch pad still, because they're still building stuff.
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:43.580]   They're building out something that I've really, really is attracting to me the ability to
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.980]   edit stuff via via web client, not just a Mac or iOS client.
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:51.300]   That's one of the, that's been one of the big things that's been missing from Scrivener
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:52.300]   for me.
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:55.340]   I stick with it despite the fact that I can't use it on my Chromebook or I can't use it
[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:57.500]   on random device that has a web browser.
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:01.300]   I would love if that had that feature, but it seems to take a lot of boxes that I would
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:04.980]   love to have seen like in Ulysses and Scrivener for that reason.
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:09.260]   Definitely with taking a look at also, there's a free tier, very, very useful for if you,
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:13.900]   if you're paying nothing for it for 45 bucks a year, you get like the more muscular version
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:16.300]   of this.
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.420]   Craft.do and it is beautiful.
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:22.780]   I played with a little bit and as I mentioned last week, the only reason I stopped using
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:26.260]   it is because it's not cross platform because I think it's fantastic.
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:28.060]   I really was impressed by it.
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:33.580]   But I don't live on Mac and Tasha's all the time.
[02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:36.900]   Actually more and more because of the Mac M1 Pro.
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:38.980]   I'm really, that's how they suck you in.
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:43.620]   They really, I have to say, I was, you know, all about my framework laptop until I got
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:49.740]   the new Mac Pro and it's like, wow, this thing is kind of fast, kind of fast.
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:51.060]   You're ecumenical.
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.060]   You embrace all faith.
[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:53.060]   I am.
[02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:54.060]   Yes.
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.060]   I like what's good.
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:57.620]   I also noticed that I'm very fattish.
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:02.620]   You know, I'll go through periods of really, you know, deep interest in this and then it
[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:06.300]   moves on and now it's that.
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:07.300]   That's just me.
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:09.300]   Hey guys, you know what?
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.180]   You did a good job and we're now done.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:13.340]   Mac Break Weekly is almost through.
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:20.020]   But first, a plug for Renee Richie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:22.220]   You just finished your myth busting episode.
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:26.620]   Are you going to take a nap and hold off before you.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:29.180]   No, I want to talk about the iPhone 14 camera.
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.300]   That's big news.
[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.940]   The iPhone 14 camera.
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:34.420]   Holy crap.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:35.580]   Big sensor pixel binning.
[02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:36.580]   It might be fun.
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:37.580]   Do we know though?
[02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:38.580]   I mean, this is rumor, right?
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:41.980]   It's rumors, but like it makes sense, especially if you want to get towards a K, you got to
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.420]   get more pixels in that camera.
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:47.820]   See now, the only reason I ask is I'm feeling guilty that I am bringing it up.
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:48.820]   Next week you'll.
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:51.340]   Yeah, you'll know all about it.
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:52.340]   You'll have lots to say.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:55.220]   You can watch the video in the meantime.
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:56.700]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:08:56.700 --> 02:09:00.420]   Andy Enocha, when are you on GBH in Boston next?
[02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:08.100]   On Friday as usual, 1230 in the afternoon, Eastern time, you can stream it live at WGBHNews.org
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:09.100]   or you can stream it later.
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:11.260]   They usually put them up later in the night.
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.260]   Nice.
[02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:14.340]   How's the project?
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:15.340]   You know what I mean?
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:16.340]   The project?
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.340]   How's that coming?
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:18.820]   It's moving forward.
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:22.220]   I'm still up to my personal deadlines on getting it done.
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:28.700]   My only bottleneck is as usual the design stuff, which is like I have to remind myself
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:31.100]   that just the content is what's important.
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:32.100]   It's not the masthead.
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:33.100]   It's not the site design.
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:36.180]   We're not trying to steer people to a store.
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:40.380]   We don't need to track their eye movements and figure out where they're clicking.
[02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:44.860]   Even if you just go over the basic WordPress template, that'll be fine, Andy.
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:46.660]   I look forward to it.
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:50.060]   Just know the world awaits.
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:55.220]   I will announce because I'm interested to see if any of this is a good idea.
[02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.020]   I've been working on this for several months.
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:02.260]   I still have an idea inside my head, but yeah, exactly.
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:05.060]   I wonder if this is a good idea.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:11.180]   Office Hours.global, the 24-hour global phenomenon, continues on.
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:13.620]   How's your studio coming along, Alex?
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:14.620]   It's coming well.
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:18.180]   One day as we talk about it, if you watch the Monday sessions, you'll see us talking through
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:19.180]   it.
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:20.180]   We made a bunch of decisions.
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:22.260]   What happens is I show everybody, "Okay, this is where I'm at."
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:24.100]   Then everyone goes, "Oh, I wouldn't do this."
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.980]   You have your thought about this.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:30.460]   What's funny is we started using Makerpipe is a thing that I've been using to kind of
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:33.820]   unplanning to build a bunch of this with.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:41.580]   The founder of Makerpipe, David Schlitter, was on our show last week.
[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:42.980]   This week he was on Monday.
[02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:45.660]   He's putting in questions like, "How are you going to connect this?"
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:48.380]   He's the person who owns Makerpipe is looking at this.
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:49.380]   Wow, funny.
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:52.020]   Of course, you're using Makerpipe to design this studio.
[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:53.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.500]   I'm building it with it.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:11:00.580]   Anyway, which I did before he came on or before I knew anything about them directly, we just
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:02.580]   started buying it.
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:09.700]   Anyway, we've decided, "Oh, we don't need shelves here and we have to think about this
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:10.700]   weight distribution.
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:12.580]   We're trying to build my new desk.
[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:15.420]   If it happens, you'll see us build it this coming Monday.
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:18.180]   We're not building it, but the design will come out more."
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:24.900]   It's a 514-toby desk that literally has wheels and will move around in the room so
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:25.900]   I can move it.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:29.300]   It's not just turning like you have a twit, but moving.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:35.260]   It's on wheels, but it's got 514 and a teleprompter and camera and all the lights are all in one
[02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:39.380]   thing that sits on wheels because what I want to be able to do is have my background be
[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.380]   different.
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:43.540]   I really want this kind of background or that kind of background.
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:48.460]   We even talked about putting it on one of those big turntables, so it's slowly turning.
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:55.940]   Over an hour, you just see different parts of the set, but we're going to not do that
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:56.940]   first.
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:57.940]   Anyway, but the…
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:59.940]   Oh, it's too easy to build.
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:00.940]   We're just going to be matching volumes.
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:03.540]   Can we just talk to each other and build volume sets for both of us?
[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.540]   Exactly.
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:05.540]   Exactly.
[02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:06.540]   It's so much fun.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:10.140]   If you're interested in sets, there's a lot of discussion about weight distribution and
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:14.700]   lights and routing and process because I've got one area that's my workbench area, one
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:20.740]   area that's my synthesizer area, one area that's the shelving and the fireplace.
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:24.420]   There's a whole bunch of things that are all in a little 15 by 20 foot cube that we're
[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:25.820]   figuring out together.
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:27.460]   That's on Mondays.
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:31.540]   Again, one of our best sessions.
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:36.100]   I think that some of our best sessions so far have been with Uleo and Andy and Renee
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:38.860]   are some of the best sessions we've had in our second hours and Michael Krasney was
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:40.620]   right up there with it last week.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:41.940]   So people should go up to…
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:44.940]   If you check out last Thursday and then we're streaming…
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:47.220]   I learned how to make pierogies on Sunday.
[02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:48.220]   I love pierogies.
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:51.060]   Yeah, it was pretty fun.
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:52.260]   All of these things are…
[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:56.340]   It's just a fascinating puzzle, but what you're going to see on Saturday that we run
[02:12:56.340 --> 02:13:03.300]   from 11 until like 4 o'clock in the afternoon is going to look a lot like a broadcast, but
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:04.300]   it's not.
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:05.300]   It's all over Zoom.
[02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:09.540]   And you're just going to see us piecing together all these technologies that are part of its
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:10.540]   being done in the web.
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:13.940]   I mean, part of its being done in the cloud, part of its controlling like literally remote
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:15.300]   controlling our switchers.
[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:20.340]   There's four switchers being controlled automatically from someone else, like someone
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:21.340]   in Germany actually.
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:25.980]   We'll be sitting there switching our switchers at home while we're doing the cooking.
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:30.060]   And then all of our signals are being cut in the cloud.
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:31.060]   And so…
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:34.820]   And you can actually, in office hours, listen to the comms and watch the behind the scenes.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:38.780]   You can either watch the show on YouTube, but you can also just listen to us and ask questions
[02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:40.660]   and talk about it while we're doing the show.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:44.340]   So it's a funny way to learn how to do this kind of stuff.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:45.540]   So anyway, that's coming up.
[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:46.540]   Office hours.
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:47.540]   Global.
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:52.140]   And if you want to employ Alex in your next stream, 090.media.
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:55.220]   We do a lot of crazy things.
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:13:59.940]   Mac break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1900 UTC.
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:03.340]   I mentioned in the live time because you can watch us do it live.
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:07.180]   I mean, I think most people listen on demand because it is a podcast.
[02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:12.180]   But if you'd like to be part of the live audience, just go to live.twit.tv.
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:17.100]   There's audio and video streams there and chat with us live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:21.260]   Club Twit members can also chat with us in our private discord, which is a great place
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:24.660]   to hang 24/7.
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.820]   Lots of fun going on in there.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:30.940]   You can also get the shows after the fact on the website, twit.tv.
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:32.980]   For this show is twit.tv/mvw.
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:34.420]   And all the shows are there.
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:39.900]   There's a YouTube channel for every show as well, including this show, youtube.com/macbreakweekly.
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:46.580]   Or go to youtube.com/twit for links to all of the show YouTube streams.
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:50.580]   And then finally, of course, the most common and best way to subscribe is use a podcast
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:54.140]   application where in every one of them just search for it.
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:56.820]   Subscribe and you'll get it automatically the minute it's available.
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:01.420]   If your podcast application supports reviews, please leave us a five star review.
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:02.980]   Let the world know.
[02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:11.340]   You listen to I think what is now the longest running Mac tech show anywhere Mac break weekly.
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:12.340]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:13.340]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:14.340]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:15.340]   Thank you all for listening now.
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:18.420]   Get back to work, cuz break time is over.
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:19.420]   Bye bye.
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:24.660]   Do you have an iPhone, an Apple watch, an iPad or any number of Apple devices?
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:29.900]   Well, you have got to check out iOS today with me, Michael Sargent and Rosemary Orchard.
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:33.860]   We cover all things iOS and help you get the most out of your devices.
