[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.440]   >> Hi everyone, welcome back to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.800]   This is Alex Lindsey, sitting in for Leo who is in Norway.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   Is it Finland?
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   Is it Norway?
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.480]   >> It's Norway.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.840]   >> It's Norway.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120]   >> I don't know where.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.600]   >> Hi.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.880]   >> Hey, well at least Sarah's here.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.480]   >> I am.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.280]   >> Yes, exactly.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   >> Yeah, Leo's gone this week.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.280]   And you were maybe going to be gone.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.920]   And so I thought, oh gosh, am I going to have to host MacBreak Weekly, the pressure.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.400]   And then Alex pulled through at the last minute and I went, cool, I can just be a helper.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.280]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.880]   >> And that we also here with course with Andy, Andy and I go, where are you Andy?
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.240]   >> I'm in an undisclosed location on my way to the land of ire.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.320]   >> Oh my goodness.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.880]   >> I've heard of Ireland like all my life, but only I'm preparing to do that.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.160]   We travel there like only a few days ago to realize, wait a minute, that means the land
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   of ire, they're not going to put up with a lot for me.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.800]   >> Well, it looks very secretive where you are.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.040]   It's covered up.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.240]   Anyway, so what will--
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.280]   >> Well, it's sort of starry and sunny at the same time.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.080]   >> Yes.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.600]   >> Exactly.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.280]   So I'm on the lookout tour.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.880]   >> I see a plug, an electrical plug.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.040]   He's somewhere in a civilized area.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.720]   >> Also coming from his neck of the woods, Don McAllister, hey Don.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.840]   >> Hello there.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.360]   I think it's Superman's ice cave.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   Until I saw that plug and then that probably blew it really.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   But it looks very sparkly where he is anyway.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.640]   But hello, hello, hello.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.240]   Thank you for inviting me back on.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.440]   >> It's great to have you, of course.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.320]   And we've got a lot of news, of course, it's Apple.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.480]   And we have earnings calls, which of course Apple has chosen to do right after the show,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.520]   because that's what they do.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.200]   You know, they don't want us to talk about the--
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.400]   it'd be really fun to do it like a live broadcast of the earnings calls.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.840]   Oh, wait.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.240]   >> Other than analysts are all over it.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.600]   Analysts love to try to guess what the earnings numbers will be before we actually hear.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.080]   >> Do you have a guess?
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.200]   >> The official earnings numbers.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.920]   A Piper Jeffery analyst, Gene Munster does.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.960]   >> What did he say?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.480]   >> He's projecting Apple to deliver 30 million to 33 million iPhone units in the March quarter.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.840]   Those estimates are based at least partly on Verizon's tally of 3.2 million iPhone activations.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.920]   Munster also says 33 million iPhone units do to growth in China and other countries.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.440]   >> So, Andy, does this matter at all?
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.920]   The question is, does it matter to Apple?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.840]   I mean, obviously the revenue matters to Apple, but all these analysts talking about it,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.400]   and which direction their stock goes, it kind of feels like they have to
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.440]   obviously deal with this.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.840]   But what kind of concern is it for them?
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.160]   >> I really think they're at that level right now, where as long as they can prove that the
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.320]   market for iOS devices is consistent and expanding, where it's not the case where
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.960]   their consumers are just looking for that one phone, that one holiday purchase,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.440]   as long as they can say the quarter after quarter after quarter, there is a consistent demand
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.160]   for every form of iOS device that we sell.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.760]   That's the only form of when that Apple's really focused on for the analyst call.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.920]   More money is always better than less money, but really what they really want to be able to say
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   is that we don't just have one hot phone that's replaced by another hot phone next quarter.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.240]   They want to say that there's consistent,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.360]   consistent, reliable demand for our strategy.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.720]   >> Don, do you think, I mean, obviously, from a US perspective, I think one of the things
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.560]   with that if the stocks started going down a lot, we would probably see more pressure for
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.880]   Apple to do dividends and so on and so forth.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.040]   Do you think that, but Apple tends to look very much at a long term trajectory.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   Do you think that they spend a lot of time worrying about these?
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> I don't think so. And again, I really get annoyed with the professional analysts because
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.520]   they're so far off the money sometimes. They really seem to be just making it up.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.960]   I think the independent analysts, the people who really focus in on the Apple ecosystem and
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.440]   understand Apple, I think they normally have better results than the professional analysts,
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.040]   to be honest. And again, I don't think Apple, it must be frustrating for them because they do
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   leave people down the wrong track sometimes with their forecasts, etc. But I don't think Apple
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.080]   are really that concerned. I don't think really it's about the stock price. Although they
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.000]   need to protect the stock price as best they can. But in some respects, it's pretty much out of their
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.480]   hands. >> Yeah, I mean, and we'll see how it turns out. I think that to me, the only thing
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.240]   would be more pressure for dividends is the stocks keep on going up. People like me just keep on
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.640]   saying, well, just enjoy the ride because you're getting your return. You're getting return every
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.240]   quarter because the stock keeps on going up. >> I think one of the interesting numbers will be
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.880]   max sales. Obviously, iPad sales are going to be strong. iPhone sales, I don't think that's going
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.920]   to be a surprise to anybody. If they beat expectations, and Apple always historically
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.360]   has conservative expectations on their side. But as far as max sales go, another analyst,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.920]   Shah Wu, who he works at Stern Edgy, says he's projecting 4.3 million max units, which is down
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.200]   from 4.7 million in the previous quarter. Some of that comes from an NPD report that
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.000]   max units fell 16% just last month. >> Right. But if iPad sales keep going up and max sales
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.360]   keep, it's not, I think Apple cares so much. >> I think as a host on Mac, a break, my only
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.280]   concern is not having my Mac, which I'm really attached to. >> Right. You're 17-inch.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.240]   >> In fact. >> Better hold on to that thing. I don't know if you can, you can upgrade it.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.040]   >> I have one too. >> I have five or six of them.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.560]   >> Do you? >> Well, the company has five or six of them. We use them.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.720]   >> They still have some uses. They're much faster. I actually don't need the form size.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   I just need the screen resolution and the power. >> The power.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:20.160]   >> And the power. >> Well, for editing, this is the way to go. I mean, that's why I had my 17-inch
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.200]   MacBook Pro belongs to Twit, but I convinced them to let me buy it because I said it'll be
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.320]   portable editing rig at the time I had a little bit of time to do editing. I don't so much these
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.520]   days, but it really made a big difference. But it's not really all that portable, especially when
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.840]   you've got something like the air. >> It is. It's just a good workout.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.080]   >> Yeah. >> I often, honestly, the 17-inch is more like a
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.480]   possible desktop. You take it somewhere, but then you actually leave it in your hotel room and go
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.880]   back to it and use your iPad or your MacBook Air as your portable device. So it's sort of like a
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.800]   desktop you can lift up and take away somewhere and plunk it down and then use it as a desktop
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.680]   machine in effect. >> And just in case you're wondering, you could fit two of those desktops
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.440]   in your backpack. >> You've got strong wrists. That's hard to do. You just held that thing up
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.040]   with one wrist. >> Oh, I have to carry those all the time. >> Right. You're used to it.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.360]   >> It's a long, it's not a long drawn out thing. >> Also, Alex has an underwear area that's very,
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.000]   very resistant to heat. Don't think they'll get that too. But the other thing, we're going to be
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.120]   really looking forward to the analyst call is that this is one of the rare occasions when the
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   senior executives get to respond interactively with any damn question that anybody wants to ask.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.040]   So the things that I'm really curious about are not about the 17-inch MacBooks, but to see what
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.280]   kind of answers they have when analysts ask them about things like the Kindle Fire and things like
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.440]   7-inch tablets off of Android. They, Tim Cook's comments, what's been the last call we're very
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.200]   telling because this was the first analyst call after the holiday season and people were asking
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.480]   directly, do you think that, did the sales of the Kindle Fire, a really, really highly successful
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.200]   Amazon product, did that affect sales of the iPad? And they were saying, no, we feel as though
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.840]   iPad sales are dinging MacBook sales a little bit, but we don't feel as though we felt any
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   pressure from the Kindle Fire, at least not this quarter. So this is the opportunity to hear a lot
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   of those tidbits with people have to think on their feet and they have to answer truthfully because
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.520]   this is a legal requirement that they're putting up with right now. >> Now, do you think that,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.720]   what do you think as we go into this, do you think that the Kindle Fire is making a large impact on
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.800]   the iPad or does it remain kind of in its own position, in its own market? >> I think it's in its
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.960]   own markets. Not only, and you have to really group it not only with the Kindle Fire, but also
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.520]   the touch Kindle. It really is a big deal to have a $100 book reader out there that pretty much is
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.120]   within reach of just by everybody. That's not something that Apple can furnish right now.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.320]   But I really think they're looking at that very, very carefully and they're choosing
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.840]   their timing very carefully about what I believe that they do have a plan for a way to sell a $299
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.720]   or even a $250 iPad, but they don't want to drop the hammer on that until they feel as though
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.480]   consumers have said very strongly, hey, look, we really, really want to have a smaller or less
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.520]   expensive iPad. >> Now, one of the things that we've seen, we have some other reports that are
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   just as interesting to some degree, as we switch away from the analyst calls, is the iPhone
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   accounted for half of the smartphone sales for Verizon, and is this true? 78% of the smartphone
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:21.600]   activations for AT&T. That has got to be both compelling for both of those companies and fairly
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.280]   frightening. >> When you think, I mean, it is, you know, because you walk into the AT&T store and
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.200]   you see, you know, there's 30 or 40 different options, or at least it feels like there's
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.080]   already four different options. What are you saying, Andy? >> That's a good point,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.040]   because a senior Verizon executive just last week made a really big bold point in his own,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.360]   like, it was an analyst call he was participating himself saying that they're investing very,
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.840]   very heavily released, really heavily promoting Windows phone. And the subtext there was that
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   we don't want to have our entire business to be controlled just by the iPhone. We want to make
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.680]   sure that we've got as many pennies and as many poutons as possible. >> Don, do you think this is
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.840]   a, do you think it's the same that we see and do you feel that in London as well? >> Yeah, we don't
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.240]   actually get figures, we don't get exposed to the figures of the nerve activations, etc. In fact,
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.960]   we don't really get a feel here in the UK for, you know, just how one vendor is doing against another.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   You know, it's fairly ubiquitous now. You know, iPhone's pretty much everywhere,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.480]   but I still think it boils down to the fact that, you know, people go looking for an iPhone,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.040]   or they go looking for another phone. And, you know, it's the other phone can be any of, say,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.000]   30 or 40 different types of Android phones. I'm not sure how the Windows phone is going to play
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.680]   into this, whether or not it will sort of get the traction that people think it might. But,
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.520]   you know, it's still an iPhone versus the rest of the world. And while people are still conscious
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.280]   of the iPhone, while they're still progressing the brand and they're still building new features
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.200]   into it. And don't forget, you know, I think it was, I read somewhere last month that the,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.120]   you know, the iPhone 3GS, you know, it's a three or four year old phone and people are still buying
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.800]   it. It's still one of the top phones for sale. >> Well, it's free. >> And, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.200]   >> Well, it's still relevant. It's still working. It's still upgradable. You know, when you,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   the new versions of iOS comes out, people can install it on the iPhone 3GS and they've got,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   you know, a brand new up to the minute phone with, you know, most of the features that the,
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.680]   the better models have with the hardware. >> Here's the question. Do we really think that the
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.960]   new Windows phone is really going to do well? I mean, we hear a lot about it. Everyone seems to
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:32.080]   be very excited about it. >> I think there's a lot of interest. I haven't had a chance to play around
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.080]   with one, you know, for very long rather than holding it here or there a couple of times. But
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.160]   the reviewers seem to love it. But the thing is, it's like it's not an iPhone competitor in my
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.760]   opinion. It has a lower price point. The materials are different. Obviously, the operating system is,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.120]   is extremely different and it's very unique. I think it's going to appeal to a lot of people,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.680]   but I don't see a lot of folks jumping ship from iOS. >> I don't get the interface. I look at it.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.400]   I'm like, I don't really understand this. Andy, have you played with one? >> Oh, man, much.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.480]   >> Oh, I've had one for weeks. I'm a huge, huge fan of the Windows phone operating system.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.600]   I've had the Lumia 800 and the 900. And one of the things, the reasons why I love it so much is that
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.400]   it's the only mobile phone operating system, the only smartphone operating system that doesn't try
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.080]   to ape the iPhone in any way. Microsoft really did go there in their own directions. So, the idea is
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   not to try to knock iPhone off in this perch and you really can't do that. The idea is to appeal to
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.760]   people that are kind of, eh, I guess, iPhones, nice, I guess, but I wish it weren't so complicated,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.520]   or I wish I didn't have to keep drilling down into apps in order to get that what I want.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.200]   I wish that what I really was interested in was surf as like the minute that I take this phone out
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.280]   of my pocket. So, for that reason, I think they've really, really staked out a really interesting
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.760]   bit of turf for themselves. The other thing about it is that it's going to make a whole lot
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.040]   more sense to a whole lot more people once Windows 8 comes out. And when you see that level of
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.520]   interact, when it has a tight level of interaction with Windows that works as tightly as the iPhone
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.640]   works with Mac OS, then we're going to see a lot of people who they got their free upgrade to Windows
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.240]   8 as they, excuse me, they got, they upgraded their machines to Windows 8 or they bought a new
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.160]   machine that has Windows 8. They go into the store because their contract on their old Android
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.400]   phone is up. They say, "Wait a minute, this looks exactly like what I've got going on Windows 8
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.280]   on my desktop. How does these, how do these, how well does this phone work with my desktop operating
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.200]   system?" And if this Windows phone will work much, much better with their notebook,
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.440]   then an iPhone will work with their Windows notebook. That is kind of like the thin end of the wedge
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.840]   that the Microsoft can really exploit. But the bottom line is that they don't have to beat the
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.600]   iPhone. All they have to do is create a market that Microsoft doesn't have right now, which is a
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.320]   market for handsets. Well, and I have to admit, the iPhone does not. The iPhone iPod, I mean,
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.720]   they do work with PCs and they don't work very well. I mean, you know, my payroll is out.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.400]   They don't want you to think that they work really well. You can run your iPhone with a Windows
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.480]   machine if you must until you can afford to buy a Macintosh. Well, the Halo, I think that's part of
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.880]   the Halo of you buy an iPhone and then it doesn't really, it's not really smooth. And then it finally
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.920]   you just break down by a Mac so that your iPhone will work better. But you have to give it to
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.680]   Microsoft for building something that it does not look like iOS and it doesn't look like Android
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.640]   either. I mean, I consider Android and iOS. I know that they're two completely different
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.680]   philosophies and ways of doing thing. But in general, I feel like the phones all look the same.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:28.080]   In general, you know, the Windows phone not so much. Yeah, it's interesting timing as well for when,
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.680]   you know, it's going to take Microsoft a couple of months to actually get Windows phone out there
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.840]   in the marketing, kick in, etc. And then Windows 8 comes out. But of course, over the next couple
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.680]   of months, I mean, we're looking at hopefully June issue for WWDC and one would expect and one
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:48.480]   would anticipate a WWDC that, you know, the new features of iOS 6 will be announced. And I don't
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   know whether or not we'll see a new phone at that event probably in the in the autumn or the fall.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.760]   But you know, then the games changed again because, you know, Apple have had a year to work on the
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.440]   new version of iOS. There'll be new hardware coming out for the iPhone. We've got mountain
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.680]   line coming out. We don't know yet what integration there will be between the Mac, the new Mac that
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.240]   come out this year as well with the new processors and mountain line in iOS 6. So again, you know,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.960]   it's this, it's this sort of snowball. In fact, this leapfrogging effect that Apple always work
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.880]   to their best advantage really of sort of keeping ahead of the curve and bringing this new technology
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.560]   out just as other people are coming on stream with technology. They've been working on Apple
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.200]   has this tendency to leapfrog them. And that will be interesting to see what they're up against.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.360]   Now the worldwide developers are not going to announce, right? We're still waiting on it. Yeah,
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.760]   it's that there are there is a rumoured date, which is in the middle of June. And we always know
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.680]   what the dates are because because they have to they have to set up. So if you go to the Musco
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.880]   and you have to reserve the space. Apple has reserved these windows. Yeah, you go.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.320]   It's a corporate event, it says, but it gives you know the clues, but it's normally the Apple
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.280]   event. And now we're still still waiting to hear for the announcement really. And of course,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.480]   all the developers on tent hooks because it sold out within about eight hours last year.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.080]   Yeah, it's just it's incredible that you know, the that and it's expensive. This isn't like a
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.160]   cheap little conference, right? This is like $1,500 or something like that to go. And and
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.200]   an Apple and you wonder, I always wonder if Apple could just make it a little bit bigger.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.960]   But I guess that they, you know, if it sells out that fast, you could double it and sell it out in
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.520]   18. Yeah, one of the issues though is is access to the to the Apple staff because they have about
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.680]   1000 engineers on site. And right for the main benefit for most of the developers who go up to
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.280]   there's lots of networking and meeting of the developers, etc. And the sessions themselves,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.920]   although they're very quick in getting the sessions out now, I think they had the sessions
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.960]   out in about two or three weeks last year. So the sessions aren't really the critical point.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.240]   For a lot of people, it's the one to one with the Apple engineers, you can put workshops and
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.520]   and interviews with Apple engineers to focus in on specific elements of your own particular
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.560]   application. And you don't hear much about it because we're not allowed to talk about it when
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.480]   it's actually going on. It's all. Yeah, other than the main event, other than the main keynote,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.760]   that's right. Yeah, so the so anyway, so we'll see in development of the of the iPhone,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   there's a, you know, we got a Chinese website. You know, what would we where would we be
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.360]   without Chinese websites? I mean, you know, I mean, without their products, we would be very dark.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.640]   It wouldn't be a lot of technology, but without technology websites, we wouldn't know what was
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.640]   coming next and or have some idea or at least be able to talk about it on the show. And so we have
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.400]   a square button. This is this is the new. How does Apple do this? They get get us to talk about
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.280]   the square button. Andy, do you think that the button is going to be the home button is going to
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.560]   become square? Oh, well, it's it's interesting. I mean, they could have just built this just for
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.960]   for some ideas or kicking around. It could they you don't see the back of the of the button. So
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.400]   maybe there's even some something such some new touch sensitivity in the back of it. But I've
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   started to redefine China as Narnia because it's this magical land where centaurs fight with golden
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.920]   daggers and mystical parts happen come from out of nowhere that may or may not have anything to do
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.960]   with anything that we're going to see in the next three years. So it's I don't I don't I don't feel
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.480]   as though we can really talk about that the idea of squaring off the button is a really, really big
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.440]   deal. You know, when I first read this article, I had to actually pull up my phone and look at it
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.480]   because I thought, wait, it isn't already a square. Well, like, you know, because it's but the thing
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.200]   is when you when you think about it, okay, let me unlock my phone. When you think about it,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.560]   you've got a perfectly round button kind of hard to see because I've got the white
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.280]   iPhone, but inside the button, you've got the the little square, it's sort of just a gray outline.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.240]   But it makes perfect sense to make the button the same size and shape as the apps themselves.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.040]   That's exactly what that would mean. It does make sense. And that just makes sense.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.280]   I don't think I don't think this is very far.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.960]   In fact, now that I've seen this picture, I'm actually fairly angry with Apple.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.360]   Why? I think that the industrial design has failed us.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.880]   It should have been square from the beginning. When it went to the before,
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.680]   when they moved to the kind of squarish look, that's when they should have made the change.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.040]   Yeah, I mean, it's, it's well, maybe they figured that the home button, you know, there's only so
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.600]   much outrage people can take when you change anything at all. So yeah, there's some, some,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.040]   it doesn't fit in with the current speculation about what Apple might do with the size of the
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.160]   screen though, does it? Because I know with rumors are rampant that to get a bigger screen on the
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.840]   iPhone, they don't need to change the physical body size. They just need to elongate the screen.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.040]   And that would probably necessitate a knob long button, a knob long home button or a rectangular
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.400]   home button rather than a square or a round one. So it doesn't quite fit in with those particular
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.080]   rumors. I got to say that responding to a rumor several months before the fact, I acknowledge all
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:34.240]   of that. But I would be really disappointed in Apple if they totally changed the aspect ratio
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.600]   of the screen, created a whole new, what you would think would have to be a whole new class
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   category of iPhone apps just because they don't want to make the handset wider. Given even given
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.280]   that there are just millions and millions and millions of these slightly larger phones that
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.760]   everybody seems to use and everybody seems to love, that would be Apple would really have to
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.880]   convince me that they're not, that they're not just being contrary. And we're in adding this extra
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.600]   row of vertical pixels instead of just simply making the iPhone a little bit wider.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.840]   Yeah, I think it is due for a form factor change, probably a bit more significant,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.200]   just the screen size. Although it wouldn't surprise me if we did just see the screen
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.680]   elongate because it is a fairly elegant solution to what could be quite a funny problem for them,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.720]   other than to completely redesign the iPhone 5 or whatever it's going to be, the new iPhone
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.160]   to have a completely different form factor. But we've had the four with 4S. So now the next one
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.640]   might actually be right for a brand. It better look different. I mean, I don't want a whole
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.760]   different phone that's built from the ground up necessarily. I think they should make it triangular.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:44.720]   That would be the sturdiest. That's for sure.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.880]   You could hold a bunch of them together and build a bridge.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.000]   So if you got frustrated, you could throw it away, would boom around all the way back to you with
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.840]   that shape. Right. There's the rumors of using liquid metal on the back of it rather than glass,
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.080]   which should make it. I do believe the back might be due for change because I think the reason why
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.760]   they went with glass for the back was simply because they were just sick and tired of seeing
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.640]   all those scratches on the plastic back of the device. I think that's the sole reason why they
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:19.920]   went with glass for the back of it. I think it's been two years since we've seen that glass back
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.320]   design. I think we got a lot of data where that's kind of a fault point. If you drop it,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.200]   that's probably going to go. I do think that the iPhone 4 is a little bit more fragile than
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.280]   complimentary Android phones that I've tried. So I wouldn't be surprised if they look for something
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.520]   that's a little bit more shatterproof, but still will allow them to make an iPhone that looks
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   absolutely handsome at the end of the contract just as good as it looked at the beginning of the contract.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.160]   The most important thing is that by putting metal in the back, it reduces the shatter
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.560]   possibility by 50%. Yeah. I guess liquid metal, which Apple has already been experimenting with.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:59.360]   I guess the little SIM ejector, that tiny little paperclip kind of guy, was made out of liquid
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:05.440]   metal in some of North American iPad models, not all of them. Just to see how it's like how
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.400]   it's like how it's like, can we manufacture this? To see, anyone noticed, I guess, but that
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.040]   it's lighter, much more dent and scratch resistant. So those things, of course, on a very delicate
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.000]   phone, especially when they do get dropped and they do every once in a while, if they can withstand
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.960]   like a three foot drop and not look like garbage on the other side, that's good to start. Yeah,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.640]   absolutely. But there was a report that was interesting because it reminded me, I've only
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.280]   ever had my hands on one liquid metal product ever. And it looked really cool. It was very,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.080]   very light, very, very strong. But this report reminded me of one characteristic of it. It bounced
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:47.200]   really, really bad, meaning that it doesn't really absorb the impact when you drop and just goes
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.840]   and makes the device go dead. It will actually bounce a couple of times off the table. It's not
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:00.080]   flubber. I wish I could cite the source for this because it was an interesting point.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.480]   Liquid metal would be a good thing for prevent scratches. It would be a bad thing,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.000]   though, if it causes it to take that one extra hop when you drop your phone,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.800]   that causes it to land screen down on something hard. I'm surprised at how often I drop my iPhone
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.840]   and how the fact that it's not cracked it. Because I do it very often. Yeah. Like, I mean,
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.040]   when I say often, I mean, like, I can't count anymore how many times it's falling. I put it in
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.600]   my pocket like this and I lean over it. And then you lean. Yeah. I had to stop putting my phone in
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:33.520]   my back pocket because it can also fall out onto hard things or a toilet, which is a wet thing.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.920]   I'm going to move on. Bad stuff. So the the in the courts coming up next Apple is we're going to
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:47.280]   we're going to hear about the iPad trademark and possibly 4G is it legit. But first Leo's Leo's
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.240]   going to talk to us a little bit about go to meeting back with more Mac break weekly. And just a bit,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.080]   I am time traveling here from beautiful Norway to tell you about go to meeting that's how much I
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.160]   care go to meeting.com. It's the best online meeting software anywhere. You've heard me talk

[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.120]   them so much for supporting Macbreak Weekly. Now back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.840]   Well, that was nice. It was like he was here with us for a second. Just for a second. Yeah.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.880]   Not even here over there. Right. Over in his office. That way. Well, what a lot of people don't
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.480]   know is that the only time traveling office in the studio is Leo's office. Totally. I really asked
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   for one. I was really campaigning for one. He was talking about getting one over here.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.640]   But he kept it. Well, it's the only way to make sense of how Leo does so much.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.080]   Exactly. Sometimes he has to close all the curtains so people don't realize how often
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.600]   he's coming and going. I mean, it's just one of those things. We see his car out here. It's
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.280]   been sitting there for a long time. And it really is just because he's been actually
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.720]   jumping centuries while we're here. That's how he keeps up with all of this.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.400]   Now you know. That's how you know. I usually don't get to tell these secrets,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.200]   but Leo's not here. He's not here. He's not here. He's not here. He's not going to even
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.000]   see the show. Stick around. It gets worse. You may be worse. You know, the worst part is he's
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.040]   probably already watched the show. And I'm probably going to get a critique like now. You know,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.760]   like, you know, the thing you said in 20 minutes, don't say that. I'm going to say that.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.840]   He could materialize it any time and change the course of history. Exactly. That would just
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:57.520]   turn the whole thing. So anyway, we're back to Mac news rather than Leo news. And the Pro View
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.080]   owns according to a government official in China. This is according to the state administration for
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.600]   a senior official from the state administration for industry and commerce.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.960]   They said that Pro View owns the, they think that the Pro View owns the iPad trademark.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.760]   And so this, I thought this was just going to go away. Yeah. I mean, I thought I thought we were
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.840]   going to. I was hoping. I was like, really? Oh, and so, but evidently the lawyers are still now.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:30.000]   Now the, of course, Pro View's lawyers told Reuters on Monday that the firm is negotiating with Apple
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.520]   and would like to, of course, have an out of court settlement. What is the Chinese word for
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.240]   extortion? I just wanted to know. Andy, do you think this is actually going to go anywhere?
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:45.600]   I have no idea. I'm hopefully too smart to talk about the law in the United States of America.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.920]   When you go overseas to a communist government that's trying to,
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.480]   trying to build an economy anyway they possibly can with lots of people who see money on the
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.320]   ground and we picked up goodness. I, I doubly don't know what I'm talking about. But doesn't
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.240]   this seem like, I mean, this seems, especially now that the Chinese government or someone from
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.920]   one of the administration starts to step into this, shouldn't this be seen as a very scary
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.240]   precedent from a company from a country that does an awful lot of exports with the United States to
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.280]   have them afraid that this isn't really going to turn out. So that I really want to, I'm really
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.960]   curious to see how this plays out because I, this is kind of like a game of chicken where this company
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.440]   can sort of push it and push it and push it. I think until they get to the point where Apple has
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.160]   to start to talk to people kind of more senior than the judges who are ruling in this company's
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.920]   favor and say, yeah, here's how much money we're pumping into your economy. Here's how much prestige
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.000]   we're putting into your ability to manufacture by allowing you to manufacture our products.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.760]   Is there something you could do to the break lines of one of these cars, of one of these corporate
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.720]   people to make this go away or just just say, here, here, we have a deal for you. You stop pirating
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.800]   our software and then we can start having these conversations about about your trademarks.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:08.960]   All right. I mean, the pro view and the lawyers working for ProView have been very vocal about
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.440]   the fact that they just want to settle. They want to settlement. They'd love for this to stay out of
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.400]   the courts. And Apple just isn't really playing along so far. Obviously, they're having conversations
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.080]   behind the scenes, but Apple hasn't said, sure, we'll pony up this amount of money just to make
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:28.000]   you go away. And then a senior official with the state administration for industry and commerce
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.720]   saying, hey, listen, as far as I can see, ProView's got that iPad trademark does not mean that that's
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:40.400]   the way a judge will rule. It is possibly indicative. Well, I think in China, I think it's a little
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.040]   bit more top down though. So I think it's a little less predictable here. Don, do you think Apple's
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.080]   going to sort this out? Yeah, I mean, they have so much influence over there, I would imagine,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.480]   you know, with the manufacturing cloud that they've gotten and the prestige of the brand as well.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.080]   I mean, going back to the earnings call, it's something that always fascinates me is just to
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.160]   see how well they're doing internationally in your China's a big market for Apple. So, you know,
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.720]   I would imagine there's a few, not so much favors they can call them, but I'm sure there's some
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   pressure they can bring to bear on sort of getting coming to an ami-kaloo agreement.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.200]   That, you know, they've got plenty of cash. They could, by the way, as of it, if they wanted to,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.320]   but you know, they might want to not set precedence and use other techniques to get
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.920]   around this particular thorny problem for them. Well, and it seems like it's not so much even
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.040]   Apple's influence. It seems like the electronics industry, the businesses that are pumping all
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.760]   this money into the Chinese economy by building stuff there, feeling like you're not safe.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.120]   You know, this is a big complaint that they have generally that their stuff goes in and
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.960]   their technologies are stolen and their movies are copied and, you know, everything else is
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.000]   already happening. This is just another, you know, upset for them that now that they can't trust
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.920]   the copyright laws, that obviously Apple did a fair amount of due diligence before they
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.680]   launched the iPad to make sure that they had all these trademarks sorted out. So, the idea that
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.520]   things can change that quickly in China, just if I was an electronics company in general, it would
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.640]   create a concern, I guess. Well, as far as I am, I'm sure you guys have talked about this on
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.360]   Macbreak Weekly in the past, but it's a little muddy how that name was signed off on. Well,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.320]   it's going to be well, it was, it was, it was one way of our, you know, our whole branch.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.400]   And they made a deal with a company that Apple had cloaked as an individual company,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.400]   but it was really just Apple and nobody would have signed it. Have we known what was going on?
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.240]   Well, that's, but that's how all these companies do that.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.120]   Right. When you do a trademark, when you, when you protect it, when you're going to go out and do
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.880]   a trademark and you want to keep it secret and you don't want to pay a hundred times more,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.600]   you're going to put out a bunch of shell companies. Because if Apple, they would have asked for
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.560]   many, many, many more dollars. Exactly. So, yeah, especially if you, if you find out you're the last
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:53.440]   one. So, so anyway, so we'll see how that goes. Also, Apple is claiming that it's 4G labeling is
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.200]   legit in Australia. So of course, this was the whole issue about, you know, we put out an iPad
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:05.280]   that says 4G ready, which it is in the United States, but not necessarily in, you know, down under.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:12.720]   Yeah. Well, okay. So the way that I feel about this is I guess as a consumer, if I felt duped
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:19.520]   into buying an iPad that was supposed to have 4G speeds that were above and beyond anything else
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:25.200]   I could get in Australia, that would suck. But it's like, you know, the iPad can't just magically
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:32.080]   make the pipe bigger. Right. So it's constrained by what is offered in your country. Right.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:39.200]   It seems to me on the packaging, on the website, that Apple was fairly clear that, hey, we're calling
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:46.000]   it the 4G because 4G is sort of this generic term for faster speeds, right? But 4G means a lot of
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.680]   different things. None of the only two that this is, and I believe this is according to the
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.440]   Washington Post, but the only two that are that are truly 4G are the LTE advanced and YMAX released
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.520]   to, which aren't widely deployed. I don't think they deployed anywhere. I mean, I don't think you
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.400]   can get true because true 4G is 100 megabits a second. But nobody's doing this. So we have to
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.480]   realize that all of this is made up. That's the problem. It's like, you can say, well, I don't get
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.600]   that kind of 4G. It's like, all right, why do we keep saying 4G? Well, just because the next,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   it's the next bump up from 3G really. I think it's easier for people to understand
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.880]   than HSPA+ and YMAX and what? I don't know what any of this is. Let's call it 4G because that
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:34.480]   sounds modern. But it's confusing outside of the US. It wasn't really pushed as this magical new
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.120]   networking speed. It was mentioned that it's available in the US, but that was it. And Sarah
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.600]   says it hasn't really been heavily promoted over here. It just says it's compatible with fast networks.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.680]   Because it's not available, right? You don't have 4G in the UK, right? I think there's a pilot in
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.480]   London. I think there's a pilot in London. But again, I wouldn't know which variant or which
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:56.000]   flavor it is, but I know there's a pilot. One of the service providers doing a pilot in London.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.400]   But the iPad was never touted as being anything other than what we already knew what it would be.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.560]   So from my point of view, it was really an on issue. And I think the Australians seem to have
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.560]   taken an umbrage with it in a lot more depth than other countries. I mean, I've not really
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.560]   heard anything in the UK about people being upset about it or it being. And don't forget,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.680]   we have actually brought Apple to task many a time on the promotional material. And I don't think
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:28.960]   they haven't raised any issues with this time around. Now Apple has offered, of course, to
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.240]   refund, you know, to offer refunds to Australian customers. It felt like they were misled. But
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.200]   then, of course, they would have to give them back. Yes. So I would love to see the figures,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:46.000]   to see how many refunds and returns they'd had. I probably counted it on the things of one hand,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.680]   to be honest. Yeah, I think the people that want to complain about the fact that it's not 4G.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.760]   Are they really going to take the iPad three back? It'd be a great deal move, though. Andy,
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.480]   what do you see? Do you see hundreds or tens or thousands going back to Apple?
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:05.600]   Yeah, this is just like that, that really big moment that you have with your boss saying that
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.680]   it's absolutely horrible that I'm, I have to work again. It's for half an afternoon on
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.840]   Saturday. We'll not stand for this. Well, we don't want you to compromise your principles. If
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.360]   you have to quit, well, we'll sorry, we're sorry, but we will understand that you have to take this
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.920]   stand. Oh, wait, okay, it's okay. I just, I really just wanted to get next. I really want to just get
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.400]   an hour on lunch break for Saturday instead of a half an hour. You wonder, you wonder really
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   why they went to all this, to all this hullabaloo, just for a high speed network that would never
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.800]   have been available in that country anywhere. I think it's more interesting at the controversy
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:43.360]   about, you know, AT&T suddenly, suddenly upgrading every single iPhone 4S to a 4G model,
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.960]   with a, with a, with a new version of the OS. That too is another one of those things that's,
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.440]   the, the governing body as such, such as it is that regulates that standard, such as it does.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.560]   So.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.000]   Oh, no.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.920]   Oh, I'm doing so well.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:10.080]   Okay. There is, can be called 4G. We're going to let you do that, but realize the next time you do
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.680]   it, like you're going to be yellow card, it's serve. Yellow card and a red card it is it, is it,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.400]   I think they already got the yellow card. I think that's the, anyways, so a lot of soccer there. So,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.880]   see, I'm just trying to prove that I actually know something about soccer. I still don't, I just
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.440]   want to say, I go, I go after my knowledge with yellow card. I know it becomes, I know, I know
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:37.120]   the yellow card for the red card, but that's it. Yeah. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I still don't understand,
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.640]   offense, the off, you know, getting off sides. I don't understand.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.240]   Oh, yeah. We were really talking about.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.120]   I'm just going to move on. I'm just going to move on because I can't, I don't want,
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.560]   I don't want to get into a conversation about off sides.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.720]   So it's sort of like in perfect world, Australian government says, this is deceptive marketing.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.760]   So, so what happens, right? So let's say Apple has to,
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.680]   I think Apple, Apple, what happened, you know, they just dropped the word for G.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.240]   Really fast.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.720]   I think I would just change it to really fast.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.120]   Just just, and I would just do it RF. Really fast.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.640]   People might make that make a mistake of radio frequency, but I would just say RF,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.240]   right, RF really fast.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.200]   So they actually called it the iPad 4G or anything.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.080]   There was, it's just, it's just in the marketing material that it does mention its
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.920]   compatibility with 4G networks. But I don't know, again, on the Australian site,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.200]   where they're actually mentions that.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.880]   I do think in the bottom of the ad, they could say, when you visit the United States,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.480]   it will be really fast or.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.320]   Yeah. In fact, it's funny that this is, we're having this conversation
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:39.920]   because Apple, more than ever, doesn't even want anything associated with the word iPad.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.520]   It's the new iPad.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.920]   That's what it is. Now, talk amongst yourselves about which models you have.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.960]   We believe that up to you.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   But it's new iPad. That's what we're calling it.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.400]   So now, now moving from the iPad back to the Mac.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.000]   So we're going to put that, put the iPad backwards. This is Mac break.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.480]   We're working very hard to talk about Macs every once in a while.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.200]   It looks like MacBook Pros could go all quad core with the first wave of
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.880]   Ivy Bridge processors. So hopefully, we might see these sometime soon.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.960]   And they could be quad core, which means that they'd be blazing fast.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.200]   Don, do you think you see yourself needing a new Mac Pro?
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:23.040]   Yeah, possibly. I've been using, quite recently, I've been using the Mac Pro as my main production
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.400]   machine really for my editing.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.680]   Mac Pro or Mac Pro?
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.800]   Sorry. No, Mac Pro. I've been using the Mac Pro.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.720]   And about two months ago now, I said, right, I'll still keep a Mac Pro.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.040]   We're actually going to use my MacBook Air as my main production machine.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.840]   So I've actually been sort of using my MacBook Air as my main machine for my editing and stuff.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.880]   And it's been working great. I got a Thunderbolt display and I got a Thunderbolt drive for storage.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.640]   And I've been really happy with it. It could do with just a little, such more power.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   So if they did bring out quad core MacBook Pros, but in a new styling,
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.920]   in a MacBook Air style, that would be very tempting to have to say.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.000]   I would seriously consider grading to a MacBook Pro.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.720]   But one of these nice new thin droppies, not these great big bulky old-fashioned things
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.760]   that people have. I find that the biggest thing that makes a difference with performance
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:16.640]   is actually the hard drive. So I got a, we have raids built into most of our Mac Pros.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.080]   So we just take the three slots, the extra slots, and we just put cheap 7200 RPM drives in there,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.800]   and then raid zero of them. And we call them scary raids to remind us that,
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   it's scary because you'll lose anything on there if it goes bad. But they run about 300
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.000]   Megs a second. And what's crazy is my SSD drives that sits inside of this runs 200
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.600]   Megs a second. That sits inside of my 17 inch. And if someone's thinking about how fast their
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.040]   computer has to be, I think the first thing you want to think about investing into is SSD.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.200]   Because I, you know, all these, you talk about all these processors. I haven't seen
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.760]   significant processor changes that have really affected me as much as that.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.400]   Well, so that was going to be my question for you. We hear quad-core processors coming down the line.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.880]   You did mention that you like your 17 inch MacBook Pro, partly because of the screen real estate,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:08.720]   but partly because it's just a beefed up system. But that doesn't sound like it would be sufficient
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   just to have the quad-core processor. Yeah, no, I will. Because you need the space.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.760]   I, I, I have to admit that I, when I get these, I feel like, you know, time is usually of the
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   essence when we buy these. And so, yeah, so they're, they're the fastest processors,
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.360]   you know, the largest SSD drives, the, you know, like everything that we, that we can make it work,
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.440]   because we're usually sitting on, on a set somewhere. And we have to turn over a one-hour event,
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.040]   you know, to YouTube or whatever as fast as we possibly can. And so that's the,
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.280]   that's kind of our, our stress point. And we have learned that the other problem you get into,
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.440]   when you start speeding up the processors and you start speeding up the, the drives is that,
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:47.680]   that you can actually thump the computer in a compressor, just in case you're wondering.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.880]   If you, if you, if you get really good at using the, the distributed rendering,
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.960]   you'll, you, you, I have these little, I don't know if you guys have i-stat menu. Do you guys,
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.840]   do you use i-stat menu? I-stat menu. Yeah, I do. Here's a early pick. I, you,
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.480]   I don't know how anyone lives without i-stat menu. Just, just saying. So do you, you live with it.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:11.680]   I'm living and breathing, but maybe my life is like a trap your version of what it should be.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.960]   I'm about to, this is, this is a little, a Mac based rat hole. Just thought I'd let you,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.120]   let you guys know, but you can't, you have to put this on. So it's 14 days for free. Just try it
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.800]   and once you put it on, you'll never take it off again. So what it does, it gives you all
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.400]   those performance backgrounds. You can always look and see, I can see what my, my network
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.480]   performances, so my upload and download speeds. Yeah, I know that's great. And all my processors.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.080]   And what's really great is when you get this, you always know that you've set up a compressor.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:43.520]   Oh, sorry. Um, ah, hold on. Oh, I, I just wondered if this was the right screenshot. Yeah, that's
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.080]   what I've got. That's it. Yeah. And, but I'll show you, hold on. Let me, it's at $16, but you've
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.480]   got a, uh, $16 trial period. Yeah. And you can do a trial period to decide, decide whether I'm
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:58.240]   crazy or not. But, um, it looks like they have Mac versions, iPad and iPhone versions. I haven't
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.960]   used the other ones. I think they have other apps. I think Bajango has other apps. But, um, if you
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.440]   look at, if you look at my screen, um, you'll see this. Can you see my, the top of my screen
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:13.120]   in the capture, Eileen? Yeah, she should. I will, uh, try. Hold on.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.520]   The, the, my problem is, is like now there's so much going on at the top of the screen and I'm
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.920]   distracted. You know, but it's very important because you know that, you know, the, the thing
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.400]   is, is a, you can see all of my, uh, you know, I can see what my, my network speeds are. Yeah.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.360]   I can see what my processor usage is. I can also see what's using my processor because a lot of
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.040]   times Firefox with Flash will just start, you suddenly hear the fans turn on and try to figure
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.360]   out what's causing it. And you can just turn on the CPU and go, Oh, Firefox is using up 400%
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:47.840]   300% of my, whatever. And so I can turn it off. And, um, uh, anyway, so, uh,
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.000]   I think I'm getting the back of the TV. Okay. There you go. That's not going to work. That's
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.960]   not going to work. So anyway, there's no better feeling though, is there, Alex, when you, you're
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.120]   encoding something, can you, you, you switch over to ask that menu and you see all four cores or all
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.680]   like cores pumping away a full max and you knew then that you've done the right thing. You know,
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.200]   you know that everything is fully operational. But, but the one thing that we learned is that if we,
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   if we did it too, if we added too many virtual, um, you know, servers or whatever to it,
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.800]   uh, it'll speed up and then, and then you'll get a little gray screen that, you know,
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.360]   the many languages, uh, the Mac doesn't quite know what to do with that much speed. So anyway,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.720]   anyway, so, but, uh, those are, you know, I don't know why we started talking about that.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.280]   We started talking about it because we were talking about, um,
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:34.080]   the idea of a quad core processor versus the other thing machines are using now.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.840]   The only thing with the quad core is heat is, well, especially in the laptop. You know, I hope they,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.480]   they have the correct thermal management to, to keep heat down. But of course, if they do bring
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.640]   out a new range, you know, again, room with a rumor rumor, but you know, whether or not we'll see,
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.120]   uh, a retina display on the new laptops at the next rev when they do bring out these new processes
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.200]   or whether or not that's too early. Um, I would like to see a retina display. I have to admit,
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.800]   when the, when the iPad three came out or whatever they call it, the new iPad came out, it literally
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.520]   hurt my eyes for like the first half an hour. Did it hurt your eyes? No, it did not. Why did it hurt
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   my eyes? It was so sharp. It hurt my eyes. And now, now everything looks like it's out of focus.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.280]   Like it was like, you felt like you had the wrong prescription glasses. I know. I was like,
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.040]   what is wrong? And now, and now I look at everything. It's all like glasses.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.480]   Well, I've actually gone to get new prescription glasses because I felt I wasn't getting the
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   full benefit from it because it was, it was so sharp. And then when I went to the iPad two,
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.240]   I thought, my goodness, it's broken. But then, oh, no, that was what I know.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:34.800]   When I, when I got my hands on the new iPad for the first time, I said, I mean, I guess I can see
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.840]   that it's a little nicer, but I don't know. It kind of looks the same until I went back to second
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:46.240]   gen and it's like, underwater, see anything, the pixel. How does anyone use this? You know,
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.080]   how does anyone use the thing I've been using for the last two years? Yeah, it's easy to get used
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:56.080]   to retina display for sure. So Andy, do you think that, do you think that the new processors are
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:02.480]   coming out this spring? Yeah, definitely. I think that not only is it just a good thing to always
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:08.400]   make sure that the MacBooks have parity with the speed and power windows machines that cost $400
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.640]   less. I think that they need to make sure that there's always a distinction between the MacBook
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.920]   Pro line and the MacBook Air line. There has to be for extra $250, there has to be a really
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:22.000]   emphatic statement that if you really, if you don't care about having something that's super,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.880]   super thin and super, super light, and you can forego another three or four hours for the battery
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.520]   life, here is something where you really can use this as your desktop machine and live your entire
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.400]   world off of this one machine. I don't think the MacBook Air is quite there yet. It really is
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:42.640]   kind of a throwback to the original PowerBooks where you have your real Macintosh, your iMac,
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:50.160]   or your Mac Pro, excuse me, your G4 Mac on the desktop, but then you could sort of make a smaller
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.880]   version of your world that would fit on this 128 gig hard drive and you can make your MacBook
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:03.440]   Air 13-inch work for little excursions like that. But I really think that Apple needs to have
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.680]   really, really kick butt processors, and a really, really kick butt MacBook Pro so that it really
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.800]   earns that pro title. Or else there's no reason to have the MacBook Pro.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:16.160]   And I think that as a MacBook Pro user, I do find it very important that I get almost everything
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.880]   that they have connected here. So the three USB, the Firewire, this is kind of the all-in-one on the
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.120]   road and I have to connect the things. I've had an Express Blot Express slot if I need it.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.360]   I've got all the different pieces, I've got the speed, so I think that it is important to have
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.160]   something like that. Now of course, I may not have it for much longer.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.560]   What do you mean, Alex? What could possibly go wrong?
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   There's some rumors that they're going to take my 17-inch away.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:48.640]   I think these rumors are true. And I have a 17-inch MacBook Pro as well.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:56.960]   And for many reasons, I love it, but it's not very portable. It's heavy. And I do a lot of traveling
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.880]   and I walk into and from work every day and this is my computer.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.840]   It's a good workout.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.040]   Yeah, it is a good workout, but I think also, I've had this conversation with people because
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.200]   they always laugh at me and say, "Wow, biggest your MacBook Pro. I mean, it's bigger than you."
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.920]   And I say, "No, but it's very nice when you've got it here in front of you. I mean,
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:21.440]   this is a full computer. Nothing about it seems flimsy or anything, but it's better if it doesn't
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:27.440]   move around all that often." See, I only have a laptop as a computer. I do not have a Mac Pro.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.480]   I don't have an iMac. I don't have anything at home. So whatever I've got has got to be
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.600]   fold up a bowl, put it in a bag, take it with you, and not really, I don't know,
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.920]   give my shoulder bruises too often. But that's kind of what the 17-inch does.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.960]   Even though it's a beautiful machine, I don't think it's good if you're a single computer
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.360]   kind of person. The advantage though is if you put two of them in your backpack,
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.760]   just catch wondering, you can leave it in the airport. You're not really worried about people
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.520]   trying to run away with it because you know you could catch up with them. They'll pick it up and
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:02.320]   realize they're trying to steal the wrong bag. But as long as they, to me, it's really more
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.080]   about performance. We know that we're going to get higher resolution screens. So I think that
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.280]   because the issue that we have is a lot of times we're doing screen captures and I need the full
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:16.000]   1920 by 1200. And so I really need to have that screen capture at that resolution without
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.240]   hooking up another monitor because I'm on the road. The other issue for me is, as I said,
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   having all the power that's in here in the 15 inches, literally I always go into this,
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.000]   should I buy a 15-inch? And I get right up there and the screen resolution has been the only thing
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.320]   stopping me because it's it it tabs out right before the 1920 by.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.520]   Yeah, but with the with the rest of the display though, they might get around that problem. Oh,
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.440]   yeah, you know, you might necessarily need to have a 17-inch. And I think another thing to factor
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.480]   into the equation as well, you know, when they're sort of looking at the pro range of laptops is
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.680]   that they don't really need to worry too much about portability anymore because I think the iPad
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:57.280]   for a lot of pro users as well, the iPad's starting to become the portable computing device. So,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.000]   you know, the laptop again, as I mentioned before, it sort of becomes your laptop becomes your
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.560]   removable desktop, whereas your portable device, you know, if you go to a conference or something,
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.880]   there's no way I'll be carrying a laptop around with me. I'll just take my iPad and use that for,
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.200]   you know, 95% of the stuff that I need to do on a day-to-day basis. But, you know, to have the
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.320]   truck back at back at base, we can go and dump all your video stuff and do your editing and
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.720]   compression stuff. You know, that's the sort of, I think, the area they'll be focusing in on. And
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.320]   if they do bring in the retina technology with the with the laptop range, you know, they can
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:33.040]   actually compress quite a lot of power into a small device, but don't have to worry about it
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.480]   being too portable. Well, I think that one of the problems, though, is that the Apple's iCloud
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:45.760]   solution is not, you know, the perfect system. No. I mean, I think that they have to really work
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:51.120]   on on figuring out how to get the truly creative virtual experience. I mean, so I do a lot. I mean,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:56.480]   obviously we do stuff with iCloud, but an enormous amount of my company runs on Google Docs, you know,
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.880]   you know, and, you know, a lot of stuff here runs on Google Docs. And you get, and the thing is,
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.160]   is that once there's a lot of things I can plan about with Google Docs, I mean, there's a lot of
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.680]   things that frustrate me, and there's a lot of things I get angry about. But I have to say that
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.440]   the idea that everybody's working on the same document, that I can open my computer up in any
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.920]   computer and just open it up and start working and going through the stuff, it is once you get
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   used to that, you cannot go back. And the fact that the Apple Office tools don't, don't allow me to
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.400]   do that, you know, reduces the amount we use them, you know, and if Google, that the spreadsheets in
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:30.560]   Google weren't so completely heinous. You know, we are. Oh boy. There he is. But that's what we got.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:37.040]   Yeah, I use, right. I'm using Microsoft Cloud Drive a lot for as my replacement for Google Docs,
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.760]   is I just don't, I don't like any single one component of them. I know that the Google Docs apps,
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.080]   they're very, very good for what they do, what they do. And their big, big feature is just a simple,
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.480]   simple effect, as you say, they work on every single browser so that the computer becomes irrelevant.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.960]   But it's just not an environment that I can work in. But Don, I mean, I totally agree with you. I mean,
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:00.240]   this is, I'm going to be gone for a little bit less than a week here. I'm giving a presentation,
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:06.560]   doing lots and lots of work. This is the first time that I've put such faith in my iPad that
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.840]   I've actually left my Mac book at home for this entire trip. I'm Skyping right here from an iPad
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:18.720]   earlier today, when Google Chrome, excuse me, Google Drive got released. I just VPN back to my
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.680]   iMac back in my office through the iPad to do the, those wanted to look quick things that needed to
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.400]   be done on a desktop operating system. But other than that, I'm doing presentations from this. I'm
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.320]   doing all my word processing from it. I'm doing some project management from it. This is really,
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.600]   my, this is, this is the dog food test for me for the iPad, because before now, before now,
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:42.720]   and we thought was for, and with the previous generation of iPad, it was something that if I
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:48.000]   were gone for maybe just an overnight or maybe just two nights, especially if like, I'm giving a
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.920]   presentation, but that presentation is very, very simple and it's completely locked down. I know I'm
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.600]   not going to have to make any really big edits to it. Then I would just, then I would say, okay,
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.800]   in this case, I can take my iPad with me. But now, let's all either fly or am I going to die,
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.680]   with just spending a week in Europe with just just an iPad and a keyboard.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.520]   Now, now what do you think of the idea of this kind of hybrid that's been, you know,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:16.800]   CNET has an article about this talk now that the Apple, the next laptop could be, could kind of
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.720]   match halfway in between the MacBook Pro and the Mac and the MacBook Air. Does that seem like a
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:28.240]   possibility of trying to find a happy medium between the two? Well, in terms of design, I could
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.480]   believe that. I could certainly believe when trying to make something as powerful as a MacBook Pro,
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:38.800]   with the same advantages of size and weight as a MacBook Air, I think that they're starting to run
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:44.400]   it. I think they're starting to have a few collisions because I'm having a hard time seeing
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.480]   the real need for an 11-inch Air right now because I don't think the, I think the 11-inch is the
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:56.320]   least successful of the Air line because you have a, it's a small, small form factory of a small,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.720]   small screen, which makes you have to really adjust the way that you work in order to make
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:06.160]   these smaller, smaller components really, really work for you. Meanwhile, you've got this really
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.640]   wonderful iPad here, which you can kit out as a top of the line machine with the keyboard,
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.240]   with all the accessories, with all the software you need to make it into something that can do,
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.880]   I would say 85 to 90 percent of what a MacBook Air 11-inch can do with the added advantage of
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.120]   also being a really good ebook reader, a really good comic book reader, a really good movie player.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:32.560]   So I still see the relevance of the 13-inch Air. I'm having a harder and harder time thinking of a
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:38.080]   use case in which I would recommend the 11-inch Air to anybody because if they're looking for the
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:45.040]   11-inch Air, they are willing to accept sort of something less than a full laptop experience.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.560]   And if you're going to go for something less than a full laptop experience, why not save a
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.080]   couple hundred bucks and get a battery that lasts four hours longer and wind up with an iPad?
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.280]   Well, I think the problem is though, is that if you really need a keyboard, that's why I have an
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:00.240]   11- I have an 11- You have an 11-inch, exactly. It's like a little shuttle flop.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.800]   You know, you got the, you know, you like, you start from enterprise and then it's like that
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   little shuttle that has to go out and- You've got, I mean, Andy's going, he's leaving the country
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.160]   for a week and he has his iPad and his keyboard because he thinks it's sufficient. I mean, that's
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.960]   that's the problem I have to is when I really need to like hammer out an email quickly,
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:23.600]   I have to reach for the laptop because it's just, it's OS 10, the way that I'm used to, and I just
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.160]   need to do something real quick in a tab. And the iPad still requires me to think a little bit
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:32.720]   differently about how to arrive at the same place. It's still a very uni tasky sort of thing.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:38.400]   The biggest difficulty is always what happens when I need to look something up in a webpage
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.120]   while I'm writing something. And there's just no- The fact that Apple doesn't even allow you to do,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.440]   if you've got the keyboard hooked up, you can't even do a command tab just to simply quickly do
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.960]   the equivalent of the multi-finger stroke to switch between apps. Apple, I really hope that Apple
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.440]   starts to appreciate that there are people who are using a keyboard to turn the iPad into a
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:02.480]   real computer. And they give them, I wish they would give us some of that sort of extra desktop
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.920]   experience into the iPad without compromising the iPad experience.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.800]   You know, I think that the, yeah, I find it pretty difficult to do and the cutting and pasting,
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.920]   like I want to get something from one application into another is so I find very painful.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:23.600]   You know what also drives me absolutely that crazy is, okay, I've got a file somewhere that
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:30.640]   I've been working on on my iPad. Okay, and then I'm back into my email and I think,
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.760]   oh yeah, I've got that thing I want to attach. Can't do that. You have to attach it from the
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:42.400]   program that it was created in and it doesn't come up on a daily basis, but when it does,
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.760]   it is so frustrating. Well, then you have to hit share and then you have to remember who
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.240]   all the people that you were, you know, all the breaks, your email thread.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.440]   All you want to do is hit reply and put it in there. But instead you have to do this.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.280]   Gosh, that makes me nuts. That's why I go back to my 11 inch.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.720]   And that's why I think that there is, there is a market for people who want something that's
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:05.360]   kind of the same form, well, not the same form factor, but almost the same size and weight,
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:11.440]   as let's say an iPad, but there's a keyboard attached. It's OS 10. It's not iOS. I know a lot
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.480]   of folks at Leo included who love their 11 inch. They seem a little, a little too small for me.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.680]   I like it in economy. When I'm sitting in economy, which I said in a lot.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.680]   Yeah. Yeah. I'm also a
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:27.120]   Don't play that. I said. Yeah, full screen in line goes a long way to making it a much more
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.200]   pleasurable experience using the 11 inch because, you know, it was, it feels like it was, you know,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.440]   the full screen mode is actually made for the 11 inch because that then makes it a lot easier
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:39.520]   to switch between screens and to get to use up most of the screen real estate.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.400]   We're going back to the original point though about, you know, the new laptops and whether or not
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.720]   we'll see a hybrid of the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. I think that the thing that's going to
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:51.040]   sort of make or break it is what they do with the port. Someone that they do still go ahead and,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.880]   and you know, do we, do we think really at the next pro level laptop, they're still going to
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.800]   include a firewire pull? That was one of the questions on the, on the online. Someone from our,
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:04.480]   IRC chat was, was asking about that. Do we, do we think firewire is, is going to stay around or
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:09.680]   is, is Thunderbolt the new fireware? Andy, do you think Thunderbolt is replacing it?
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:15.440]   Yeah, I think Thunderbolt's going to replace fireware. I really do think that Apple wants
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:22.000]   that thinner form factor. I'd be surprised if they ditched the Mac Pro line just yet. I still think
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.360]   that there's so many trade-offs when you're going to an SSD because they're, they're people who just
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:33.760]   don't have that kind of money to put in to get a, to get a, to operate to a 512 gig SSD that even
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:40.960]   a 256 gig is not going to do. I don't think that the MacBook Air as a rich, as it's, as it's created
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.840]   right now is good for those people who can only afford to have one really, really big, really,
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.880]   really good laptops. Excuse me, one really, really good computer. They can't afford to have
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.640]   like the big, big honking desktop and then they're super lightweight. They need to have one machine
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.600]   that candles everything for them. And right now, I don't think the MacBook Air has been really
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.920]   covered for them. So I'd be surprised if it's this year that you start to see the end of the
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.120]   MacBook Pro line with the spinning hard drive and with the full festoonery ports on the sides.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.600]   Now the, there is a report on the antivirus flashback still, still infects more than 500,000
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.640]   Macs. So this is really the first virus that we've seen that actually got out into the wild in a
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:26.080]   long time. I mean, you know, you hear about viruses, but, but this one is still rooting around. So
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:30.000]   this is something that people still have to pay attention to. Don, is there, is there a way to,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:37.520]   and it's not, I'm, I'm being corrected that it's not a virus, but it's not where Apple should have
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:43.200]   pushed through the flashback malware software update. And as long as you're updating,
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:48.400]   as long as you pay attention to software update when it prompts you, when you're good to go.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:52.960]   There's people like me that don't. And the reason is we're in production and we get pretty
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:56.880]   superstitious. I don't have five minutes right now to restart. No, it's not even, I don't have five
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.840]   minutes. It's like, I'm in the middle of production. If it does something, I don't expect it to do all
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:04.240]   the applications that I have. I don't want to, I don't want to change anything. Right. When I was
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.520]   working in Star Wars, I think we used After Effects 3, 1 or 3, 0 or something like that. And 4,
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.200]   like there was like a whole nother, it was like a whole different application by the time we got
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.080]   out of the, out of the movie, because we didn't want to, no one wanted to change anything, because
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.760]   you didn't want to change it, what you had to save. You didn't want to change how things, you know,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.120]   interact. And so that's always the, that's always the challenge with any kind of upgrades. And so
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.880]   some people will ignore that for a long time because they don't want to change those pieces,
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.520]   but this one might be worth it. I think that's all we want to. Andy, is this a real, is this a real
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:40.000]   concern? Yeah, it really is. This isn't one of those theoretical, hey, if the right sequence of
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.400]   events happens, then maybe someone could maybe turn this to a real thing. No, people are really
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.680]   getting infected with this sort of stuff. It's not so widespread that everybody knows one who had,
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.240]   everybody knows someone who has an infection, but it's not difficult to find people who
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.840]   ran their utility and found, got the bad news and said the good news. So yeah, you definitely got,
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.680]   you definitely got to install this, you definitely got to make sure that you change your attitude
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:09.520]   towards updates because stuff just got real from that community right now, where this suddenly
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.840]   became something you have that has to be on your radar. This idea of malware infesting your system.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.240]   And there is just so people know that there is a specific flashback malware removal tool on the
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.480]   apple site. I think you can just search through support. I'm because the direct link is not
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.640]   something it's easy to say on the air. So, right. I think the issue with this though, Alex, is that,
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.160]   and I think for the first time, it was, it's a malware exploit that's been delivered
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.720]   without knowing about it. In the past, we've always felt technically savvy and we wouldn't go to
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.480]   suspicious websites. We wouldn't click on links. We thought, well, you know, we're going to do that.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.960]   This time it was like a drive-by software in store. You literally had to just visit
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.680]   a site that had the infection and you could actually get it on your machine. So, it's a lot
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.560]   more serious in that respect. So no matter how careful you'd been, there's still a chance that
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.240]   you might have actually got to speak the malware. And I think that sort of changes the, you know,
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.440]   that changes the whole way we shouldn't start looking at these things and take them a bit more
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.760]   seriously now. All right. Before we get into some of the other news on MacPray Weekly this week,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:21.040]   let Tassad over to the time traveler himself, Lila Porres. Actually, can... Oh, do you need to go,
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.000]   Andy? I'm sorry. I do need to go. So, there's a good chance for me to leap out. I probably need
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.760]   to start going through security, start taking things out of my pockets. There's an alarming
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.720]   amount of metal objects and batteries. Removing the Swiss Army knives from your pockets,
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.480]   the usual. All right, Andy, we'll have a great flight. Thanks so much for joining us from on-root.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.640]   Exactly. That's nice talking, you guys. Have a great week. Bye-bye. See you next week on MacPray
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.840]   Weekly. All right. On to Leo, time traveler extraordinaire. Thanks Sarah Moore with us,
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.680]   Sarah N Company on MacPray Weekly. Just a little bit. I wanted to take a minute to tell you about
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:04.960]   our friends at gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com. They've really focused gazelle down to their 13 top
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.800]   products that they sell. The ones that almost everybody sells on gazelle.com. That means it's an
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.120]   easier experience for you. You can get in there, you can click and get right to the product you
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.080]   want, whether it's an iPhone or what a sell, I should say. Whether it's an iPhone, an iPad,
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:28.880]   an Android phone, they support some Galaxy phones, many of the Android phones. Gazelle is incredible
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:34.560]   because when, you know, just go there, gazelle.com. And let's say you got an old iPad, you want to

[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.440]   right away. They even pay the postage. So it really is a great deal. The point being though,
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.720]   none of these products are getting more valuable. Maybe in 100 years they'll be antiques. But right
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   now they're dropping in price and they're dropping fast. So every day you wait is it is some money
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.800]   less. You're going to get a bucket too less. You're going to get. So go to, don't wait. You've
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.600]   heard me talk about it. You've been putting it off. Clear out that gadget closet. Go to gazelle.com.

[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.080]   Thanks Leo. You're the best. And then he's back. He just comes in. And then he's gone. And he thought
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:57.440]   he was a Norway. How come chair? So anyway, have you heard about the Steve Jobs Lost Hapes?
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:05.920]   Okay. So I tend to, I'm sort of of the camp that feels like we've got the Steve Jobs biography
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:13.040]   then we have the variety of other biographies that are more unofficial. And then the people
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.200]   coming out of the woodwork saying, "Well, I used to visit him once a month in his home in the last
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.640]   days." And I guess I'm starting to get to the point where I think, you know, I'm fascinated with
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.120]   the man. He was obviously a genius in many ways. A very interesting person, a very complex individual.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:33.760]   But how many more of these lost interviews are we going to unearth? Do you think that he would
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.400]   say that too? Like, okay, you all have to move on now. Well, you know, that's a good question because
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.680]   I think that he was pretty aware of the fact that he was a brilliant mind.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:50.560]   And I also think that they spent a lot of time institutionalizing his approach to things at Apple
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:56.240]   when he had this kind of brush with death earlier. I think there was a lot of effort at Apple. I
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.360]   mean, we've read reports that there was a lot of effort at Apple to make sure that they kind of
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.560]   document, you know, a certain approach, a certain piece of that. Don, do you think that have you
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.760]   heard much from these last tapes? Yeah, I had to read through the article. I mean,
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.800]   it's quite interesting. I think there's still a lot we can learn from the guy. I mean, you know,
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.200]   obviously, he, you know, Sarah said he's a genius and he did a lot. And the nice thing about this
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.000]   particular article is that it tends to focus more on the sort of wilderness years, you know,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.480]   after he left Apple and before he went back again, and what he actually did with Pixar and
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:32.960]   next and stuff and how that sort of molded him to, you know, to lead to the Apple that we know now.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.680]   So I think, you know, we're not getting too more because you're sentimental and those sorts of
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.280]   articles. I think where we can actually learn about what he did and his approach to various
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.760]   things. I think there's still a lot we can we can learn about, you know, how he actually
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.600]   sort of made all those major improvements and sort of changed from what he was to what he became.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.400]   So, you know, I still find it fascinating really. And I'm still, I'm still looking for the,
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:01.360]   or not looking for, but you know, I still enjoyed the biography, but it wasn't quite what I was
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.040]   looking for. It wasn't it didn't quite cover the aspects of Steve Jobs that I'm particularly
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.600]   interested in with having the sort of the interest in Apple and its technologies and its, you know,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.720]   its history. So I'm sure we'll see plenty more of these sort of coming out the woodwork and
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.040]   as long as they're genuine, as long as they're authentic and as long as they don't start repeating
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.520]   themselves ad nauseam, you know, I don't mind like I'm quite interested in learning more about the
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.600]   guy. I think what it really shows you also is that he just was very focused on the same thing
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.000]   all the time. Like he really wanted to revolutionize the way education worked. And in a lot of ways,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.920]   a lot of people talk about the iBook, you know, and the iBook author and a lot of what those
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.720]   things are real, those were real passionate projects for him of being able to kind of turn
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.960]   that inside out because he, yeah. Well, I think, I think one of the things that people focus on
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.680]   with Steve Jobs is we all have obsessions and we'd all love to revolutionize all sorts of things,
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.400]   but to actually say, and then look what I made. Well, and to stay focused on it. And I change the
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.880]   entire industry, that's, that's rare. And to be able to stay focused on it and really pay attention
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.800]   to what's important in that area. I think it's a lot of times what's hard is that you get in this
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.120]   an industry and you understand that there's stuff missing, but you're so deep into it, you can't
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.680]   figure out what's truly important, like how to distill it down into something that can actually
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.640]   move forward. And I think that that's one of the things that made him different is a lot of people
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.440]   have great ideas, but he was able to distill that down into an actionable plan and keep people
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:25.920]   focused on an actual plan. So anyway, it is interesting. So we'll see. I'm sure there will be more books
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:33.200]   coming out. Also, you know, do you guys do you guys use Instagram? Oh, yes, every day. I have it
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.840]   on my phone, but I must admit, I tend not to use it. I'm of the opinion that, you know, I like to
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.920]   take photographs, but I don't like to make them all muddy and dirty and filters and stuff. It
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:47.760]   doesn't, you know, I can't quite get my head around that. To ruin a perfectly good photo with
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.280]   the film. But there's a whole subset of Instagram users who hashtag no filter because they agree
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:59.040]   with you. Are you a part of the community? I tried to start a new group called filter free. It
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:06.400]   didn't catch on, but I tried. That was one of those great ideas that just, you weren't able to
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:11.440]   focus in. There'd be a whole product line built around filter free. But now the thing is those
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.320]   filters are great if you've got a pretty crappy camera. So if it's, you know, on the old iPhone,
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.080]   when the camera was abysmal, those filters actually did a good job. But now we've got these really
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.760]   high res beautiful photos that we can get on our iPhone. I don't really mess about with the
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.720]   filters too much. Yeah. So anyway, the, with Instagram, the senior vice president Phil Schiller
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:36.560]   dumps Instagram when they expanded to, to Android, and didn't just stop using it, which is what I do.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.640]   I didn't do it. I don't have a protest or anything else. I just got bored. And, but the,
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.240]   there's a difference between neglecting and deleting. Exactly. So not only did he, he didn't just
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.480]   neglect it, he killed it. And then he Twitter that he tweeted that he killed it. Like it was like,
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:59.200]   it was a very clear message to, to the folks at Instagram that he wasn't amused. Well, he,
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.480]   according to Schiller, the app jumped the shark when the Android community was allowed in. And that's
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.520]   really, I thought that was a little, I thought, I really felt like I think that's very petty.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.080]   Actually, I do. But I also think it's very petty that so many iOS users were like,
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.000]   ew, Instagram people are in here now. This sucks. These pictures are going to suck. And then there
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.480]   were a lot of comparisons. This is what the iPhone can take of that, you know, old truck out in the
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.720]   backyard. And this is what the Android picture can take. And look how muddy that second picture is.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.200]   And it's like, I mean, are you guys for real? Exactly. I mean, and, and as soon as you take,
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.080]   because I have to say arguably, you know, the, the galaxy to us, which is, I have my other phone,
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.360]   is, I mean, the pictures it takes us are gorgeous, you know, and so, so I, and that would be the,
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:53.040]   the place that I would think, I do think it's silly. I mean, I don't, as I said, to me, it,
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.280]   it seemed like an awful much to do about nothing. It was actually made a big deal.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.920]   It was before the, the take over from Facebook as well. So that wasn't sort of anything to do
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.480]   there. It was just the fact that, there was a lot of, a lot of discussions going around at the
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.080]   time when the Android client came out. And I'm not sure if it was a fully featured, I mean,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.040]   I don't use Android so I don't know. I'm not sure if it was a fully featured client or not,
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.880]   but there was lots of discussions going around the year into it. And I don't know, but it seems
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.680]   strange for him to, to actually pull a plug and do it so publicly as well. Although I think it was
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.560]   just in reference to someone who sent them an email or a tweet in the, perhaps, mightn't have
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.840]   expected it to be publicized. But of course, if you someone like feels sure that anything you say
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.880]   or do is going to attract attention. So perhaps he should have been a little bit more.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:40.400]   And I think I do, I will say from a calculating perspective, him publicly doing that,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.320]   tells a lot of other iPhone developers that he does care. That that that, you know, it does
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:53.600]   matter to Apple if you are in the Apple, you know, sphere, or if you're just doing it, you know,
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.440]   if you're just out there making apps for anybody, you know, and I think that I think that, but I
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.800]   think that for a large, one of the most popular apps out there, it doesn't matter. But I think
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   that that definitely can affect the trajectory of smaller app developers who are thinking about,
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:14.480]   well, should I dip into the Android, you know, world and realizing like as I'm building up,
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.240]   I'm doing pretty well in iOS and the thing you have to worry about when you do this. And I think
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.120]   that this is the underlying thing. Well, to me, it does seem petty in some ways. But the underlying
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.160]   communication is we have to remember that there is no the way the app store works, the way all
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.680]   that stuff works is very centralized. And we have to remember that, you know, there's just someone
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:37.600]   picking that, you know, you know, and so, you know, getting on the wrong side of, you know,
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.280]   getting on the wrong side of that, that picking process is very expensive, you know, to a developer.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.600]   And this doesn't necessarily have to be a big knock on Android. Before,
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:54.000]   Instagram was available on Android, it already had a huge community, what 30 million or so.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.440]   And well, I've noticed with some of my friends who have a lot of followers, you tend to get like
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.440]   a degradation of cool comments, you know, you have a lot of people saying, please check out my
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.600]   profile. And it's like, this is all just kind of spamming. There's too many people. It's growing
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:13.680]   to exponentially. So the fact that a bunch of Android users were starting to jump on board,
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.160]   and they did, I mean, I think it gained, you know, what five million users in this first weekend on
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:24.160]   Android tends to just kind of maybe dilute the experience at that so much a knock on a rival
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.040]   operating system. You think, well, I guess I'm just trying to say, well, it feels sure there
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.120]   isn't being really petty against Android. What is the reason? I'm saying, I don't think he's being,
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.960]   I don't think he's, I think in the surface, I think it looks petty. But I think that in the
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.480]   in the deeper end of things, I think it is a communication to smaller app developers and
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.320]   developers who think they're going to just, you know, go out that that that it does matter to Apple
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.280]   that you're, you know, it's a very subtle way of saying that Apple does care about whether people
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.120]   are exclusively working with the iPhone, you know, the iOS infrastructure or whether they're not.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:59.440]   And again, for a large successful app, it won't matter for a smaller developer who is just starting
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.200]   to get, you know, get moving. When you know that most people who are buying applications are on the
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:11.440]   iOS and free is really the most successful solution on the Android, I think that's still
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.040]   pretty much the case. If you're trying to make a business out of it, it may make you think twice
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.120]   about doing both at the same time, for instance, you know, that you might, and it's not that Apple
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.920]   would ignore you, but they might pay more attention to you because you are, because you're doing
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.520]   something that's more specific. So who knows. Also, Tim Cook, of course, now is he has made
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:38.640]   times 100 most influential people. So he just, I should hope so. He's moved in. He's moved in.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.680]   Steve moved out. He moved right in. It's, you know, that's, but you know, if you are, it turns out
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.280]   that if you are the CEO of the largest publicly traded company in the United States, people think
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.920]   that you have some sayings are somehow influencing others somehow, somehow having an effect on
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.000]   on other people's decisions. So, so anyways, we just thought we'd let you all know, in case you're
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.360]   wondering how Tim's doing, but now it's time for our tips of the week. Right. Who is doing the
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.040]   Mac OS tip? Because Andy left. Was that you, Don? Oh, can we throw? Can we throw you one?
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.200]   Um, but I'll give you a minute. I'll give you a minute. All right. Give me a minute then go.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.800]   I'll do the iOS tip. I think Andy put that Andy usually does it and then he left.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.720]   Yeah. I think I think what we see in our personal doc here is Andy's tip.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:35.200]   Yes. Uh, creates smart playlists. So that, you know, Andy's tip was going to be something we
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.160]   won't say it because he might want to. Yeah, he might want to use it. He might want to do it
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.920]   next week when he has a check. We don't want to, we don't want to remove that quality pick
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:49.040]   from Andy's environment. So my, my, my iOS pick may seem, um, simple, but, uh, it's very useful. So I
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.280]   have, you have the smart little, I do the smart cover. I use it both as a cover and, and as my,
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.040]   and when you shut it, does it, when you turn it, turn it on. Yeah, it works fine. And when you
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:04.160]   shut it, oh, it's still off. Oh, it's weird. Turn it on first. I think when you turn it off or
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.520]   did the battery die. No, yeah. See, that was weird. It's never done that before until just now.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.360]   Just because it was near my performance anxiety. His mind was talking to it. Maybe so. Yeah, but
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.680]   no, I don't. The magnets you're talking about. Not a problem. And this is the smart cover that I
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.360]   bought with iPad two. See, I find that to be a bug, not a feature. So does it see this? Yeah.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.760]   See my mind sticks and everything else. But when I go like this, it doesn't, doesn't, uh,
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.000]   it doesn't turn on the way it's supposed to. It doesn't, it doesn't turn on. And that's actually
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.680]   a very important thing for me. Okay. So here's the deal. The problem with your eye, your eye,
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.360]   this little magnet thing is that, yeah, it turns on when you go like this, but it also turns on.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.240]   Can you see this? You have an overhead camera? You can see my, uh,
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:50.400]   over the camera. I have one, but it's, uh, it's over Sarah. That's fine. So, uh,
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:58.320]   so I need to get my roots done. So the, uh, so when you turn it this way, that's fine.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.240]   And that's what you wanted to do. Uh, but when you, here's the big problem is I put,
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.360]   I've already established that I put a couple laptops in my backpack. You know, in the little slot.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.600]   Yeah. And then I throw this in the little slot. And then here's what happens is that it gets pushed
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:16.880]   like that. Uh, yeah. And then every time I pull it out, the batteries did. What? So this is the
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.200]   little tip, but just to know that when you get, when that happens right there, it'll, it'll turn on.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.600]   This is why you consider it a bug. It'll turn on. And then it'll just burn your battery all the
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.920]   way to the ground. So I just keep on going like this. I throw my, uh, my iPad and my Mac book air
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.080]   in my little messenger bag every day. I think a bunch of other stuff. And I've never had this
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.440]   problem. Not once. I have a lot of stuff in my slot. I mean, do you have, I mean, you might just
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.000]   need a better bag. It's a great bag. I'm not giving up my bag. I don't know. I mean, my bag's got a
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.880]   nice little back area here. Okay. Now we're having a bag discussion. We're having a bag. So here,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.960]   so here's, so it's nice to see what you have. It's a, it's a, it's a, Timbuktu.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:01.200]   This is a Mucktu. Did you design it online on their little flash app? Um, no, I just went to the
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:05.280]   store because there's a Timbuktu store near me, but this is actually a huge messenger bag because
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:11.360]   initially I needed my 17 inch MacBook Pro to fit in here. So it's kind of big, but you've got this
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:17.280]   whole extra area. Um, that's, it's nice and I like the Timbuktu. I used to have a Timbuktu for a long
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.840]   time. The problem with it is, is that when your bag is, my bag, standard weight is a little over
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.280]   40 pounds. I shouldn't say that because if someone on TSA knows that, then they'll take my bag away,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.440]   make me check it. But anyway, so, um, uh, I can't put it over one shoulder or hurt my back. Yeah.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.520]   Like, I mean, like, really hurt my back. And, um, so things are just slipping and sliding. So,
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:39.760]   so this is the, you know, I need to have a backpack and, um, so this is, but there's the slot. I still,
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.600]   it's a great slot for one. It's just not a great slot for two 17 inches. Well, I think you've made
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.560]   your life very complicated. No, it's, you know, and then see, but then see, I have my little, my
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.920]   little slot down here. I have all kinds of stuff in here. I mean, I'm impressed. In a way, I feel
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:02.080]   like everything's so tight that the, the, the iPad really shouldn't be moving around all that much.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.240]   You know, you need, you need rubber bands for your smart cover problem solved. Well, you probably
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.960]   got rubber bands in there already. I don't think I have any rubber bands. I think I have, uh, no,
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:17.280]   I don't, I don't have anything but a rubber band. So anyway, you're welcome. The, uh, but what I did
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.240]   do is, is there is, you can actually, um, what I was going to say, my little tip, if this ever
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.960]   happens to you, it obviously doesn't happen to very many people because it doesn't happen to Sarah.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:30.240]   And you know, it's, it's, it's, I'm sure there are people watching who say, yeah, that happens
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.920]   really well. If you wonder why it's, it's going down, you can turn it off in your general settings,
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.240]   your iPad cover lock and unlock. So it just automatically turns on. And if you're having that
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.080]   problem, which I have, now here's the one thing you have to remember is it doesn't turn off either.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.400]   So when you go like this, right, you go like that, you got to remember it's still a problem. So,
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:54.080]   so what you have to do is, um, uh, I do not have a black magic camera in my bag. Just someone was
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.360]   asking on there. I wish I had one. Anyway, so, um, that's a good tip. It's a good tip. Anyway,
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.800]   I've never, um, I mean, it's possible that this is happening to me and I just don't realize.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.720]   Sometimes, but I, but I charge my iPad every night. So yeah, see, that's, that's good. That's a good
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:15.600]   little period habit to get into if possible. Every day. Well, you know what I, I, I use this,
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.520]   like sleep, it's sleep tracking software and it docks right into an alarm clock. So it's like,
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.880]   it's a very easy excuse for me to wake up in the morning and I have a hundred percent battery
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.800]   because I charged overnight. But since I've done that, I'd have to try really hard to, to
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:36.160]   blow to my battery, even by using it all day, watching movies and doing all sorts of stuff. So,
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:41.200]   I usually get stopped by the fact that I'm, I mean, I spend half my time in a hotel room and, and so I,
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.880]   uh, run out of when I start charging things. Power strip stuff. Yes. Power management issue.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.640]   Yeah. Power management issue. Anyway, that's it. Don, do you have a, have you thought of a
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.360]   Mac OS that we want? Yeah, I'll do a, I'll do a quick Safari related one. And that's to do with
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.640]   Flash. Now, if you buy a new Mac, and you, you won't actually have Flash installed by default.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.000]   And although that's, it's getting fewer and fewer, there are still some websites that have
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.360]   Flash content that you might want to see. Now, you can go ahead and install Flash, but people do
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.000]   tend to have problems with, um, you know, processors racking up when you're accessing Flash content,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   etc. And the sort of general consensus is if you can get away with not installing Flash,
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.360]   that might be a good idea. So why do if I've got a machine that hasn't got Flash on, um, you can
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.240]   get some extensions that will allow you to run, um, you know, YouTube, etc. And they will just
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:34.080]   replace the standard player. But a nice elegant solution is to use Chrome. And Chrome browser
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.880]   has got its own built in Flash implementation. So that if you find a page that has got Flash
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.640]   on and you haven't got Flash installed on your machine, you can quickly open Chrome and go to
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.360]   that page. Now the tip is how to open Chrome quickly and actually go to the page that you want to
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.880]   display the Flash content on. Uh, if you go into Safari and then go into Safari preferences and then
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.520]   go to the advanced tab, down at the bottom of the system preference, sorry, of the, um,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:03.040]   advanced preference pane is an option to show the developer menu in the menu bar. And what that,
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.680]   what happens then is, uh, in your Safari menu bar, you get next to bookmarks, you get an extra menu
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:14.320]   option called develop. And the very first entry in the, in the develop dropdown menu is open in Chrome.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.000]   Or it depends what else you've got installed on your system. But if you're on a page, go to the
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.320]   develop menu and then select open in Chrome and the page you're on will actually open in the Chrome
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.400]   browser and you'll be able to see your Flash content. That's great. That's great. Of course,
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:33.120]   I just use the Chrome browser. Otherwise, yeah. I'll just use the Chrome browser. I don't use,
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:39.120]   I mean, I like Safari. I like that. I'm often, so I stick with Safari. No, I have to admit,
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.680]   I got used to, and now I'm so used to doing searches into the main bar in Chrome that,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.720]   that I keep on doing that in Safari. Oh my gosh. That kills me. You know, uh, mountain lion Safari,
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.920]   takes care of that. They're going to let you add searches into the regular, uh, address bar.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.240]   That's good. Which makes a lot of sense to me. I'm sure there are people who disagree in like the
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:04.480]   two to be separate. Funny story. Last Sunday, uh, or no, actually last Tuesday, it was April 17th.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.280]   So, you know, I have five hours to go to submit my taxes online because I'm the kind of person
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.280]   who likes to wait till the very last minute. This is in the US, usually on April 15th, but this year
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.760]   it was April 17th for a variety of reasons. Um, and I'm, I'm using TurboTax and I'm, I've got to the
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.600]   end and you know, you get to the point where you've, you've added in your credit card information.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.920]   I owed some taxes. We're good to go. And then it just says, I'm going to just do a final error sweep.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:34.720]   Just to make sure we're fine. Okay. And there's this kind of strange persistent error. And I can't
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:40.160]   figure it out. And it's like, uh, it's an error in, in, in one of my boxes where I'm supposed to enter a
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.920]   zero. And I do that. And somehow it's calculating. There's a plug in the software, basically, on
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:51.520]   TurboTax's side. And I don't have time to figure it out because I'm about to be laid on my taxes.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:56.720]   And I get on the phone with customer support at TurboTax. I wait a better part of two hours
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.760]   because of course everyone else is calling them with, with their customer support questions.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.800]   Probably the same bug. Probably. And I get someone on the phone finally, and I explain it to him. And
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:12.160]   he's like, um, okay. And we go through a bunch of, we go through basically just a bunch of sort of
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.280]   trial and error. And finally, long story short, turns out that TurboTax does not work with this
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:23.920]   particular software issue in Chrome, which is what I'm using. And he says, well, just switch over
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.560]   to IE, you'll be fine. And I said, no, it's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.040]   Just go back to the nineties. You'll be fine. But I'm like, how is this? What? Yeah. That's the
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.120]   solution. Yeah. That's your best. TurboTax, the largest tax software company in the nation.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.560]   Tells you to go back to IE. Tells me, oh, you're on Chrome. Why didn't you say so? That won't work.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:52.080]   Anyway, you may have used, uh, um, TurboTax to file electronically while using the Chrome browser
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.920]   and say, what are you talking about? I did this just fine. It was a specific error because of
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.680]   some of the business stuff that I was doing. But, uh, anyway, turns out that Safari worked as well.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:07.360]   So he didn't know what Safari was, but. Yeah, no, my, my, the same way that IE did.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.520]   So fortunately, it wasn't a stress for me because April 15th is the day that I filed my extension.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.160]   Actually, it's not even the day that I found my extension is the day that my wife,
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.320]   no, she actually, she, somebody do that. And then, and then I just asked her like a week later,
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.800]   did we actually handle the taxes? And then she says, yes, yes, we did.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.680]   Thank you for the help. And then she looks at me sarcastically and then we, I say,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.920]   should I get a glass of wine? All right. So anyway, um, that's, that's how I handle my taxes.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.320]   So, uh, Don, do you have a pick for the, oh, we, we, uh, before we get to the picks of the week,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.200]   we got picks of the week coming. But before that, we're going to go travel back in time.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.400]   We got more Mac, Rick coming up in just a little bit Mac, Rick weekly with Sarah and
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:52.320]   company. But I want to interrupt here a little bit, give them a break and talk to you about carbonite.com,
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.400]   the best way to back up, you know, Steve Gibson was just a honor. If you didn't hear it, the new
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.600]   security now, he's reviewing cloud storage and he gave an A plus to carbonite. He said, you know,
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.520]   I really like it. They, they let you, uh, encrypt your file privately that preserve your privacy.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.320]   It is cloud storage. He was reviewing it as a cloud storage, uh, service. But really, what
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.040]   it's all about, carbonite is about backing up. You know, you gotta back up if you want to save
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:21.840]   your data and you can't do it just whenever you think about it. You, you can do it to a hard drive
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.080]   next to your computer, but you're really important. If, if you ask me, the most important thing is
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.160]   automatic. So you don't have to remember it. Continuous. So it backs up every change you make
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.800]   to every file as it happens. Back up to the cloud, the internet where it's safe. Because, you know,
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.840]   if it's next to the computer and you might still want to do that, in fact, I do. The problem is,
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:45.280]   what if there's a fire or flood? I know we don't want to think about these things,
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.720]   but disasters happen and don't make it a double disaster by also losing all your data.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:57.600]   Back up offsite continuously, securely, HIPAA compliant and everything, you do the encryption
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:03.120]   to carbonite.com. Here's the deal. You go to carbonite.com right now. They've got several plans
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.400]   starting at $59 a computer per year. I probably should say that upfront because it sounds like
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.960]   $59 a good deal per year. Less than five bucks a month for everything on your computer.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:20.880]   Mac or PC, they also have programs for multiple discs, multiple computers. It's all there at
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.840]   carbonite.com. Use the offer code Mac break when you sign up. You get two weeks for free. And then
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:34.000]   if you decide to buy, you get two extra months for free, 14 months for the price of 12. C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.960]   carbonite.com. You got to back it up to get it back. So do it right with carbonite.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.160]   I think it does pretty well. I know when I've used that the time traveling, it really takes it
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.840]   out of me. I get some series hangover. Sometimes migraines. Melatonin, I think.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.280]   Oh, is that it? I heard it was orange juice and water. When you become a pro.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:01.200]   Yeah, you've got to make sure that you can sleep on a dime during the wormhole.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.240]   Yes. It's hard to sleep during the wormhole. Well, it's violent.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.280]   Yeah, it is. I mean, it's the bouncing around and it's mostly the lights.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.200]   I just can't. I can't. I can't do that. Protective goggles. A must.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.080]   I have something at the house. I'll have to try that. You have some in your backpack, too.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.920]   You have everything else in there. You have a lunch. Protective goggles.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:30.000]   I actually do have my lunch in my backpack. Anyway, so Don, do you have a tip for the week?
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.200]   Let's go with just a simple iPhone application for this week. Obviously,
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.800]   we'll work on the iPad as well. It's really nice the way iPhone apps work on the new iPad as well.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.960]   They zoom up really nicely. This one is called Drafts by Agile Tortoise.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.480]   It's a cheap one. It's 69P or 99 cents. Basically, what it does is it allows you to,
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.400]   it's sort of like a jotter. As soon as you open the application, it gives you a blank
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.640]   text entry area that you can just type away. So it's very quick to actually, if you have a thought
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.960]   of some text that you want to capture quickly, just open Drafts, enter the text.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.360]   And the one's the text is entered. You can sort of keep notes that they will sort of stack up
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.440]   behind each other. But what you can do then is you can use Markdown. If you're into Markdown format,
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.120]   you can format them with Markdown. Once you have your text, you can send them up as an email.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   You can send them to applications. So you can post a tweet directly from the application,
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.520]   or you can send it to your Twitter client. It's just really, it finally went to my doc very,
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:26.480]   very quickly, just a one tap to enter into a text entry field, put down your thoughts and
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.480]   either come out of the application and do something with it later or send it on to another application.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.560]   I think at the last release, they've just put on the focus integration in there as well, so that,
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.400]   you know, if you've got a task, you can enter the task and then send it to Omnifocus without having
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.200]   to go through and open up the Omnifocus app. It has text, expanded support as well, which is
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:47.680]   something I love on an application if it's on the iPhone or iPad. So you can put your text,
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.400]   expand your abbreviations in there as well, but a really nice, well thought out, nicely featured
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.840]   application and that's drafts. It also integrates with a thing called terminology,
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.560]   which is another application by the same people that enable you to, it's sort of like the dictionary
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.480]   on steroids, you know, you can sort of do much more and the integration is built in. I think
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.800]   there's some more integration with some other apps as well in there.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.760]   Yeah, it looks like they've got Fast sending to not only the native Twitter app at Tweetbot as well,
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:16.560]   which is the Twitter app of my choice. Terminology is a great app. We've talked about that on iPad
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.640]   today before, so it's nice to see this team has got another hit on their hands because
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:26.560]   their terminology is great. Very good. So that is drafts and a serret you have a
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:32.480]   I do and I hope you guys haven't talked about this in the past, but if you have, I'm just going to
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:37.280]   remind you why it's a cool app is Google catalogs. Have we talked about it, but I don't think
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.880]   we know it picked it. Okay, good. Google catalogs is it well, it's exactly what it sounds like.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:48.960]   It's actually Google's way for you to see if you can make sure I get this. I'm doing this backwards.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.080]   There we go. Something like you get the idea. Okay, let's go to featured catalogs. I've actually
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:00.560]   been looking at Creighton Braille before. So these are featured catalogs works in both landscape
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.120]   and portrait mode, which is already a plus. I mean, it isn't native iPad app. And what's nice
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:10.080]   about this is you go, well, catalogs isn't that sort of the yester year of shopping,
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:15.360]   but not always. Actually, sometimes I really prefer the catalog view of something,
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:20.960]   especially when, for example, right now I'm looking to buy a new chair in my living room.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:26.080]   And it's like, I don't know what kind of chair I want. I just want to see a setup of someone else's
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.600]   living room, which catalogs, of course, are very good at doing. Well, and especially now that now
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.520]   that you're getting on your iPad, instead of having delivered to your house, the carbon footprint
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:38.720]   impacts way down because you're not driving to the store and you are still getting all the
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:43.520]   information. Exactly. And depending on the catalog, so if we go back to, if we go actually back to
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:48.240]   Creighton Braille, because this one works really well, if you open up, it actually works a little
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.640]   bit better when it looks more like a catalog, if you open up a scene, let's say, you know, I was
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:57.760]   some rich person and I could make my backyard look like this. And I love, and I love this chair,
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:04.000]   this ottoman, you see a little tag. And once you click the tag, it'll open up in, in your browser,
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.640]   basically, it's a modified browser version of this exact ottoman gives you more information,
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:13.920]   then I can go ahead and buy on the website street from here. So again, I think a lot of people say
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.680]   with catalogs, I mean, that's a stupid stuff I get in the mail from the previous tenant in my
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.240]   apartment and who is really looking at catalogs all that often. But I think if you're in the market
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.520]   for something specific and you don't necessarily want to do a lot of online shopping, this is a
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.960]   good way to browse through stuff and get a little, get a little bit more motivation. I actually found,
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:39.360]   and let's go to collages. I'm in the market right now for some new speakers, gosh, it's all I talk
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:44.640]   about and I'm very overwhelmed, it's hard to decide to choose. And there's actually this really cool
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:51.440]   Crutchfield collage that Google Catalogs has put together that just gives me a bunch of information
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:59.200]   that experts have written up recently on audio equipment. Stereo receivers, bookshelf speakers.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.000]   High quality crossroads. Yeah, what's this Twitter made of, this kind of thing? And it's actually
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.920]   really helpful. So I love this app, it's completely free. And if you're sort of into window shopping,
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.280]   I guess is a good way to put it, it's a must-have for the iPad, and you might end up finding something
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:20.400]   that you end up wanting to buy as well. When I can't wait until the next generation where they
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.400]   start adding like rotatable, you know, to rotate stuff, videos, and I mean, you know that that's
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:30.400]   coming with a lot of the development. Some apps are kind of already experimenting with that.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   We're playing around with it a lot for our training stuff. So the iBooks author stuff,
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.160]   and you just know that catalogs are going to be probably bigger than schools in a lot of ways,
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:43.120]   because now you can add all this video and you can add all the, you know, the little rotating stuff.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.440]   Well, it's, you think of it as like books or ebooks. Well, you know, the books are going away,
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.720]   but it's not the reading that's going away. It's just the medium that's going away. And I think
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:58.240]   catalogs really do serve a purpose for inspiration, but I don't need them to be mailed to my house.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:04.800]   I don't want to pick them up at the cash register anymore, but I like to have the visual stimuli
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.720]   of the catalog. I saw a lot of people at NAB last week saying, "No, I don't want any paper."
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.160]   Yes, that's me. You were trying to handle something like, "No, I really," and I've noticed that I
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.200]   used to come back with this huge bag that would then sit in my, because I brought this huge bag
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.480]   back that was all the information of things I have to look at. And then it sat in the corner of my
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:26.160]   office until the next NAB, and I realized, "Hey, I haven't looked at this for a year, and I throw
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.640]   it away, and then do it again." And now that's all going away with stuff like this. So anyway,
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:36.480]   my pick of the week is, so I've tested. I just want everyone to know that I've gone through
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:42.160]   the trials and tribulations of testing just about every stylus for an iPad.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.160]   Have you done any tests for that for iPad today?
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:56.880]   Leo has his favorite. Although I know that the Verge, the Verge.com recently did a big stylus
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.800]   roundup. And I think that the one that they like the most is the same one that you like the most,
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:06.320]   but I will let you tell people about it. So I finally, after testing them all, there was one
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:12.960]   that I hadn't tested. And when I was at NAB, they had it sitting there. And I had to give it a shot.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.880]   And it is definitely the best. And then I bought one, and then I wanted my producer's
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.240]   hat actually, but it didn't stay with me very long. But it is a bamboo stylus from Wacom.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:31.680]   So Wacom is the, of course, they've been making these tablets forever. They think about these
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:32.240]   things a lot.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.200]   And she's standard for artists who are in Photoshop and using it regularly.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.920]   And I've been using their tablets forever. I have the bamboo tablet, and I have an
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.720]   Intuos, and I have a Cintiq, and I have a bunch of other things. And you just, you know, it's a
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.120]   great interface to kind of go in and out of it. And I just hadn't been, hadn't gotten around to
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.640]   this one. I literally have, I think, every other one. Like every other one now I see. And I go,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:59.440]   oh, yeah, I already have that one. And this one is by far, in my opinion, the weight,
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.760]   the interactivity with the iPad. I don't know what they're doing differently. I don't know what
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.320]   magic sauce they put on the tip. But it just feels great. And especially when you're using
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:15.840]   their bamboo paper that they have, you know, the bamboo notebook application, or paper,
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:21.120]   which is the other, my other favorite little drawing out. It just, it's very, very fluid. And so,
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:27.120]   so anyway, my suggestion is, my tip is the bamboo stylus. If you're looking for that perfect,
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.320]   you know, interface, you know, to your iPad.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.680]   Well, there was the, there was the app recently called Paper.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.720]   Yeah, sort of just, that's, that's my other one that I love it.
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:42.720]   So, and it's certainly not the first app that makes use of more of a free hand type of a thing.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.520]   So, Wacom makes their own tablet that does that. But there are certain ones that really
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.080]   figured out. Sketchbook is free on the iPad that you'll get a free version. And so,
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.640]   and you can do it with your finger, but it really makes a difference when you start to,
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.160]   yeah, when you start to use the stylus.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.480]   I think even for people who say, well, you know, I really don't do a lot of sketching or,
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.240]   you know, doodling or that sort of thing. Imagine if you had a stylus, even if you didn't use it
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.520]   on a regular basis, the other day, I had to sign a PDF document. And the iPad is like way easier to
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.480]   do that with than even anything in OS 10, in my opinion. And that would have been nice,
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:26.160]   because my, my signature is sort of fat finger type of a version. So, it does come in handy for
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:29.760]   all sorts of stuff. And, and having a good stylus is really where this, it moves to,
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.560]   you're, you really stop using paper. Like you just open up the notebook or you open up whatever
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.680]   we're going to do and start writing notes and starting making lists and, and that type of thing.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.640]   So I think that it's a, anyway, so it's pretty nifty bamboo stylus whack them.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.000]   And I think we're running to the end of the show Don, where can people find you?
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:52.720]   Right. We can find me over at screencastonland.com. That's where I do my weekly iOS and Mac video
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.600]   tutorials. I can find my apps on the app store, just search for SEO tutor. I've got four of them

[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:20.480]   And this week I was lucky enough to be able to have a seat here on Mac break weekly because
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.360]   the other port is out of town. It's nice to be here. I love Mac break weekly. I'm usually just a
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.360]   listener, but I love the content that you guys talk about. So it's fun. It's fun to join you guys
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.480]   every so often. So thanks for having me. Thanks. Thanks Don.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:37.520]   Thank you. No, it's been great. And I apologize. I missed last time was at a conference. So I was
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:42.240]   all lined up to, to, to come on to the show and the bandwidth, the bandwidth let me down.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.800]   Fine. So at last I managed to get, but you invited me back. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.440]   Of course we're going to invite you back in. Great. So, so thanks so much. And until next week,
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:59.200]   get back to work. Break time is over.
