[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.240]   that covers the latest Apple news.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.960]   In this case, live from CES 2012, where there is no Apple news.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.640]   Somebody made a very big mistake here.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.200]   Good news.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.280]   We've got a great panel.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.440]   I'm going to start all the way to the left with Leander Connie
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.080]   from cultofmac.com.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.720]   Leander, great to see you.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.720]   Why do you come to CES?
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.240]   There's no Apple news here.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.200]   Oh, I picked a different.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.360]   Apple's not here, but everybody else has got Apple products.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.120]   All right.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.480]   Alex Lindsey has actually brought some products,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.400]   to affect some fun stuff to play with, including
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.960]   a Thunderbolt drive.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.680]   I like drives.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.920]   Alex Lindsey from Pixelcore.com and Pixelcore.tv.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.320]   Sarah Lane is also here from iPad today and Tech News today.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320]   Hi, Sarah.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.120]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.960]   We're going to do iPad today here.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.000]   On Thursday.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.160]   We're going to walk the eye lounge.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.080]   28,000 square feet of iPod cases.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   Yeah, it's a lot bigger than last year.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.520]   That's huge.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.280]   But there's more than just iPod cases.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.920]   Thank goodness.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.040]   I hope so.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   Also here from cultofmac.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.840]   Erfan Elijah, it's good to see you.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   Nice to see you again.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   I don't know if you've been on the show before,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.600]   but have we met in person, I don't think.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760]   We have met in person.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.080]   We danced together out, South by Southwest.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.920]   I got photos of it.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   That was so much fun.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.160]   Apparently, I didn't do a good job.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.560]   I think you were a little--
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.600]   We danced together?
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.080]   We actually went like this.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   Really?
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.240]   Yeah, I have pictures of it.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.280]   I'd love to send those to you.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.760]   Please.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.200]   Just put them off in there.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.640]   Send this Sarah.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.160]   She'll use them.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.640]   Public Flickr set, please.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.200]   OK, I'll do that.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.240]   So we can all enjoy it.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.560]   So Leander, why is this a good show for an Apple blog
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.160]   like Cultofmac?
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   Although, by the way, you're branching out with Cultofmac.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.880]   Right.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.400]   More than Mac, baby.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.120]   Right.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120]   Android now, too.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.520]   CultofAndroid.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.600]   Right.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.120]   Are you going to shave Android into the back of your head
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.920]   with a little robot?
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.200]   Unfortunately, I don't have enough hands.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   Too late, huh?
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   Too late now.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.120]   Maybe I'll stick it on.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.840]   Do the Apple fanboys say, oh, you've--
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.200]   you're a pasta steak now?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.000]   You know, we are running a risk of alienating.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.760]   I hate to say a small part of our audience,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.640]   probably a big part of our audience with doing this.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.200]   But we were getting these debates.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   So every time we talked about Android in a news story,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.600]   there would be--
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.840]   we'd get a lot of Android fans coming in and debating
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   this stuff on Cultofmac.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.440]   So it made total sense.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.680]   It was just like the old days of the Windows versus Mac PC
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.880]   wall.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.240]   It is exactly like that.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.360]   For anybody who lived through that.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   Right.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.320]   It's reducks.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.520]   It's exactly the same stuff again.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.320]   And it's a very, very--
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.880]   Even down a market share and all of this stuff.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.400]   Right.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.120]   Well, Apple has huge market share right now.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.960]   But at some point, I think Android's
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.000]   going to become the Windows.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.840]   And they did buy the same sort of stuff,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.760]   like availability of software, which one's a better platform,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.520]   which one does this better, which one does that better?
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   Cool.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.600]   Is that CultofAndroid.com?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.440]   CultofAndroid.com.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.800]   Well done.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   I think that's great.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.160]   And I know Mike Elgin is writing for you.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.720]   In fact, he has the article why Apple will dominate CES.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.960]   And it has been true every year the last--
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.920]   since the iPhone came out, since 2007.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.920]   Last year, everybody was talking about iPad 2,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.080]   the year before iPad, the year before the iPhone.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.520]   I think this is the first year that it doesn't dominate.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.560]   Now, it's early days.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   We've been-- the show's been going on for two and a half hours.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.160]   So it might be too early to tell.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.920]   But I see a lot of Microsoft, a lot of Windows phone,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   a lot of Android.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.680]   True.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.640]   True enough, exactly.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.240]   I know Microsoft has really come back this year.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.800]   It's ironic.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.720]   This is their year.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.840]   Their last year.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.640]   But they're here.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.840]   Going out with the bang.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.480]   Very interesting.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   I think that I think that while Apple's not here,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.440]   and while you're not seeing a lot of the new Apple products,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.160]   the one thing you-- almost every person, almost every article
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.840]   that I've seen, every time they talk about anything
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.680]   being added to the TV, they say, but we're not sure
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   how this will compare to the ITV.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   Apple isn't even here.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.560]   They haven't even announced it.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   They said they're not doing it.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.520]   There is no ITV, but it does--
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.400]   But every TV is going up against this mythical beast
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   that is unicorn.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.240]   But we've seen this unicorn so many times now.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.160]   We've seen it, oh, they're never going to build a phone,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.120]   oh, they're never going to do an iPad, oh, they're never
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   going to-- and so you hear this, and then it just
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.000]   starts to keep on picking up speed.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.160]   And it seems like a lot of--
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   When we're talking about--
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.840]   You're saying it feels like the drum beat for the iPad
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.920]   and the iPhone, so it's a pre-release.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.640]   It feels like it's a CES pre-release
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.760]   where you have manufacturers that
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.040]   are very concerned about how whatever Apple's going to do
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.360]   is going to affect their business.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.160]   They're trying to figure out ways to add interactivity, ways
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.520]   to add Google TV, ways to add other-- their own tools,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.400]   their connected PC.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.920]   Well, I mean, they should be doing that anyway,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.680]   whether or not there's ever an ITV coming down the pipe.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.440]   And there's probably not going to be one this year.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.920]   It's just-- I think it makes for a good article half the time.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.840]   Yeah, I just find it interesting how often you see it
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   getting brought out.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.200]   Erfan, have you seen that LG 55-inch OLED 4-millimeter thick
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.320]   display?
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.160]   I have not.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.000]   You haven't?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   No, I've been in a dark cave writing for days.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.160]   We're going to get you writers.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   Well, I know Sarasau-- because it was at that event
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   that I wasn't allowed into last night.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.040]   Not that he's bitter.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.560]   I'm a good little experience.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.160]   I wasn't going to say the name, but yeah.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.200]   So and I saw it as we walked in the show, Flora.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.320]   We took a look at it actually on their live feed.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.560]   The rumor is-- and I'd love for the Kultimak guys,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.960]   because I know you hear all the rumors--
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.000]   that since LG already makes Apple's panels,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.480]   maybe this, which is not LG television,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   but LG's panel division, maybe this
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.440]   is intended for an Apple TV.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.080]   Sounds plausible.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.920]   Does it?
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.240]   Does it sound sensible?
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.680]   The only issue, of course, would be cost.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.360]   Could Apple get away with the charging $5,000 to $8,000
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.640]   for an Apple TV?
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.880]   Oh, gosh.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.800]   Yeah, easily.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.600]   But you think so?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.280]   I do not.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   Well, initially--
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   Especially a lot of money.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.440]   --especially since LCDs are now down below $1,000
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.240]   at that size.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.640]   By the way, LG was not at the digital experience last night.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.000]   I thought that the Samsungs was.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.040]   The Samsungs was.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.880]   It wasn't the--
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.920]   Oh, they didn't have the only--
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.200]   Oh, I don't miss anything.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.720]   No.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.600]   Well, these guys have huge overcapacity of panels, right?
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.160]   So they're dirt, dirt cheap, and they're dying to get
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.040]   find a way to get rid of them--
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.360]   That's right.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.160]   --to shift them.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.760]   That's right.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.240]   The trouble is, I think, when you think about Apple,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.880]   is that they come out with a new iPhone every year.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.160]   They have a new iPad every year.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   They're in the hardware business,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.520]   and they're in the hardware upgrade business.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.240]   Every year, they have something better.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.000]   And how are they going to do that in the TV business?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.960]   I think that's going to be difficult for them to figure out
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.040]   how exactly do they get people to upgrade the hardware
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.280]   if they're going to use their traditional hardware business
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.680]   model.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.320]   It is true that the Apple community
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.640]   is willing to pay higher prices for their key.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.240]   We are.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.640]   But look at--
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.080]   But look, it's true.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.960]   But $10,000, $8,000, $5,000 for TV.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.320]   I would be very surprised if we saw anything more than two
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.800]   or 3,000.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   I totally agree.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.480]   It has to be a consumer product.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.720]   They won't necessarily charge a premium,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   because look at the iPad.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.680]   The iPad is actually probably was a really good deal.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.400]   When it came out, it was really shocking for all of them.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.440]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.000]   And even though Steve Jobs said we are not competing
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.880]   against netbooks, they really were competing against the low end
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.960]   low priced computer hardware.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.480]   And that's true in TV right now.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.080]   I mean, it's been such a bad year for HDTV manufacturers.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.360]   They've been dumping their panels, as I said,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.400]   for less than $1,000 for a 55-inch display.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.600]   And I think that I think people, if Apple decided
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.920]   to go down that path, I think that what they are going to bring
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.080]   is more applications.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.360]   They're not going to just bring video.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.760]   I think what-- you have people that
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.720]   are tired of the viruses of their little PCs,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.880]   and they're tired of--
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880]   or they don't want to buy it.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.640]   They realize all I'm using it for is web surfing and email.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.280]   And I just want to incorporate that with my TV
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   and not think about it anymore.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.200]   And I think the sale point, if Apple decided to go down that path,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   is that this isn't a TV.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.560]   This is how you communicate.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.360]   This is how you do all the other stuff along with your TV
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.160]   in that experience.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.760]   I totally agree.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.920]   One of the things that Steve Jobs had said before was
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.880]   the problem was getting people to buy this hardware,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.040]   right?
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.080]   Because they already had T-vos.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.360]   They were getting stuff from dish, right?
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.840]   They didn't need to buy it anymore hardware.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.520]   So if it comes built into the TV, then all of a sudden,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.880]   people are like, oh, Apple has a TV.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.200]   Oh, and it comes with all this extra functionality
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.080]   that I would have had to buy an Apple TV or some
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.160]   of the device to get.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.600]   So for me, it's like a natural choice.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.320]   And if they make it similar close to a nice high-end TV,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.520]   for me, it'd be a no-brainer.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.600]   And I think that that--
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.240]   and there's ways they could make components that
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.960]   are interchangeable.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.240]   I know it's not exactly that way.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.520]   It's something that can pop in and pop out
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   so they can change the price.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.320]   Well, see, that's why I wonder why you even bother with a panel.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.560]   You've got an Apple TV that can do all those things.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.960]   Now, I have to say, Apple is felt here in a non-explicit way
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.840]   because every TV manufacturer is showing TVs
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.040]   with built-in apps at the show.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.840]   Yeah, smart.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.520]   It's still really, really hard to use.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.400]   These smart TVs?
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.760]   I was looking at the LG.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.880]   Now, I only went by Curse early.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   But in fact, we showed everybody,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.840]   if you watched our live stream at the beginning of the day,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.680]   the LG TV with Google TV--
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.200]   was it LG?
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.680]   Yeah, with Google TV built-in, it was an ice cream sandwich.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   They had a remote that I thought was decent,
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.040]   but then they also were showing you
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.200]   a phone and tablet interface.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.520]   Android, not iPhone.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.400]   Well, not makes sense.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.640]   And I thought that it was actually pretty clear, pretty easy
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.240]   to use, certainly no worse than an Apple TV with big icons.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.360]   Alex, why do you think that so many apps are so hard to use
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.760]   in a TV interface now?
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.440]   Because you don't-- I mean, going through it
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.120]   with the remote control, do that little whatever
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.760]   that they want you to do.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.280]   Now, it does make sense, exactly,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.480]   with the Google TV integration with an Android phone
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.040]   or whatever.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.240]   If you have an Android phone, that totally makes sense.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.120]   But I think that integrating our lifestyle
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.160]   with our little portable, whatever that is,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.360]   our iPad or Android, that makes it easier.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.960]   That makes it like-- because I don't lose this very often.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.520]   We lose-- my family loses the controller once a day.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.800]   Like once a day, we can't figure out
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.680]   how to get to the Apple TV or back away in the Apple TV.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.880]   That's why you need gesture-based--
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   Well, and the thing is, is that I think those are good.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.720]   But again, I think that the big thing here,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.480]   and I think that TV manufacturers want to stay the dumb panel,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.240]   but the issue is that I think that when I look at the way
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   my kids and the way my parents use their computers,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.680]   they don't need anything more than a fully operational iOS
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.560]   on their TV.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.640]   And I still think that there is a big argument--
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.440]   the Apple TV is fine, but I think that there
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.480]   is a big argument for a camera that's going to do--
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.040]   it's going to connect solutions as well as the FaceTime.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.520]   And I do think that FaceTime blows up for families.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.920]   We do so much FaceTime now with my kids' grandparents.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.320]   Like, now that everybody's got an iPhone or an iPad
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.520]   or something, the ability to let them say, hey,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.560]   kids are doing this and taking little videos
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.120]   and letting them talk to them and everything else now
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.640]   that the kids are getting more interactive,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   that's a very compelling thing.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   And it's more compelling when it's in the living room.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.880]   And I think that that--
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.680]   I don't think we--
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.720]   but I do think it's the total computing experience.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.920]   It's getting rid of the computer.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.360]   And I think this is what Apple's doing.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.600]   They're getting rid of the computer for the average person
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.800]   across the board.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.960]   Even with their own line, they're slowly winding it down.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.560]   But I think that they're slowly just cutting off--
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.800]   instead of trying to beat Windows,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.000]   they're just creating a whole other game.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.680]   It's adding everything.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.760]   It's putting a big power down.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.680]   And they're very good at expanding their experiences,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:05.880]   right?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.160]   So they started with the iPod.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.880]   And that brought a lot of people to the Mac.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.040]   And then they had the iPhone.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.200]   And then all of a sudden, oh, hey, there's an iPad.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.240]   It's just like the iPhone.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.720]   I can already use this if I buy one.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.800]   And I think that's going to be a big selling point for the TV.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.440]   You get a TV.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.320]   And all of a sudden, you already know
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.680]   how to use it because it interacts so well with the devices
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.520]   you already own.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.840]   That's the Steve Jobs phrase.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.080]   You already know how to use it.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.200]   And that was key, wasn't it?
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.120]   And in fact, to the acceptance of the iPad,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.480]   was it was just a big iPhone.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.400]   And I think that's why.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.800]   It has sold so much better than competing Android devices.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.840]   We have some videos that you took on the show floor.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.120]   I know you, Alex, are going to be doing this.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.280]   Do you--
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:42.720]   Do we actually--
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.120]   No, we actually shot these ones--
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.960]   With a real camera?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.480]   Real camera.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:45.840]   So Lynn shot this.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.480]   Some of a gun.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.760]   How do you do that?
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.720]   I know it was crazy.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.440]   It was crazy.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.560]   So Lynn actually shot them.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.200]   And I ran around.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.360]   And I came ready.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.720]   But then I ended up--
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.000]   You know what?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.120]   I've been using my iPhone and doing
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.680]   audio boo, which is audio only.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.240]   And social cam for video.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.320]   And just blogging with audio and video.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.960]   It's kind of got me back to my roots
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.520]   when I was an unaligned, unaffiliated journalist
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.960]   trying to get a story.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.840]   It's remarkably refreshing that it's not--
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.360]   Because you've seen even with this,
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.920]   you've seen me.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.760]   It's so simple.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.920]   I start rigging things up, though.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.720]   Yeah, you can't make anything simple.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.240]   Well, Alex has some goods.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.680]   He's got some video.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.280]   We've got a great panel, including from Cult of Mac.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.640]   We've got Erfan Elijah and Leander Conny.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.000]   Of course, Sarah Lane is here.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.600]   We'll talk also about--
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.200]   That is one way that Apple is absolutely here
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.080]   with the eye lounge.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.960]   We'll talk about some.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.160]   What we might be expecting in the eye lounge.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.000]   And a lot more.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.200]   Just a bit before we do, let me talk a little bit
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.080]   about our friends at Citrix who make go to my PC
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.800]   the easiest way to access your system from anywhere,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.520]   including, yes, your iPhone and your iPad.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.040]   Picture this.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.920]   You're on your way home after work.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.600]   You check your iPhone.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.960]   And you see an urgent request that
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.440]   needs immediate attention.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:02.960]   So what do you do?
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.640]   Go back, turn around, go back to work,
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.840]   and log on to your computer.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.000]   What if you had to go to my PC on the iPhone?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.080]   You could just pull over--
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.320]   notice I say that.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.160]   Because I know you guys aren't going to pull over.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.120]   You're going to be going like this while you're driving.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.760]   Don't do that.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.440]   Pull over, log in to go to my PC on your iPhone.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.360]   There's your computer--
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.600]   Windows or Mac.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   You can edit power points or keynotes, update spreadsheets,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.680]   work on any file right from your iPhone.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.080]   Of course, you've got an iPad app that's free as well.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.120]   And your desktop works as well, too.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.040]   Mac or PC, it's the fastest, easiest way
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.520]   to do remote access.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.760]   Absolutely secure.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.560]   Easy to set up.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.680]   You don't need help from the IT department.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.280]   In fact, if you could set it up right now while I'm talking,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.560]   before I'm done, you'd have it set up.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.760]   Just go to the website.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.760]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.840]   Click the Try it Free button.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.800]   Are you following along?
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.160]   And use my offer code Macbreak.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.560]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.400]   Try it Free button.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.760]   Offer code is Macbreak.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.200]   You could try it free for 30 days.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.440]   Use all this stuff.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.040]   Try that thing where you're driving home
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.480]   and you pull over and you use the iPhone.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   All that stuff.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.240]   Absolutely free.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.560]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.840]   The folks at Citrix do the best remote access software out there.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.680]   The fastest, the easiest to use.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.640]   And I did mention security, 128-bit SSL.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.040]   So you're always encrypted, always secure.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.200]   You can use it on an open Wi-Fi access hot spot
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.720]   like we were using right here and feel secure.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.240]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.920]   Use the offer code Macbreak.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.920]   So Alex Lindsey was out in the field.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   Was it-- Lanan was out there?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.120]   I mean--
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.360]   And so which one do we want to do?
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.800]   Or do we do them both?
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.520]   GoPro is here.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   I know I love these little GoPro cameras.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.720]   Let's take a look at the video that you guys
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.000]   shot at the GoPro.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.960]   Here at GoPro and that GoPro of course is--
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.400]   these guys are the ones that really created this.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.760]   So this whole little miniature camera, high quality video
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.200]   thing, this is really what started, I think,
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.440]   in a lot of ways by GoPro.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.000]   The craze has been started there.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.880]   And really what they make is this great durable camera.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.080]   Now this is just the guts of it.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.320]   You can get all kinds of plastic encasements
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.560]   that you can take underwater.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   You can connect them together.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.080]   In fact, you can sync up to 50 of these over Wi-Fi.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.760]   See this little back plate here?
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.360]   This little back plate here is going
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.920]   to be probably $99 coming out in a couple months.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.480]   This will control this GoPro and broadcast it via Wi-Fi.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.040]   But it'll also control up to 50 other GoPro's.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.880]   Now you can also sync them hardwired, truly sync them.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.080]   But you can get them all firing continuous or start
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.680]   all the videos.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.560]   If you're about to do your crazy, whatever jump
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.840]   or whatever you're planning to do,
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.760]   you can get them all started all at the same time
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.720]   with a little wrist controller.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.000]   So it's pretty nifty.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.680]   1080p, 30, 960, 48 frames a second,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.920]   and 720p at 60 frames a second.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.000]   So it's kind of a slick little guy.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.560]   And again, this doesn't look like a very durable case.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.520]   But once you start putting the plastic in,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.120]   you can see some of them over here.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.520]   So you can see there's a lot of little encasements here
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.680]   that you can put together.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.120]   It's also got an HDMI out, which you'll
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.680]   see in a bunch of them.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.520]   HDMI out means that you can get--
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.960]   if you wanted to hook these to some kind of mixing system
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.160]   or live stream system, you could do it with that.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.360]   You know what I like about it?
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.520]   They made no attempt to design anything at all attractive.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.040]   They basically said, what's the smallest space
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.440]   we could put all that electronics in?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.920]   OK, now wrap a box around it.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.880]   And one of the things that I like--
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.440]   Which is fine.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.920]   I mean, it does what it does.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.280]   We have a bunch of GoPros.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.960]   And one of the things that we like to use them for
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.240]   is just like little witness cameras.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.360]   So we know where people are and what things are doing.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.800]   And it's great because you have this little live output.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.120]   We don't even record with them.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.880]   We just like live webcams.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.200]   Yeah, we just use them as live webcams.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.440]   We call them witness cameras.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   Oh, yeah, that's a little weird.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:41.960]   What?
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.720]   Witness cameras.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.960]   We know where you were.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.360]   That's a little weird.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.080]   The witness camera is just that we put them at an event.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.920]   We put them where we know the speakers are going to be
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.320]   or where they're going to--
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.640]   So we can see them walking up.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   So we can see them walking up.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.480]   You know, we have been using it right now.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.640]   I don't know where it is.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.280]   The Dropcam?
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.840]   The Dropcam.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.240]   There it is.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.080]   Oh, it's up there.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.680]   And they're here-- in fact, we're going to get a new Dropcam.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.040]   They've been using-- they've been licensing accesses cameras,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.360]   which are Wi-Fi enabled cameras.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.280]   Access makes good cameras.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.280]   Is that the Dropcam shot?
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.800]   No.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.360]   You could see it.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.160]   Oh, there it is.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.680]   Right there on the right of the shot.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.520]   Wow, you guys are good.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.920]   They've got a new Dropcam HD.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.240]   They dropped off last night.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.560]   It's great.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.480]   They're going to outfit the new brick house with Dropcam HDs
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.880]   on every corner.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.400]   Oh, you'll be happy about that.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.000]   No, I don't mind the Dropcams.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.200]   It's just that the audio is so good.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.240]   That's why I said it.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.080]   I said it finally said they can hear what I'm saying.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   Well, the camera moves up the door.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   No, you're right.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   Because that's your desk.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   That's your office.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   That's your private time.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   And for-- if you have a camera over your shoulder--
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   One day, I'm just saying, my thank you for--
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   OMG, you're so cute when you do that.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.080]   You're the thing with your nose.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   I would never say that.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   Ever.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   Hey, MG wrote an-- MG Seagler Paris Lemons blog.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   He hates Android.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.880]   Wrote a very interesting blog post, which I could not disagree with, actually.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.080]   At first, I thought, oh, you--
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   Did he try?
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   I tried.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   I tried.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   And here we go again.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.080]   Apple fanboy going to-- I hate Android, just because it's not an iPhone.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   And you know what?
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   He made a really very cogent good case, I thought.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   Yeah, you have to get through the article.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   You do have to read the--
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.080]   Trump Trump said this morning, why does MG hate Android?
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   I said he made extremely clear points.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   You just have to read the whole article.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   His complaint really was that he was prepared to love Android, that Google had an opportunity
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.880]   to truly do an open phone that wasn't beholden to the carriers, and instead because the
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   Google Nexus 1 didn't sell carriers, basically killed it by not adopting it.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   And they had a relationship with Verizon?
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   Eventually, Google said, oh, screw it.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   We're going to have to get in bed with Verizon.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:51.880]   They did that horrible deal, which at the time we all agreed was a terrible betrayal to net neutrality.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:58.480]   Did that kind of joint paper with Verizon that eventually did, in fact, change net neutrality
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.880]   rules for the worst because they wanted to be in bed with them.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.880]   It was a business decision.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   It was not a political decision or a decision about open.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   And I completely agree with MG that that really was a betrayal on Google's part.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   And even if you love Android phones, to think of them as the good guys in favor of open systems
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.880]   is probably not any longer true.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Now, he might be going a little far when he says Apple's fighting for us.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.880]   And he does point out that Apple can stick it, unlike any other company, can stick it to the
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   carriers and has-- I don't know if they're really fighting for us.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   I feel like Apple's just like we're not going to answer to a carrier.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.880]   It's not so much that they're the voice of the people.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   Not to protect us.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   This is good business.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   It's just good business.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   Well, and the thing that Apple is doing is slowly getting rid of the carrier.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   When you look at your iMessage, when you look at your--
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.880]   But there's no frontal assault.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.880]   They just keep on sliding a little bit.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.880]   That's their way.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   That's the Apple way.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   It's sneaking under the radar.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.880]   They did it with the music industry.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.880]   Steve Jobs said, oh, you know, sell those 99 Santa la carte singles.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.880]   And the music industry said, oh, it's just a little Apple.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.880]   It couldn't hurt us.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   Couldn't possibly be a problem.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.880]   Oh, what's that?
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   Who's going to buy records on iTunes?
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   And I think they're doing the same exact thing.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   And you look at like the-- I now, when I'm sending images, I resist sending images when
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   I'm overseas to anyone I don't iMessage.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   Yeah, because it completely disintermediates the carrier.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   No longer you pay those expensive SMS fees, you're using your Wi-Fi or 3G, right?
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   When I'm on overseas, I will not--
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.880]   Does it use 3G?
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.880]   Yeah, use 3G.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.880]   And so it's just your data or if I'm--
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   So if I'm on--
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   If I'm overseas, which I am a lot, I will not send you a text message or an image or anything
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   else if I don't see the iMessage.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   Like, I just-- like, you're out of communication otherwise it's going to cost you a lot of money.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   Why do I have 200 of them a month or whatever overseas?
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   And so I'm like, I use this--
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   I use this in an Apple and S-Dye message.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   I wish shocked that the carriers would let them do that.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   Because they can't get on the choice.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880]   I don't think they had a choice.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   And what was the next thing AT&T did?
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.880]   Oh, hey.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   We realized that you guys don't really want smaller text message packages.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   Those are inconvenient for you.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   So we're going to go ahead and just get rid of those.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   Just pay off the $20 a month for the unlimited package.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   Then you'll be fine.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   Then you won't mind.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.880]   Plus data capping too.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   I mean, you know, the data cap's now really draconian.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.880]   I mean, it's almost impossible to do anything on the lower packages.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.880]   You know, the two gigabytes a month.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.880]   We run out of that in like a week.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   And I'm still waiting to see when Apple will finally just pull the trigger and let you call
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   another iPhone over Wi-Fi over data.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   Just call-- just like, you know, like, that's a good point.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   Instead of FaceTime and just make a call.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   With FaceTime, they have prohibited you from using 3G.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   That was a concession to the carriers, wasn't it?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   So they do pay attention to what the carriers want.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   If they really didn't like the carriers, we'd be all making 3G and Wi-Fi calls on FaceTime.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   And then we'd really be screwing the carriers.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   I mean, what are they going to turn that on?
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   There's no technical reason.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   Well, they're kind of the term for it.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   They're just dumb data plates.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   They're just dumb data plates.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   A lot of dropped FaceTime sessions.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   Because of 3G?
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   Yeah, it's already--
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.880]   But what I don't understand is why-- I mean, I do understand it.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   But what I'm waiting for--
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   I do it on 3G Skype, driving down the road.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   With video and everything, I clipped the camera.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   Sounds safe driving.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   Talk about unsafe.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.880]   So I'm driving.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   I was-- it was to Rick Salmon is a great photographer and he wanted to talk and I was on the road.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   I said, "Well, let's do this."
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   And I'm looking at Rick while I'm driving.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   And he's looking at me.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   And then we did drop the call.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   And Rick called me back immediately.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   He said, "Did you have an accident?"
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   I said, "No, no.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   We just dropped the call."
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.880]   But the thing is, if you went to voice--
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   And then, by the way, super cool.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   Maybe that's why Apple doesn't do it because people would be FaceTiming while they're driving.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   It was really, really cool to drive down the road.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   And he's seeing the road go by me as we talk on the phone.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   I thought that was neat.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   We were at the little monkey park in the Nanaaka, which is about three hours of trains out of Tokyo
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   in the middle of the mountains, about as far away from Tokyo.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   This is where the snow monkeys are, right?
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   Where the snow monkeys are.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   I'm FaceTiming with my son in Freeport, Pennsylvania.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880]   And my daughter was with me.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   And so we had a little MIFI, like a Japanese version of the MIFI.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   And so we're sitting there like, "I'm talking to them FaceTiming."
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   I was showing my kids in Petaluma, the monkeys live, and we're sitting there talking about it.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   And that was-- and the great thing is that was free.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   I mean, it was the MIFI or whatever.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   And the issue is that I think Apple obviously could use 3G for voice.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   I think, you know, just a matter of time before Apple just flips that switch.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   And then because then suddenly all your iPod touches and all your, you know, everything just becomes phones.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   As long as you're near a Wi-Fi, a Wi-Fi, which is becoming almost ubiquitous.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.880]   Let me ask you guys, maybe you can help one of our chatters, K.S. Kryptonian,
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.880]   said his problem with iMessage is my wife and I share an Apple ID on two different phones.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   She's getting my messages, I'm getting her messages.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   It's Apple ID specific.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   Now, you know why people want to share Apple IDs?
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   They don't want to buy songs and apps that say twice.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   I think you can send it to a number.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   I mean, I think that when I'm iMessageing, it's-- I don't know.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   I just-- I never share an iMessage.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   I guess I never share. That's fine.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   I don't either because it creates a lot headache.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   And what people don't realize is that you can-- you don't need to have the same Apple ID to share stuff.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   You can authorize apps, music on up to five computers still, right?
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.880]   So you just--
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.880]   You still need to log in.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   You need to log into that computer.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.880]   Well, the most important thing to remember is you don't have to log into a single Apple ID on the phone.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   Your iTunes store and your app store can be logged into one ID and iMessage and iCloud can be a different ID.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   Sure, yeah, because every once in a while I'll get an iMessage from like a Yahoo mail account.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   Right.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   What is this?
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   You don't realize, oh, they just associated that for whatever reasons.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   So it shouldn't be--
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.880]   I wonder where the setting would be.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   You shouldn't be constrained to just assemble us.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   I would say that is one of the weaknesses in my opinion.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.880]   A lot of the Apple-- the way the Apple system works is that it really is a one user environment.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.880]   And it got worse when they went to the iCloud from the-- because when you had--
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   No, I can't even remember what it was called.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   No, you can't.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   You could put an email address in here.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   Yeah, so you can.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   When you go into your settings and then you go down to Messages, you have an option to receive at.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.880]   I have two addresses set up to receive an email plus my phone number.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.880]   So yeah, you can just--
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   Brent, you could show that I think on here.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   But this is the part of the show where I give away personal information about myself.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   I'm glad you did.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.880]   I know.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   Is that your social security number on there?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   I always-- like, only always grabs my iPhone.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   I'm like, "Oh, I don't know if I was out for that."
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   You can zoom in because I'm covering the last four digits of my phone number.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   I think that's--
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   There you go.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   So you could set all of that.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.880]   And you don't have to use an Apple ID.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   I mean, I have it in there, but I could take it out.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   Cool.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   Can you do iMessage without an Apple ID?
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   Don't you?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   Well, I think so.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   I don't know.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   Well, I think you can use either a phone number or an email address.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   But it can be confusing because--
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   OK, I've signed out of my account and now I can only use a phone number.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.880]   Right.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   All of the features went away.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.880]   So I think you do have to have an Apple ID logged into-- even to be using other emails.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   So create a new Apple ID and use that.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   Let your wife use one, you use the other, and share it.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   But you could still sign into your iTunes store with this shared ID.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880]   I think.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   So KS Kryptonian-- and now he says, "But what about my iPad?"
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   Oh, screw you.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.880]   You can use your email address on your iPad.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   That's what I do.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   Right.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   And that was a problem with me for FaceTime is I couldn't use the same email address on multiple FaceTime devices.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.880]   It would say, "Oh, Leo, Leo was already used on your iPad."
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   I mean, it was like confusing to me.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   Like, I'd have a different address for every device.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   Well, it's because there are different phone numbers associated with that.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.880]   Right.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.880]   That's how it would call is by email address.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   So it wouldn't know what to ring.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   Right.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   OK.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   We have another video.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   Where else did you go?
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   So I only--
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   Oh, I only--
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   Oh, what's that?
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   No, no, no.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   All I did was look at cameras.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   I know this is an option.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   You know, PMA.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   This is to me.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   OK.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   Let me say this up front.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   This is probably going to be a smaller CES than last year.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   About 100 fewer exhibitors.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   I suspect there'll be fewer visitors here this year.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   But they did something very smart.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   They joined up with the Photo Marketers Association Show, which is the big camera show in the US.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.880]   And that added 500 camera manufacturers.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   Well, it made a lot of sense of PMA.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   Can't it was out here.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   Because you have all these people that are interested in what Toronto is there.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   There's that crossover PMA, to be honest with you, was kind of slow.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   I mean, I was like looking--
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   I don't know if I really want to go to P.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   No, no, no, no, not here.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   I think last year, yeah, it was slowing down.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   You're having problems.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   So this is a way of saving P.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   Absolutely.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   And I think it makes sense.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   Now I got-- yeah, I shot this last night, but it's another video camera.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   I was really focused on little miniature cameras.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   So let's take a look.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   This is the contour.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.880]   And contour.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   Now contour makes another one of those kind of action-adventure cameras.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   So what you have here is you've got a couple, three different versions here.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   This is your basic contour.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   Now what this is really set up for is you've got kind of a modular setup.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   You've got your quarter 20 connection that all your cameras have.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   But there's a lot of things that you can slide onto it.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.880]   So you've got all kinds of little pieces that you can kind of slide on to attach them to your--
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   you can see all these little pieces here.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   But you're going to attach them to your helmet.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   You're going to attach them to your arms.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   You're going to attach them to all kinds of pieces.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   So they have it here.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   Now one of the things is you don't have to worry about the button.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   You slide it forward and it starts recording.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   You can rotate this.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   So you can rotate this.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   So if you get it onto your helmet and you notice that it's a little cock-eyed, you can kind of turn it and actually get it just right.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.880]   So it's kind of slick.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   Now this is the lowest end one.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   This is 199.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   This is the most basic version of the process.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   You also have one here.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   Now this one is a GPS.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   So if you had this, if you were wearing it and you had kind of a hang--
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   hangover kind of experiencing it, we are in Vegas, this would have solved.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   The hangover would have ended up being like two hours because you would have known, I mean,
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   two hours of the day and only a 10-minute movie because they would have known where they went.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   Because this has GPS all applied into the video and you can turn it on and off.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.880]   And that's all the basic stuff here.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   Now this one starts to turn it up.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   Now this is 299.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   This is 499.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   Now what you get for 499 is you have your USB.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   But you also have an HDMI live output.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   You can also attach a microphone.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   So this is a little 8-inch jack that you can put into there.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   And of course you can rotate this up to 270 degrees to organize it.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   Now the other thing that you can do is actually have this project out via Wi-Fi to your mobile device.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   So you can actually have these two here.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   We'll put it out to Wi-Fi.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   You can actually see it on your iPad, your iPhone and your Android through one of their applications.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   And so there's a lot of ways for you to kind of look at what you're actually shooting, make your adjustments
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.880]   and be ready to roll, hit record and you're off to the races.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   So anyway, so that's contour, slightly different version.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   170 degrees, 135 degrees of field of view.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   So slightly different as far as that.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   Are you wearing beads?
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   They gave us beads.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   I never got any beads.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   I can see why they didn't let me into PepCon.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   That thing was wall to wall people.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   You couldn't hardly move.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   There was nobody there!
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   There were plenty of people there.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   It was just a very large space.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   Were you there late at night?
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   Yeah, I shot everything right at the end.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   I just wanted to round and looked at everything.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   So some of these cameras now are awesome but very much aimed at adventure sports.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   Well that's the big market for these little cameras.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   A lot of the market is.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   You don't really want to take a video of you doing shopping.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   No, I certainly don't want to wear a helmet either.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   Well and there's also a certain level of, I mean there's lots of little cameras.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   Where the same lenses go are like camera phones.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   If you're not doing adventure sports, what a lot of these are specializing in is that I'm going to do something rugged
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   and that's what specializes them and what sets them apart from just having a camera phone.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   It's the same quality of chip really.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   It might even be the same chip.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   But what they're really doing is how do I make it easier to be on the road?
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   Exactly.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   I want to see some still cameras though.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   Can you do that next week?
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   Yes.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   Next time.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   The D4 thing there will be anybody here.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   The D4.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   The D4.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   The D4.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   Oh, I drew a one with that thing last night.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   Uncompressed HDMI out with no interface.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   I thought that's what you'd like about it.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   That's all I have to say.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   So that was another thing I missed last night.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   I thought you're bitter.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   Not that I'm bitter.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   These guys are from Santa Rosa.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.880]   I want to show this, this is another kind of camera.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   Okay.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   We're going to take a little bit of a break.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   Is this another, is this, do you, is I use this shopping?
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   Or would I have to get, put a helmet on to wear the uses?
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.880]   No, you can use this in all kinds of fun other ways.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   Another witness camera coming up.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   Just a little bit.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   Actually Alex has some other things including, I want to take this home.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   I want this at my house.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   I thought that you couldn't get these anymore.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   But first, let's talk about backup.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   You know how important it is to backup.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   I hope you know how important it is to backup.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   You're backing up, right?
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   What?
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   Okay.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   Look, I know why people don't back up.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   They think they're backing up.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   I asked my dad, you back up.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   He said, oh yeah, I back up.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   I said, well, tell me about your backup.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   Whatever I think of it, I take a USB key and I copy some files to it.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   That is not what I would call a strategy.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   Because first of all, you don't think about it, right?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   You might back up once every six months.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   Just think about what's on your hard drive right now and how you would feel if the next
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   time you turn on your computer, it wasn't there.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   I'm not talking about your applications.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.880]   I'm not talking about Windows.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.880]   You can reinstall those.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   I'm not talking about the OS X.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   I'm talking about your stuff, your pictures.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.880]   Pictures of your baby, your wedding, travel plans, financial records, e-mails, all that stuff
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   that your hard drive is holding it.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   It's precious and you probably don't have enough to date backup.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   That's why carbonite.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.880]   So here's the deal with carbonite.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   It is unlimited backup for your internal drive.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   So perfect for a laptop.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   It does it whenever you're online.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.880]   It's using 128-bit SSL.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.880]   So once again, you don't have to worry if you're somewhere like here on an open access point.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.880]   People aren't seeing your data.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   It's all encrypted.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   You could further encrypt it if you want total privacy, by the way.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   It doesn't slow your system down.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   Mac or PC, yes it works great with Lion.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   Less than five bucks a year, a month rather, for all the data on your internal drive.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   That's a good deal.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   $59 a year.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.880]   Now they do have other plans.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   The $59 a year plan is for everything on your internal drive.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.880]   You want to backup all these big external drives we have.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   They have a plan for that.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   If you have multiple computers, they have a plan for that.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   But in every case, you can go to carbonite.com and try it free for two weeks.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   So you get a sense of how it works on your system.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   And then if you decide to buy, use the offer code MAC break and you'll get two months free,
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   14 months for the price of 12.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   So carbonite.com, use the offer code MAC break to try it free and use MAC break again if you decide to buy it again,
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   14 months for the price of 12.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   Carbonite, it's back up, done right.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   And if you're not doing it, maybe you better start right now.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   Carbonite.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   We don't want to panic you.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   Well, you're jumping out of a plane without a parachute.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   How can it be unlimited, it says, "Who finden?"
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   That's not possible.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   Well, that's why it's not like every drive you own.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880]   It's your internal drive.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.880]   You can't hook up one of these big suckers.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   What is this big sucker?
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.880]   So this is a, well, this is like an existing drive.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   But this is the big news with this.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   This is the LaCie.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   So this is the Thunderbolt.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.880]   Oh my God, we're seeing an actual Thunderbolt.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   It's actually one of the things that we're seeing a lot of now is people starting to show them.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   Now they're still coming out.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   So this is a one, this is a C gate.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   Then C gate makes these and C gate makes, so it's a dock.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   And I have these.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   This is actually the drive that I've been starting to use.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   So this is a drive that doesn't have a connector, a normal connector,
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   it has a docking connector.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.880]   And then you buy this additional add-on.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   Right.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.880]   And it docks into that with a docking connector.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.880]   And then this one's Thunderbolt.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   But you could presumably get USB or Firewall.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   So what I have, I have, the one that I have in my house is, you can have one, a dock that you can set by one dock.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   And then you have a bunch of little, you could have one drive in a bunch of different ways depending on,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   you can have docks that you can set next to your car.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   Multiple docks or multiple drives.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   And multiple connections.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   And instead of like plugging and unplugging and figuring out how you want to connect it.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.880]   Now the advantage, of course, is that this one has, of course, the Thunderbolt.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   Right.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   So this is going to, I love the Thunderbolt.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   And then this is, it's a Thunderbolt.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   So you can use that drive for an iPad or...
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   Well, what was the Firewire icon?
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   Was it a wire on fire?
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   No.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   I'm going to learn clearly on the concept.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.880]   Why would you want to have different connection options?
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   I'll tell you why, actually.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.880]   It's because the issue that we have is that we end up on a laptop.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   And now, like, works in a world that is unlike any other human.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   You want to transfer between two drives.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   And if they're both Firewire drives or both USB drives, it'll really be slow.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.880]   It'll really be slow to connect them to your laptop or something else.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.880]   And so being able to...
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   One Thunderbolt, one Fire.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   Or just all Thunderbolt now.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.880]   I mean, this, by the way, is a dock.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.880]   So this is...
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   Oh, that's a dock too.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   So they really, they're solving this issue by making...
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   Because nobody's ever going to buy this.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   So they're solving.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   But wait a minute.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.880]   They can't charge enough for that.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   How much they charge for the dock?
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   I think this is $189.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   Oh, shit.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   So the...
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   So, but that's licensing fees, right?
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   It's probably with all, like, 90 bucks of that.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   It's probably licensed.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   I don't know.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   But we'll say the other thing you're going to get is a lot more speed.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   So this is going to be three times faster than a Firewire 800.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   But the drive isn't.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   No, but no, no.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   The drive is capable of doing much faster than what it is.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   Yeah, the drive is typically even a 7200 RPM drive.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   Is faster than the Firewire?
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   Is faster than the Firewire is able to support.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.880]   And so what you're actually going to be able to get is a much faster connection than what you'd have with the Fire.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   The only way you get the same speed is Iseta.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   So if you had an Iseta connection, you really get full...
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   That's full three gigabit transfer.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   This is more than three gigabits, though.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   Ten gigabits, yeah.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.880]   And that's what you can...
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   Is that is only three, so...
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   So this is going to be a very fast connection.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   And you can daisy-chain them.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   So this is part of a flow.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   So you can have...
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   I really think that the big thing is is that you're able to have a bunch of drives all connected to one connection.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   And there's so much headroom in that connection that I can add.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.880]   I can have this drive, I can have another drive, I can have a capture device, I can have all these other things that are stacked up.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.880]   And I have one little cable.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880]   It's an expensive cable.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   But one little cable that plugs into my computer and attaches to all of this stuff.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   And then when I'm leaving with my laptop...
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.880]   That's a thunderbolt.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.880]   I'm off to the race.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.880]   Now, so this is passed through?
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   Is that the idea?
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   Yeah, I do.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   One in one out.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   One in one out.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   So you would...
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   What is the limit on Thunderbolt devices?
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   Six total.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   Six total.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   Does your monitor count as one?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   Yes.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   So if you use...
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   Most people use Thunderbolt at least right now just for their monitor.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   But if you have that connected, you could have five more devices.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   Right, and you could basically at home, you can daisy-chain those devices from your monitor.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   So you're running your Thunderbolt into your monitor.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.880]   Right.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   It's Thunderbolt.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.880]   And then put your drives and everything.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   Every Thunderbolt device has one in one out.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.880]   It's kind of like fireworks.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.880]   Yeah, it just lets it pass through.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   But the big thing is, is that when you passed it through before, whether like USB or Firewire,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   the whole chain has a maximum speed that it can run at.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.880]   The headroom on the Thunderbolt is so much higher that you're able to attach all these things
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.880]   and still get their full speed.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   And you have one little cable.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   So I get it.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   So 10 gigabits is more than any drive.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   But if you have five drives, now you're not maxing out.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   Like for instance, if you decided you really needed a lot of speed, you can take two external drives.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.880]   They were actually showing this at the Lassie booth to two external drives and make a RAID 0 out of them.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.880]   And you're getting like 500 megabytes a second.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.880]   So this is the first trade show we're really seeing lower end devices.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   I mean, that NAB show last year, we saw Blackmagic had a number of Thunderbolt devices.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   These are more consumer-friendly.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   Yeah, so you're seeing...
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   Although not cheap, 200 bucks for the dock alone.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   It's not going to be the cheapest solution at the beginning, especially because people are just getting started at it.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.880]   And what I'm excited is I was getting worried that we weren't going to see anything.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.880]   I mean, it was starting to look like... it was starting to get dark.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.880]   We had that conversation last week or the week before.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   I thought Thunderbolt might be D.O.A.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   But we're seeing a lot of commitment from Seagate, from Lassie, from... I think G-Rade is showing some stuff.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.880]   So there's a lot of people that are showing drives.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.880]   And I don't think this is going to be for everyone.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   If you're an average consumer, a USB drive is probably fine.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   The Firewire drive.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   But I think Firewire is probably... I think the laptops and the computers that have Firewire in them, this is the last year.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   Right.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   You know, I think that... and I feel bad about that.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   That makes me sad too, but I think that...
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   I probably still have some scuzzy drives lying around, don't you?
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   I'm using 3.5 inch discs for my backup plan.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.880]   Never, never give up.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   So anyway, so I think that it's...
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   I'm excited to see it kind of move forward in that process.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   This is a camera.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   This is like the Contour in the GoPro.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   I mean, what's happening is that these little tiny camera chipsets are out.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   And so people are thinking of all different new form factors.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.880]   What is this?
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   So this is an ego, and this is from...
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   Just pulled it out of the sh-
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   You're going to hold it?
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   I was going to turn it so you can see a little patch.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   Well, you can turn it, but just keep it right there, okay?
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   All right, so this is an ego.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   Oh, you should be on sets, all right.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   So this will capture 12 megapixel images.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   It also does up to 1080p at 30 and 60p at 720p.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.880]   It'll do Wi-Fi, so you can have your smartphone or tablet or computer.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   It has Wi-Fi built-in.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   Built-in, built-in.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   It's got a micro SD.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.880]   It comes with a 4 gigabit, but you can have a gigabyte, but you can have up to 32.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   It's got a...
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   It records and streams.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   And streams.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.880]   All of these record as well.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   And then it also has an HDMI and a USB to power it.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   But an HDMI...
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   The power is...
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.880]   So there's no battery in this thing, let's say.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   Well, no, you can have up to about an hour and a half, two hours internal battery.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   Wow.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   And that's just the charge.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   The USB is just the charge.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   I mean, and then it's got an HDMI out, so you can get HD streaming out of this.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   This could be...
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   This is also possibly another thing that you could use with a little bit of a conversion
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.880]   as a webcam, but you could definitely...
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   One of the things we want to play with is a miniature on-the-road switching kit.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   We can actually plug this camera or other cameras into them and then connect them to a little
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   switcher, and you have this thing you could fit in your backpack that you could do a three
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   or four camera shoot with.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   So anyway, it's pretty nifty.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   This is one of the least expensive ones too.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.880]   This is $149 MSRP.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   It looks waterproof.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   Is it waterproof?
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   I don't think it's waterproof.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.880]   I think it's water resistant.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.880]   I think it's water resistant.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   When you look at the way that...
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   It's rubber-rusted.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   It's cut.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.880]   These are sealed, but yeah, I think you probably wouldn't want to lie.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   You need to put it under.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   This is the distinction between resistant and proof.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   It's...
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   It's not a flash.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   What is that on there?
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.880]   I think that that's the interface.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.880]   I don't know why.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880]   Yeah, I think that...
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   I believe that that's the interface.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.880]   I think that if you push that on...
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.880]   Oh, it's like...
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   Is it a little...
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   It's like a type of interface you can kind of push stuff in and...
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.880]   It's a little LCD display.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   Yeah, so that you can...
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   So teensy.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   Just so you can get just the information that you need.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   So anyway, it's a pretty nifty little...
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.880]   You know, something you can throw in your pack.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   It's got a quarter-twenty on the bottom, so it's got your standard mount.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   So you can have a...
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   For instance, if you had one of those little Gorilla pods...
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880]   And you want to attach this.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   Right, I love it, because it says the mount.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   This also does, of course, it'll do interval shooting.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   So 12 megapixels of, you know, time-lapse.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   So you can take one of these and just attach it and let it run.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   There it is. It is on.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   Between the contour, the GoPro, and this...
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   They seem fairly comparable.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   It just depends on what you want to do.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   You know, the GoPro is going to be...
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   The GoPro is a little bit more expensive.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   It's a little bit more durable.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   And it's a little bit more scalable, but it costs more.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.880]   And it's also just slightly larger.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   If you like...
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   This is really cute.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.880]   It is really cute.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   It's really cute.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   This is the least expensive one.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   It still has your live outputs, your wide-frame.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   1080p.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   Yeah, and, yeah, 1080p.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.880]   And 60 frames a second at 720p.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.880]   This one's going to be the least expensive, the smallest one.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.880]   You can throw a bunch of them in your pack.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   It's going to be...
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.880]   And weight becomes important if you're trying to attach them for, like, time-lapse,
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.880]   or you're attaching them to something.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.880]   So the GoPro is on one end.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   I think if you're really looking for scale and stuff like that, it's on one end.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   Now, these guys also make goggles.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.880]   You know, they make the goggles that have the camera attached to it,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.880]   so you can be skiing or motoprocing with encapsuring stuff.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   That's what they really got known for.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   This is new for them.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.880]   Liquid image has mostly been doing, like, scuba masks, goggles.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   Oh, they were here last year with scuba masks with cameras.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   Yeah, so that's what they do.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   That's who these guys are.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   I remember them now.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.880]   That was the one.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   Remember guys, we had the Android Ed.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   That they had the mask on.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   And it turns out they're in Santa Rosa.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   So they're local people.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   They're going to have to come down and check our little studio.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   But how long before we're doing shows with cameras that's small?
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   I'm going to be doing one as soon as I get the cameras.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   I mean, these probably will soon get as good as the cameras we're using.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   Well, I think that the big thing is that we look at, you know,
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   we stream in a lot of different levels, you know, sometimes with big broadcast cameras.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.880]   But one of the things that I want is to be able to have something in a backpack or, you know,
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   or a fanny pack.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   That's my mixer with a bunch of little cameras that I can switch to,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   that I can take anywhere in the world and just kind of pop it up and have a little event.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   And I think these are the kind of cameras now that they're doing the live outputs.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   The older GoPros and a lot of the early ones didn't have that live HDMI output
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.880]   that these little guys do.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   So it's exciting.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   Have you gone over to see the 40 or the D4 rather?
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   I did.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:10.880]   The Nikon.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.880]   It's due to our fun.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.880]   It was high on my little camera.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   I'm a Canon user and I still was like, I literally, I had a conflict with my religion.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.880]   Like looking at it, I was, well, well, didn't Scott born do that?
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.880]   He sold all his Canon gear and moved to the Nikon.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   I think he might have.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   I can't remember what the, I can't remember what he's.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   No, he's a Nikon shooter because the advantage Nikon has for E-Shoots Birds is speed of focus
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.880]   and other frames of burst mode.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   And this new D4 is like, oh my God, it's like.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   Well, the Canon's actually faster.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   It takes pictures faster, but the D4 is, it's one of the best low light performance cameras.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   204 ISO.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   24,000.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:56.160]   It's so sensitive to light that they had to make the buttons on the back self illuminated
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.880]   so just so you could see what you were doing.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.880]   Because you could take pictures in that level.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   Yes.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.440]   And they solve something that Canon has, I don't understand why Canon hasn't fixed this, but
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.120]   Canon will not only compress the output of the, of the camera through the HDMI out, but
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.440]   it also puts the inner, there's no way to get rid of the whole interface on the, on the
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   camera.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.080]   But, but they, because they always, it was always built as like a preview tool and they
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.400]   just left it all in there and no matter how many of us complain about it, you know, they,
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.600]   they leave it in there.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.640]   What Nikon did is they now, A, you can record up to 30 minutes instead of 11 or 12 on the
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:36.040]   Canon and it's an uncompressed 8, 8 bit output that has no interface.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.720]   So you can hook it to a, to a key pro or, or some kind of external device.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.960]   It could be used as, as we use the cameras here.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   Exactly.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.680]   As a, as a studio camera or something.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.920]   It may or may not, that those big chips tend to overheat.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.600]   So you, you may not be able to use it like an ENG type thing where you have it on all
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.360]   day, but having, but for folks who are using it for interviews for, you know, that type
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.760]   of thing, which we use, that's why we have the 5Ds.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.800]   We don't, I, I mean, I use them for still as a fun project, but the reason that I own
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.600]   5Ds is just to do interviews.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.840]   Well, as we continue our CVS coverage over the next three days, four days, we will, I'm
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.120]   sure have some cameras combined.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   I'm sure that Nikon D4 will be one of my friends back.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.040]   Now this is something that I really wanted.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.240]   This was created by Fidel, the guy who did the iPod.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   Wasn't it John Fidel?
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   I can't remember his phone.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.600]   Tony, Tony Fidel, that's right.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.680]   And this is a new age thermostat, but I thought you couldn't get these.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.200]   These have been sold out, right?
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.800]   They were, we, we, we were borrowing one from the booth.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.280]   From there, I really want.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.480]   I, I, I, it is such a, it is such a smart thermostat that watches your usage.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   Click on it.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.160]   And then you get a whole interface.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.640]   Wow.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.200]   You can, and then with the schedule, you can sit there and, yeah, wow, that's slick.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.440]   And then you just, and then you click on it and then move, you can move it around.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.400]   You can go ahead and hit it one more time.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   Now move it around.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   Now you can, you can just roll it and you should, yeah, you can find the time.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.560]   They could do two hands.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.920]   I'm like ginger right.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.000]   And then, and then, and then click on it again and you can set the temperature.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Wow.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   It's a really nice interface.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   It's just, it's gorgeous.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.880]   It's the interface that you wish, you know, you just.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.880]   You wish everyone would do.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   Right.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.120]   This is kind of, but this is how you're competitive, I think, in the next generation of all electronics.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.120]   Right.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.120]   All devices, yeah.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.760]   And I think this is what Apple has really brought into the electronics field is we're
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.600]   not willing, you know, we're not going to take it anymore.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.400]   You're not going to take bad interfaces and horrible little buttons and, you know, we're
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.440]   expecting to have an LCD and, and something that's intuitive.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.520]   I picked this up last night at their booth and just started playing with it and immediately
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   understood how it worked.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.800]   Well, I still don't know how much I'm doing it backwards and I understand how it works.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   I just set the temperature.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.000]   Because it's, it's about the iPod, right?
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.400]   It's the same sort of click wheel idea.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:49.320]   But also with a bit of sort of the modern day app type, you know, very, very, there's
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.600]   actually a lot of information there that you can, you can change.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   I love the look of it.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:58.400]   I just, I want someone to have, oh, I don't know, three nests in their house for a few
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   months.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.240]   And then tell me how many times their dog triggered it to turn on to 80 degrees or something when
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.520]   they actually weren't home.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.440]   Because the whole idea is that it's, it recognizes motion and it also starts to know your habits.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.680]   But how do you make sure that it's not getting triggered for the wrong reasons?
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.680]   Right.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   You know, over a dozen.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.840]   I think you can override a lot of those.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.400]   You can override a lot of that.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.160]   You know, it definitely has a lot of that intelligence.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.720]   I, yeah, a lot of that stuff can be kind of, you can decide how much you, how much weight
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.720]   you want to give that.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.720]   Wow.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.800]   Now, the other issue is it's not cheap.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.120]   It's really expensive for thermostat.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.480]   You can, it goes on the wall.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.080]   You can, in most cases, replace the existing thermostat.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.760]   They have an app online that will tell you if your wiring is appropriate to put a nest.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.360]   And I believe you can interact with it with your iPhone as well.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.040]   So, so you can, so you have, I mean, I was just going to ask that.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   That's really cool.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.880]   Probably an iPad to adjust the temperature on your couch when you're watching a movie
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   or something.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.840]   It's like, it's like, it's a little golden here.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.440]   You know, and there's not a lot of going up and figuring out.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   I mean, I don't even bother.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.840]   I mean, I have some crazy Honeywell in my house and I don't understand.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.920]   Well, there's a lot of home automation stuff at the show here this year.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.120]   And this is what you're saying early.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.840]   You know, like a lot of it is compatible with iPads and iPhones and Androids too.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.920]   You know, that they're looking at the smartphone, you know, to be able to control almost everything
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   in your house.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   I was always really skeptical of the X11.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   Remember the old X11 days when, and clap, clap on clap off.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   X10.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   Yours went to 11.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   Okay.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   He's British.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   Wow.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   This is what 250 bucks?
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.920]   Yeah, 249.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   A little pricey.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   I just reset it.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   I hope you don't mind.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   That's fine.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   It's restarting back in a bit.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.520]   I like the thing that says back in a bit.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   It's kind of British.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   It's a British thermostat.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520]   Is Tony British?
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.520]   No, he's from the States.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.520]   I broke it.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.520]   It no longer turns on, but I guess it's sleep.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.520]   Johnny I.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.520]   Oh, you know, it might be running on a battery too.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.520]   We had it.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.920]   I had it designed to be plugged in, but it has an internal battery that's kind of an
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.800]   emergency battery and it may have just that is really neat.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.520]   I really, I want one of these badly.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.920]   So are you going to be able to get some?
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   You think, oh, it's rebooting.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   That's what happened.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.680]   A thermostat that repoots.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.200]   I'm definitely getting one for my, for my house.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   Very cool.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:17.640]   Hey, by the way, an Anttec is reporting that MSI is here at the show floor with a PC motherboard
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.600]   with Thunderbolt on it.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.280]   That would, that's the kind of thing we need to see more of.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.080]   I thought I saw that Lenovo had a Thunderbolt option.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.160]   I could have sworn that I saw some announcement that they were incorporating it, but I could
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.400]   be, you know, I mean, it's an Apple.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   It's an Intel standard.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.560]   So it's not like it's a foreign standard, but so was Firewire.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.760]   And I think it, well, the same as USB, USB was Intel and no one was using it until Apple
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   made it standard across the device.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   That's true.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.440]   Apple did too good a job and everybody uses USB now and nobody cared about it.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:48.080]   The same with airport as well with that was, um, or an OCO.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:54.280]   Well, the, the standard they chose, they chose Lucents, uh, on an OCO, what it was and then
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   that's why that became standard.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   Well, this is cool.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   It's doing something.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.280]   I don't know what it is.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.520]   It feels like a friendly, happy alien in my house.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.720]   It's just, it's just, yeah.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:09.760]   Lenovo announced Thunderbolt support for its 14 inch edge S 40 S 430 laptop.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   Wow.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   So good.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.280]   So the fact that you're starting to see PCs use Thunderbolt, I think it's very.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.600]   And I think a PC, PC manufacturers are going to be more risk adverse.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.800]   They're not going to add it until they see the components.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.240]   And so now we're seeing a lot of the components.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.440]   And I think that, that, then the computers are going to start falling.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.480]   I think Apple tends to lead the components and PCs tend to follow the company.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   It takes years, isn't it?
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.320]   For it to, for it to happen, for it to build up.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.840]   And it's probably why we're seeing the Thunderbolt now rather than a year ago.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.560]   It's because there wasn't enough Thunderbolt devices for them to connect to.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   So everything has to be to critical mass.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.560]   Right.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:45.760]   We are live from the CES, the Consumer Electronics X show in, uh, Las Vegas, Nevada, the 2012
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.760]   edition.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.880]   Uh, it's always fun to come here because there's lots of great toys.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.120]   Um, not a lot of Apple presence.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.880]   I don't think Apple's here in any way, but as always Apple.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.880]   They're wandering around.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   Oh, really?
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   You're seeing some people with a little Apple?
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   No, no, no.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.120]   I haven't seen any, I know guys, I know people at Apple and sorry.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   Are they stealth?
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   They're just walking around looking at everything.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.120]   They're playing with stuff.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.120]   They're just playing with stuff.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.120]   They like the toys too, right?
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   So, yeah, they're right.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   Right?
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   It doesn't.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.000]   Um, and we will continue with our coverage in just a little bit.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.840]   I'm so glad to have, uh, from cult of Mac, Efron Elijah, Erfan.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.600]   I always say Efron Elijah, uh, writes for the cult of Mac blog.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.400]   As does Leander Connie, who founded Cult of Mac.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.000]   He is the original cultist in LA.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.360]   Well, Cult of Android shows that you are open to other ideas.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.960]   I like that.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.520]   I think I should be going to call the windows.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.520]   Like I watch bombers keynote even though it's-
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.520]   It's a cult now.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.520]   What'd you think of that tweet course?
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.520]   It was pretty fun.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   It was bizarre.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.040]   It was bizarre, but once, after the initial shock, it was quite a funny.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:50.560]   So he, they, they hired a, uh, some church choir to come out and they're going, huh?
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.480]   They come out the, the stage.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   You can see it online.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.480]   Gospel tweets.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   And then they're singing tweets.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   #MicrosoftCES.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.480]   They were great singers.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.920]   Those two letters had really great voices.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   But I, you know-
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   Is that really what you want to do?
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.360]   What you want to have people talking about the day after your last keynote at CES?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.360]   T-shirts.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.920]   And the Gospel Tweed Singers.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   I don't know.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:15.640]   I think, I think lack of focus is con, is, is a general problem in Seattle.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   They also-
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.000]   You know, yeah, I think that's Ryan Seacrest, right?
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Exactly.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Yeah, I don't say that.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.480]   The best part about that Tweet Choir.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.520]   I don't know if you saw is they're very typical, like, church choir.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.480]   And then Ryan in the middle was a short, white, bald guy.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   Yeah, I saw him.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.120]   And I was like, who's that guy in there?
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.880]   How do you sneak in there?
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   Mm.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.960]   I forget, you guys can hear and see what I do.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:40.120]   Oh yeah, I think we have, but then we, then, but every time I go to the internet, I screw
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   everything up, right?
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.600]   It should be better.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   All right.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.720]   Cause I want, I want to play this and then we're going to do a commercial.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.600]   I'll tell you what, let me do the commercial.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.120]   And then when I come back, that's it.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.560]   That's what we call a tease in the business.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.400]   The problem is in podcasting, people just fast forward, right?
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   There's commercial stuff.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.160]   You don't want to do teases that are so good that people don't listen to the commercial.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:05.520]   We will be back and we will play for you the Tweet Choir at last night's final keynote
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.920]   from Microsoft.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.720]   Their last year at CES, their last booth.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.120]   Wow.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   Times are changing.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.400]   This used to be Microsoft's big show.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.440]   First, let's talk about Ford, whose big show it has been for the last couple of years.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.440]   Ford's has a big presence.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.120]   There's Ford automobiles everywhere.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.240]   Last couple of years, Alan Malali, the CEO of Ford, keynote.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:31.520]   He isn't doing it this year, but he, we will be talking to him at the Ford booth a little
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:35.360]   later on this afternoon interviewing him.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:41.800]   And they also are showing off it's interesting because at the same time as CES is going on
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.920]   here, the big Detroit auto shows going on today in Detroit.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.240]   And they're all up there.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   What happened to all of our cars?
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.240]   It's here.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.640]   Which I think is very telling.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:55.400]   Ford really thinks of itself in many ways as a consumer electronics company.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   So Alan's here.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.400]   We'll be talking to him.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.520]   I'm having dinner with him later tonight.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.200]   They showed off the 2013 Fusion.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.800]   They've got one out in the lobby.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   That is a nice car.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.320]   I want the plug in hybrid, 100 miles to the gallon.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.120]   Anyway, one of the nice things about all the new Ford vehicles is, of course, we've talked
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.960]   about it before, Ford Sync and this app like feature.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.200]   It's an API to the Ford Sync.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.600]   The sync is the thing in your car that you talk to the car and it does things like navigator,
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.320]   plays music, makes phone calls.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.560]   All without ever taking your hands off the wheel, your eyes off the road, you just press
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.120]   a button and it goes boom and you say what you want.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.600]   Well now you can actually talk to your smartphone and with apps that support the API, they will
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.920]   actually run and do things.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.040]   For instance, Pandora is one of the first apps they've come out with.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.200]   So you can talk to your phone.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.320]   You can say, play my Pandora classic rock station.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.640]   You can thumbs up and thumbs down just as you would do on the smartphone interface.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.720]   You can bookmark a song to buy it later.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.400]   You've got full control of Pandora.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.160]   They also have something called OpenBeak that will read tweets to you, read replies.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.720]   They won't sing them like a choir yet.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.040]   How much are they good if they want to?
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.040]   They totally could.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.520]   I think that would be a nice feature.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.520]   They have Stitcher slacker.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.200]   So you can listen to this show.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:08.120]   You could say, download and play Mac Break Weekly and it would do that.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.520]   All without taking your hands off the wheel.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.520]   I love that.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:14.600]   If you have not yet taken a look at Sync, go to your local Ford dealer and try it out
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   for a live one today.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.640]   The 2012 Ford Fiesta has this feature.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.280]   It's called App Link.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   You can find out more also online at Ford.com/technology.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.000]   Did you just got a Ford?
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Who?
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Fredrick Johnson.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.960]   Fredrick Van Johnson got a Ford, a good man.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:34.480]   He's been driving in Beemer forever and he went from a beemer to a Ford.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.920]   And he got the Explorer.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.520]   I think the Explorer like the SUV or the Edge?
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.520]   The Edge is the high tech.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.520]   It was so sweet.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.320]   He likes photographers like the Edge because it's really made for like.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.120]   Well, it just walks up to the back and it's a little butt.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.120]   And of course, Fredrick got it loaded.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.920]   Like it's just smart.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   It's a gorgeous car.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   It's a gorgeous car.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.400]   I know you're a Honda guy.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.840]   You and I were going to walk over and look at that Fiesta 2013.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   I don't know if I can.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   I don't know if I can.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.840]   Enough Fiesta Fusion.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.840]   I love the Fusion.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.840]   Awesome.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.840]   It's hybrid or hybrid plug-in.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.840]   Is it hybrid plug-in?
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.840]   Yes.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   Okay.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   I'll go over.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.800]   See, that's what you want because then you have the range because it's got an engine.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.280]   But because it's plug-in, you also have full battery capability and you really, you very
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   rarely use gas.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   We'll go over.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.440]   That's why the 100 miles a gallon doesn't really mean anything because it could be a
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   thousand.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440]   Right.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.440]   That's how you drive it.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.440]   All right.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for supporting our coverage by the way of CES 2012.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   We really appreciate it.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   Really, really quickly.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.480]   Yes.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:34.560]   Alex was saying that you've recognized some Apple guys who are here.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.680]   Tom Krasenova paid content just wrote an article while wandering around the central hall
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.120]   of the Las Vegas Convention Center.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:46.400]   I bumped into Greg Jazwiek, head of Iowa's product marketing for Apple just outside Sony's
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.400]   booth.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.880]   He said he was interested in how other companies present their products at events such as CES.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.640]   He seemed less than impressed with Sony's booth, but didn't really want to get into
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:01.760]   a lengthy discussion and his badge was strategically arranged as to cover his name and company affiliation.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   He's hiding out.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   But he's here.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.000]   I'll tell you the one you want to see is if you come in the front door of the central hall
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.760]   that big LG 3D display, it is like three stories tall.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.760]   It's huge.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.760]   It's amazing.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   Immersive.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.080]   And I'm, you know, I'm not a big 3D fan, but it really is amazing.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.080]   It's really cool.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.080]   All right.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   This was last night.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.080]   Steve Ballmer's last keynote.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.880]   He's sitting on stage with, what's his name?
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.360]   Ryan C. Krest.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   I don't know.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:34.240]   You think maybe American Idol might be looking at Ballmer for a judge or something like that?
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   I don't know.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.240]   Here, let's watch.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   Pick it up.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:45.280]   Oh, you're not getting audio, are you?
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.000]   You know, really is no good if you don't get audio.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.160]   I'm not doing anything different.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   We should be getting on it.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.960]   Maybe there's no, there's audio on this.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.320]   Here, hold on.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   Time out.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:03.840]   Let me make sure everything is set up properly.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.400]   We'll just stand at this part out.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.160]   No one will know what happened.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160]   Yeah, HDMI.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.360]   I was getting audio before when I did this.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.200]   Try it again.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.440]   You guys listening?
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.880]   Yeah, I hear it now.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.880]   Yay.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:41.360]   Yeah, there's a little guy in the back.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:48.400]   They really, they're in the back so you don't see him.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400]   This is the ball.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400]   Whitehead there.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:58.040]   Everyone can go ahead and watch the LSU Balmer game.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.880]   I watched them.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.920]   Microsoft C-E-S-K-N-O.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   Hashtag.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.120]   No, the man.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.360]   I'm wondering where they get these.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.280]   I mean, these seem like they're live.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.920]   I think they were doing them in real time.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   Are they reading off a screen?
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920]   They were reading them off a screen.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   That's really impressive.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   They have wonderful voices.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:37.040]   I just think this is a very weird pairing.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.640]   It's hard to make a clean out interest.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:48.640]   The best thing is hilarious.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   Hey, hey, somebody call out in Murphy.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   This is the best thing.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   No, Keelumi Online 100 is coming to America.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   And it's about before Prince Louis.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   The biggest mass choir, the tweet choir at the Microsoft.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   Steve Ball-McGino last night.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   They keep saying the same four words over and over.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:34.640]   Microsoft C-E-S-K-N-O.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   You can't give Windows 8's soul.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   I did say we saw the no-key in 900, or the Lumia 900,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.640]   they're calling it, just a minute ago.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.640]   And it is nice.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   I have to say, it's going to give the iPhone and Android
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   phones a run for their money.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.640]   I know a lot of people who are holding off of this one.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.640]   A buddy of mine at Big Tech site is holding off of this.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.640]   His dumping is Android phone for it.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   It will be a challenger.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   I think that's great.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.640]   We want to see competition.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.640]   Who knew that Windows Phone 7 would come out of nowhere
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   and actually be a fairly credible platform?
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.640]   It's going to make a really interesting three-horse race.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   That's what we want.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   Google is kind of like the new Microsoft.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   A little bit, they'll put it on any hands there.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   It goes from junk to really good stuff.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.640]   And now Microsoft's the new Apple in a way.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.640]   They're controlling it.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.640]   It's a coherent interface across a whole bunch of different devices.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.640]   The Xbox almost works just like Windows 8.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.640]   That metro interface will even be on the desktop, which is interesting.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   What do you think about the Connect for the desktop?
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.640]   They're going to offer a $250 special connect that lets you work close in.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   You'll be able to have voice control and motion control with Windows.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   So it'll be going like this, the metro desktop.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   I don't know.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.640]   I haven't actually used the Connect on the Xbox.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   It works.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   Does it consistently work all the time?
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   She loves it.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   It's called Dance Central.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   Awesome.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   It's the best thing in the world.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.640]   It's like one of the best uses of Connect ever, even though it's not the only one.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   And it works so well.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   It's fun because you dance and sees your outline.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.640]   You were dancing.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   I saw a video of you dancing with the new dance.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.640]   It's two players.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   And the woman I was competing against was a lot taller, but they can differentiate between the two of us
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   and we're competing together.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   But I don't use a desktop set up that often because I'm just portable and I've got this air
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.640]   and a couple other laptops.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   So it'll be interesting to see what something like that works on in an environment where
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   I'm not just sitting at a desk this far back.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.640]   I have to be on the go with gesture-based controls.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   The thing about this is it's something that Microsoft has that Apple does not have that nobody else has.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   So it's an opportunity for them to stand out a little bit.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   Whether it's a useful thing remains to be seen.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   The voice, too.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   They showed the voice on the Xbox and that works really well.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   It does.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   It'll be interesting to see if Siri comes.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   We're going to see voice every minute.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:09.640]   You need to see Dragon is now showing their TV interaction software or technology so that
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   you can just say play, go to this channel.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   They don't have any partners yet.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.640]   They were just showing it off as a technology example right now.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.640]   But I think obviously they are going to have the ones.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.640]   They're the ones.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   There's no one else.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.640]   And they can give you a lot.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   That's a Google.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   A much more open door of letting you have, be able to say a lot more because they have such a
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   deep vocabulary.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   Right.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.640]   Well, okay.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.240]   Let's go through the panel and just say anything that we've left out or that you're interested
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   or excited to see.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.640]   The Interconic, Cultive Mac, anything coming up that you're.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.640]   Well, the first thing you said was like this is not an Apple show really.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   I guess we found a few things.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   Exactly.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.640]   These days, you know, remember, I mean it was only even just a couple, three, four years
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.640]   ago, there would be a lot of stuff that wouldn't work with Apple devices.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.640]   Either the iPhone or the Mac.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.640]   And now these days everything works with Apple.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   You know, no one can release a product.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   If it doesn't, if it's not compatible with your iPhone or your iPad, it's another market.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   That is a huge shift.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.640]   I think it's a massive shift.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640]   How about you?
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.640]   I know you're going to be over at the cameras.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   That's going to be fun for you.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   Go see if there's anything new.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.640]   So I'll be interested to see what happens there.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.640]   I know that Sarah Lane, we're going to be going over on Thursday to do iPad today at the
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]   eyelash.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.640]   We did.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.640]   You know, last year we also spent some time because last year was the big Android tablet.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.640]   Everyone's going to crush the iPad or at least they had a lot of ideas.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.640]   I don't know if we're that interested in doing the same thing.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   Can we look at Windows 8 stuff?
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.640]   I think it's worth a few competitors.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.640]   I agree.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.640]   Let's see what else is going on.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.640]   This is got a new one based on a tech-rissery chip.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   It's only $250, which is fine.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   Android.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   And ice cream sandwich.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.640]   All right.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   I'm going to look at that.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   It's the lowest price point we've seen.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640]   Right.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.640]   And it's only 50 bucks more than a Kindle Fire, but a lot more powerful.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   Wow.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   That looks kind of interesting.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   That's interesting.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.640]   Anything else you're looking forward to finding on the show floor?
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.640]   3D TVs.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   You're going to buy a new TV?
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   I'm not crazy about the 3D thing.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.640]   I am interested in gesture controls.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   And certainly that LED stuff is just, you know, it's a couple years down the road, but
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   I'm really excited about where we're all going.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   And of course, iPad 3 cases.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   As you know, they're going to be there.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   Over in the China pavilion, somebody will be making iPad 3 cases.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   We also thank you, Erfan Laijia, for joining us.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   What are you excited about seeing?
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   You know, I haven't seen a ton yet, but I think one of the things that I was really happy
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640]   to see.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   I'm from Redmond, Washington.
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   I live in Seattle now.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   And I'm an Apple fan, you know, admittedly.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   You're the one.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   I am one of the people who really love that company, but it was really cool for me to go
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   to that Apple keynote and see people who are genuinely excited.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   The Microsoft key name.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   Microsoft key name.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   I'm sorry, the Microsoft keynote.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   And see people that were genuinely excited that Microsoft is releasing some new products
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.640]   because they've been doing kind of a lot of ho-hum things for quite a while.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   So it was cool to see them kind of get their spark back, get their groove back, if you will.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   Next week, Alex Lindsay, I have an assignment for you and Andy Inaco.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   There's two things we didn't talk about this week that I very much want to talk about.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:20.640]   One was an article in Slash.Today saying that the Indian government, it was a little
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   leaked memo by the Indian government that said that Apple, along with Blackberry and other
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.640]   phone Nokia, I think the other phone manufacturers, was allowing them a back door to encryption
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.640]   on the phone.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.640]   That is a very interesting accusation.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.640]   We'll see over the next week if that develops anything.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.640]   And then I want everybody to listen to this week's This American Life Show because they
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.640]   talk about Foxconn and do I think a really, really good job of --
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   I'm thinking you stop there.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   This American Life does a really, really --
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.640]   Well, they're getting more journalistic, which is interesting.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   So Mike Daisy, who's a friend of mine I've known for years, he's a monologist up in the
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   near Seattle area, as a matter of fact.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   He is an Apple fan.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640]   And he said, "I was an Apple fan.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.640]   Somebody sent me pictures of the Foxconn factory and I had to say, "Wow."
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   And I went to see for myself.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   So it starts with Mike Daisy and his tour of the Foxconn factory and some of the conditions
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640]   there.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   But then the second half of the show is their investigation of these accusations and allegations.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   And it is a must listen to anybody, not just who buys Apple gear, but buys any gear these
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   days because all of the stuff on this show floor is made in those factories.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   And I think if we're going to buy it, we ought to know where it comes from.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   So your assignment, boys and girls, for this week is to listen to Mr. Daisy in the Apple
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   gear.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   You can find it.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   It's free at thisamericanlife.org.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.360]   It's about an hour long.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.640]   And then we'll discuss next week, how about the little discussion group next week about
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   that.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   I thank you for joining us.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.000]   We are here at CES 2012 and we are going to continue with wall to wall coverage all day
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.280]   to day through Friday.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.240]   Lots of great stuff still to come, including tonight, Sarah and Dick DiBartolo.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.240]   Thank you for doing this for me.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.240]   You're welcome.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.240]   I'm excited.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   We'll do the weekly daily giveaways from showstoppers.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.040]   We'll go to the win and see what we can --
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.040]   That'll be fun.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040]   See what we can drum up.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.040]   Dicki D's in town.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.760]   And we've got -- we're going to have the daily giveaways from showstoppers later today.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   Stay tuned.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.400]   More to come from CES.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.000]   If you like the show, I hope you will tune in every -- we do the show every Tuesday,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.440]   11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern at twit.tv.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:37.000]   And of course, you subscribe on iTunes or, you know, I use downcast on the iOS devices.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   I love that.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   What's that iPod catcher that you really like?
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   It wasn't downcast.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   It's not another one that you really like.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Instacast.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.640]   Instacast was the first to incorporate iCloud.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   Right.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   Sinking.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.120]   Downcast now does it too, but Instacast has a really nice interface.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.440]   So subscribe because we love it if you get every single show.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.960]   We don't want you to miss someone.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   Now get back to work.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960]   Break time is it.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:00.960]   [music]
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.960]   [music]
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.120]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.760]   you
