[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Lori's here. Renee's here. Alex is here. We're going to talk about
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.160]   WWDC. It's coming up in a couple of weeks and the rumor is they're going to announce the arm-based
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.040]   Macs. We'll also talk about the rumor about a new iMac, what you could expect. And Apple's posted
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.280]   information about a password manager on GitHub. Maybe you'd like to write one. It's all coming
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.200]   next on Mac Break Weekly. Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twits LastPass Studios.

[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news. The news.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   We rotated Andy out this week. Lori Gill is in for Andy and Otko. Lori Gill, managing editor
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.440]   at iMore. We wrote you all equally. That's all I know. Hi, Lori. I heard you before the show.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.360]   Alex was doing his office hours on Projectors. Are you going to have a giant projectors stage
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.160]   for Sickburn's Budokan performance? Is that what's going on? That sounds fun.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.840]   We can arrange that. Alex Lindsey can arrange that. That's his motto. I can arrange that.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   090.media. He is the king of streaming media there and everywhere.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.080]   And it's good to see you, Alex. Welcome. Good to be here. And all the way to my left,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.800]   your left, my right stage somewhere is Renee Richie of youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.200]   Hey, Renee. Hey, thank you for having me back. I appreciate it. I just I know that
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.640]   the weeks when Andy is the most passionate about a topic is the weeks we don't have them on.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.800]   I know it sucks. It sucks. I just we just do it basically in rotation because I can't handle five
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.880]   people very well on the on a I think it's just too many to do for a show. I thought it was levels.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.680]   You judge which one of us is going to break levels particularly. Slightly asking to come back
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   next week and we're calmer. Calm down. So what would it be? Andy is upset about this week.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.360]   What would be the big story for Andy? I don't know. I just I just figured he's going to be all
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.720]   sorts of exuberant about the possible incredible painful transition to arm processes on the back.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.760]   We're getting closer. Now Mark Gurman says on Bloomberg that Apple will announce it.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.640]   The arm chips on Mac at WWDC, which is next week or two weeks, I guess. That's pretty exciting.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.480]   June 22nd. That makes sense. We've even I think you might have speculated that, Renee, that
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.920]   if you're going to get people moving to arm in 2021 and that's the other rumor that you're going
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.840]   to have to tell developers now. Yeah, I don't know if they will, but they literally could just take
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.000]   Steve Jobs's keynote from the power party seat and tell transition over double words like it like
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.480]   the Mac is living a double life. It's all about power efficiency, you know, power per milliamp
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.320]   or performance per milliamp and just replay that entire thing and say we looked at the road map,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.600]   you know, it's more of a parking map at this point. And we believe that we can make a better
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.040]   future with our own Silicon Destiny and then do my biggest question is, are they going to do a
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.320]   monolithic keynote if they don't have to put everyone in the room or will there be like announcements
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.760]   all week instead of all on one day? So like it'll be super fun if there is a jam-packed keynote on
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.560]   Monday where they drop one news bomb after the other. But an argument could be made that spacing
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.400]   them out and having like an iPhone day and an iPad day and a Mac day could be just as interesting
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.200]   since we're all watching from home. Yeah, especially, yeah, especially right now where, you know,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.640]   every day is potentially a keynote that that could be what they do every single day, just kind of
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.840]   make an announcement for the next big thing that's coming. Oh, I hope every day is not a keynote.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.440]   It will take so much, right? Oh my God. Let's see, June 22 is a Monday, right? Yeah. So we'll
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.120]   definitely cover whatever they do Monday, Tuesday, who knows? I mean, we'll be doing Mac Break Weekly.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.280]   I guess we could either be talking about what they announced on Monday or if they're doing,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.720]   this is the problem is we won't know until it's actually happening. So we may be starting Mac Break
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.000]   Weekly next Tuesday and then say, oh, we're going to cut right now to the stage. There's, well,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.400]   it won't be the stage. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work to do keynotes every day. So,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.520]   yeah, yeah. If they're pre if they're pre, you know, films, you know, they just have to hit the
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.120]   play button and we just watch when you work on a when you work on a lot of keynotes, though,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.640]   that it's it's not just what's happening on stage. It is all the PR around it, all the planning,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.960]   all the process. There's just this massive village, almost a small city that that is part of the,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   of the push of giving that. I'm not saying that they're not going to do that. They may decide to
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.480]   do it all week, but if they do, it's really hard. There's a reason that they don't that most
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.320]   companies don't do that is it's not just because of the stage and everything else. It's because
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.200]   the PR gets everybody queued up and teed up for it and there's streams and there's, you know,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.480]   where they're going to get, you know, where they're going to do ad buys and, you know, all the other
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.200]   things that are really, you know, all these companies when they're when they're doing these
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.320]   keynotes, there's just this giant machine that that you're kind of in the middle of to make that
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.280]   work. And so I think that it's, it's challenging to stretch it out for the entire,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.120]   the entire village that's involved with rolling anything out new.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.040]   There's also so many potential.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   They might do it, but I don't think there's so many potential points, a failure too of like,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   oops, we accidentally announced something earlier than we were supposed to or something like that.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.720]   Yeah, somebody got my big question is like, what it there's like so far, look at my timeline. And a
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.760]   bunch of people are, oh God, finally Intel's been so slow. I just want the battery life improvements,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.640]   the performance improvements, the, you know, the ability to not have fans going all the time.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   And then you see developers and people who run Windows and they're like, oh, they're going to,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.880]   they got rid of, they're going to get rid of OpenGL. They've already got rid of 32-bit apps.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.840]   I'm not going to be able to compile anything. I'm not going to be able to run virtual machines.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.760]   What's going to happen to my Windows boot camp? And it seems like all of these things are equal
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.320]   parts, pleasure and pain to different people at different times.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.240]   And I don't, and I think that the transition, my guess is the transition will take at least two
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.320]   or three years to do a complete transition, maybe five. I think the air type
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.080]   computer is probably the most reasonable one to start with. But then after that, I think you
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.920]   started slowly moving towards the pro, the pro machines, but I think the pro machines could be
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.320]   20, 20, 3, 24. You think they'll do that though? They won't keep Zions or whatever the Intel chip
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.640]   is on an iMac Pro and the Pro. I think that, I think eventually, eventually they could move
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.000]   over to ARM, but I don't think it's going to be any time soon. I mean, if they did it in five
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.160]   years, I'd be impressed. What would be missing? Is it raw performance or something else?
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.120]   Well, it's also the support from the apps. The apps that are needed for the pro side are just
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.520]   much different than the app. It's one thing to make your smaller computers run it, but
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.640]   is Photoshop going to run on it? And is Maya going to run on it?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.280]   And is there will run all these other... Is it emulation? Will they run? Or will you have to
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.960]   problem is that graphics processing needs generally on the pro side.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.200]   That has to be redone. It really needs to be at full performance. And I think eventually,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.240]   it may run faster and may run better. But I think that they're going to... What Apple doesn't need
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.360]   is to be... They've just come out with one of the best pieces of hardware ever made as far as the
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.200]   Mac Pro goes. Why cut it out of the knees with some kind of new fangled chip?
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:34.160]   Also, the I/O story. Right now, they're dependent. It's a bad word, but they have PCIe and Thunderbolt
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.800]   3, and that's going to move to USB 4 and Thunderbolt 4 or whatever. But they don't have an arm story
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.880]   around Thunderbolt yet. And what are you going to do on the high level pro computers? I think
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   there's a lot of... They need time to ramp up things like the amount of power you can have in an
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.800]   ARM chip. We haven't seen Apple make like a 65 watt. Any really high-end ARM chips yet.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.080]   And we haven't seen them do a lot of high-end I/O yet. They max out at USB-C on the iPad Pro.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.440]   But I think Alex is right that over the four or five years, a lot of that can change.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.960]   The good news is USB 4 is soon, and it uses the Type-C connector, right?
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.240]   So I wonder... I'm standing. Yeah, we have one more...
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.600]   Yeah, one more confusing...
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.560]   That one is compatible with everything else between our Thunderbolt and our USB-C.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.000]   And the ones that have a power for beta, you're just like...
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.440]   I feel like Apple should dump Thunderbolt. With USB 4 coming, which has similar throughput,
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.400]   right? It's almost as fast. It's basically Thunderbolt.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   It would just... It's 40 gigabits, which is what Thunderbolt is. I feel like...
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:45.280]   I feel like this would be a good time to unify and say, "Look, if you see a Type-C connector,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.360]   it's going to be USB 4." And it'll do all the same. It'll do DisplayPort.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.960]   It'll do all the other things charging.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   Power delivery?
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.120]   Yeah, PD. So why not just say... I feel like Apple... That Thunderbolt is Apple's last...
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.320]   is like Firewire. Apple has had a history...
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:09.920]   Scuzzy, Firewire Thunderbolt, of kind of throwing themselves into the latest new thing,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   and then slow adoption on the PC side, slow adoption from the peripheral manufacturers.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.360]   So that was a huge advantage for Apple. The Firewire... What might look like a fiasco from the outside
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   is that... So Apple first made it... First, there was no royalties on Firewire, until all the
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.520]   camera manufacturers had it embedded in all those cameras. And then...
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.360]   Because that was the easiest way to get it. And then Apple...
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.560]   Then we chatted...
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   I think it was $2, something like that. But when you look at how that rolls up the chain,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.760]   it ends up increasing the cost of a computer by 50 bucks.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.160]   And so when it's magnified. And so what it did is it stopped all the PC manufacturers and it just
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.920]   destroyed doing video on a PC for a long time. Because it was... If you had a camera, you'd be like,
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.800]   "Oh, I got Firewire. It'll just work." So I'm going to buy a Mac. So people were buying Macs because
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.080]   it was easier to just take Firewire cameras. So Apple, before they needed... When they needed that
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:13.760]   kind of edge, they got it by keeping the PC manufacturers out of using Firewire. And basically,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.000]   you had all these stupid ways of trying to get into a PC from those cameras.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.680]   I mean, it just was really painful for a couple of years. And so it just set them back years.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.360]   If you were a PC user doing video in the early 2000s, you were crazy.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.120]   People like us were like, "That is so weird. Why would you do that?" Because it's so hard.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.920]   And so Apple, that was a really good move by Apple that served its use for while it did it as a
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.720]   business. I mean, we can talk Andy if he was here. It'd be very upset about the whole thing.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.240]   But the... I'll be upset for him. I hate it. I'm mad.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:55.920]   But from a tactical perspective of owning your market, Apple did a pretty good job there of
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.440]   keeping PC manufacturers away from... What was at the time one of their core markets?
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.320]   Yeah. That doesn't seem like a good thing.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.000]   It's not a good thing from a competition perspective.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.200]   For a user's point of view.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.000]   For pros, it did give... Even Thunderbolt gave a lot of throughput that just wasn't available
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.520]   through any other interconnected at the time.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.760]   So, but we're going to enter a new era. If you're going arm, why not just go USB 4 across the board?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.720]   It's got power delivery. This is Jim Salter's article from last September. But he describes
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.480]   all the capabilities. This is an RST technical and says 2020, we're going to start seeing USB
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.000]   4 by 2021 widespread availability that ties nicely with the arm schedule calendar.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.280]   I feel like this would be a good time to handle that. Anyway, I don't know why I threw that one in.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.640]   It's Apple, you know, they're going to come up with their next generation proprietary called
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.600]   Stormport or something. It'll unify lightning and Thunderbolt instead of USB.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.560]   So, if you go arm, do you have to have... You can't use Radeon cards. You have to now have
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.960]   the arm GPUs, Alex, is that the case?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.000]   I don't know if you have to.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.320]   Do you not? Can you use wrong?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.840]   Because that would solve some of the compatibility issues if the GPU is the same.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.320]   Well, by having everybody write to metal, that solves that problem.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.800]   That's right.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.080]   It allows Apple basically.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.000]   Yes. Yeah, the whole point is that you write to what an intermediary that Apple does.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.400]   An Apple can change whatever it wants over and behind it.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.280]   And it doesn't affect you.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.400]   How is Metal Adoption?
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.360]   It keeps you in GPU and...
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.760]   Is Metal Adoption pretty universal in the Mac space?
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.120]   It's not universal, but it's definitely picking up speed.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.440]   I mean, everyone knows that it's going to get harder and harder to...
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.760]   And this, giving people a year to understand why it's important to do that,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.760]   will also continue to accelerate that. But I don't think Apple is going to support OpenGL.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.640]   I mean, as they should, with ARN.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.800]   They should support it at all very well.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.920]   My guess is also that they'll be doing custom GPUs for the...
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.840]   For where they use Intel embedded right now,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.600]   they'll do their own custom GPUs.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.880]   And those will probably be way better than Intel's GPU.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.480]   So people who use things like 12-inch MacBooks or anything that's relied on and integrated
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.800]   the Mac, whatever the Mac mini style devices,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.720]   those will have much better power, much better power efficiency from the graphics.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.560]   But they'll still go to discrete...
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.440]   Because there's...
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.360]   I don't think Apple's going to be spinning things like giant Nvidia or
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   Radeon cards anytime soon, so they'd have to have some capability of...
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.840]   ARM has always had its own Mali GPU capabilities.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.640]   I have no idea how good they are, but that's what phones use.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.000]   They don't have dedicated...
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.440]   Apple uses imagination, yeah.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.200]   As you...
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.040]   I think the big thing is as you interact with Apple hardware,
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.680]   as this keeps on moving forward, as Apple gets rid of
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.360]   Intel, the issue is really going to be the separation between
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.640]   companies that make software for many platforms and companies that make only for Apple.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.840]   If you're only making it for Apple, I think you're going to see a lot more performance.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.880]   You're going to see a much better experience for the user,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.680]   and it's just going to get harder and harder to write cross-platform apps.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.920]   That doesn't hurt necessarily.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.800]   I mean, I only got Apple carriers.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.400]   That's that same kind of lock-in, yeah.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.880]   That's the same...
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.360]   Yeah, so...
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.560]   I was joking earlier on...
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.160]   Go ahead.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.000]   I was going to say I was joking earlier on Twitter that part of the announcement will be one more
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.520]   thing. It turns out electron apps don't work on that.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.320]   Oh, that would be nice.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.720]   We don't know.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.440]   We tried.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.320]   We rebooted.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.600]   We flashed the pram.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.440]   We got a second latte from Cafe Max, but things just won't run.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.560]   Sorry.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.000]   Here's our...
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.800]   Here's our...
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.560]   Here's our APIs from making capital tech.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.760]   Electron is in a flash.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.560]   I wouldn't mind that.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.760]   I mean, it would kill a whole lot of apps that are electron-based right now,
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.440]   as for cross-platform reasons.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.360]   So, if you were an Apple developer right now,
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.640]   the best thing to do would be to do it in Xcode, use metal,
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.240]   use all the Apple frameworks.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.320]   Don't be doing your own thing.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.920]   And I guess it wouldn't be so hard to have a flip a switch in Xcode and say,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   "Okay, now transpile, cross compile over to ARM."
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.240]   Depending on your dependency...
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.000]   Sorry, depending on your dependencies.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.080]   Well, stop using that Intel reference code.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.200]   That's always a bad idea.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.600]   You're not the only one who feels a lot of things.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.960]   Sorry.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.520]   If you've got time, the big thing is,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.800]   every time you update,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.720]   is that you have to tackle different parts of the code to get it.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.640]   Well, Apple gave us six or seven years to fix 32 to 64.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.880]   It was not like a...
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.840]   It's very slow-moving.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.040]   And then people were all up in the arms,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.280]   and I still have apps that won't work because they didn't...
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.040]   They didn't move to 64.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.840]   So it's finally happened a long time ago.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.440]   So that's a long time.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.720]   But the problem was it was too long,
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.080]   because if Apple gave them a year,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.280]   they would have been sat down and done it.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.920]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.960]   But because they gave them a decade,
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.200]   the people who coded it were no longer at those companies.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.440]   Right.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.200]   And they had no idea how to go back and fix all those things.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.520]   We'll find out if this other strategy is a better strategy,
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.920]   because I have a feeling Apple's going to be a little bit more.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.400]   The thing is that they've been doing this for years.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.760]   Like previously, they went from the old system of software to Next.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.320]   They just bought Next and they made OS X.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.520]   And they're not doing it this time,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.880]   but year after year,
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.680]   they are replacing all of the modules inside Next.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.800]   And you'll probably go get to the kernel.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.600]   They've been rewriting the kernel for a long time as well.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.280]   And each of those steps has been painful.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.400]   Like APFS was really painful for some people.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.240]   And rewriting the diamonds, like launch D.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.480]   And what was the other one, the networking demon,
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.440]   they had to roll that back.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.320]   It was so painful.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.360]   But you know, wasn't painful.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.600]   The end user experience was pretty transparent.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.040]   I mean, if you depended on 32-bit apps,
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.760]   like if you were a gamer or if you were somebody using audio plugins,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.880]   that bit you really hard.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.920]   But my thing is like, it's like 80% of people won't notice.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.840]   And those are the people who like they buy a Mac,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.960]   and they type, you know, maybe into a typing app or into
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.480]   Google Docs or something.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.240]   And they use like all the built-in stuff.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.480]   They may not notice the transition at all.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.760]   And 20% of people will be absolutely tortured by it.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   But those are the same people who have been tortured by Apple
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.200]   for the last decade.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.920]   You know, every year.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.400]   And the hard part.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.560]   The hard part for the developer is that they're not going to,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.120]   the user isn't going to blame Apple.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   If a user downloads your app and it doesn't work,
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.160]   they're going to blame the developer.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.560]   They're like,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   "System integrity protection and driver kit."
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.000]   And you know, some like super duper app has had to be written
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.560]   how many times now because Apple, or even like BVAD,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.240]   because Apple's taken away certain privileges
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.280]   that they used to just have for free on an open architected
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.240]   Mac of the past.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.200]   And that's all.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.760]   For anyone who's doing anything outside a Mac App Store app,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.120]   it's really painful.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.880]   Well, that's why you-
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.840]   I think it's harder and harder with every new software iteration too.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.960]   It's, I can imagine it must be really frustrating for
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.320]   Mac app developers coming from something that was more open,
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.960]   where, you know, just do what you want on your computer.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.000]   From my perspective, I'm always disappointed to hear
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.800]   when more software security features come into play
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.480]   that are great for my protection,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.600]   but also limiting for what I want to put on my computer.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.760]   I do feel like I should have that option.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.280]   I think we've talked about this before.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.560]   It'd be nice to have a little button or a little switch
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.800]   that lets you say, you know,
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:05.280]   I take on the responsibility of understanding the issues
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.040]   that could come into play if I download this.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.680]   And then it's on you if you break your computer down
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   with something-
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.040]   Well, it kind of do. It's a command line though.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.240]   It's in the shell, right?
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.800]   So they kind of-
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.280]   Right.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.400]   If you're-
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.520]   I mean, if that's what you want,
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.280]   you should be able to use the shell.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.120]   I think that's actually something you said is that
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.240]   if you want that, exactly what you're saying is that
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.520]   if you want those kinds of-
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.720]   to release those protections,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.920]   you better know how to do it.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   So that's-
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.600]   You know, I don't know if that's conscious on Apple's part,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.760]   but that's not a bad way to do it.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760]   Say you got at least know how to open a terminal
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   and run type in a command.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.120]   It seems like a minimum.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.080]   And one of the things we get into though is that,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.880]   you know, you have to wait
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.160]   whether Apple thinks it's important.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.720]   This is where the-
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.320]   this is the problem with all of this,
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.520]   is that there's been, like,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.120]   for instance, we're doing a lot of video conferencing
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.360]   and there's been chaos in the video conferencing world
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.480]   only on the Mac.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.800]   Really?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.280]   Because-
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.640]   Because of security,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.760]   everyone started-
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.400]   basically everyone started following Apple's rules
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.120]   about signing their apps and so on and so forth.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.920]   And so-
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.520]   So suddenly Zoom, all the-
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   if you had a-
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.840]   if you wanted to use a virtual camera,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.880]   which means that if you're using-
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.360]   Yeah, you can.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.440]   Something like memo live or OBS or-
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.560]   or you can't-
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.040]   you would-
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.200]   to use a virtual camera to get into Zoom,
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.360]   for instance, or into other apps.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.280]   Suddenly all that just stopped working.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.240]   Is that what happened?
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.600]   I was wondering what happened.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.400]   That was Apple's gatekeepers.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:22.800]   It wasn't-
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.960]   It was Apple's gatekeeper.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.760]   It had always been there.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.280]   They just weren't following the rules.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.480]   You know, like they were just-
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.760]   they had skipped over the rules.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.440]   And so when they all-
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.000]   Well, no.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.800]   When-
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.360]   Right.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.320]   So when Zoom said,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.120]   "Oh, you know what? We're gonna-
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.760]   so like Zoom two weeks ago,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.280]   you could unmute somebody.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:39.840]   Now you can't.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.800]   You can't-
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.720]   You can't unmute the other side now.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.080]   You can request their unmute,
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.760]   which is the same way Hangouts work forever
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.880]   and everything else.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.280]   But the virtual cameras all stopped working.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.640]   Now they're working again,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.800]   and there's a different set of processes.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.760]   But it's been-
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.160]   but it took a while because Apple's system is not-
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.680]   you know, there's just not a lot of infrastructure
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.880]   for that type of thing.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.160]   Just is what you said, actually.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.760]   I blame Zoom for that.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.120]   Because Zoom historically didn't want to do anything Apple's way.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.800]   And so when Apple changed the rules,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.480]   they weren't ready to fix it.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.600]   The reason why they're doing it-
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.080]   The reason why they're doing it-
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.040]   Apple's way, right?
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.800]   I mean, well, the reason Zoom has,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.240]   you know, really ran the-
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.880]   ran the table in the spring was because it was really easy to use.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.360]   Right.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.240]   And then they-
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.680]   so then they have all these people using it,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   but now it's got security issues.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.040]   And so now they've tightened all those security issues down,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.880]   and they've worked on their-
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.400]   the two big things for Zoom are stability and security.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.520]   And so they've been tweaking all of those.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.360]   And of course, it just causes more trouble here,
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.960]   but no one's going somewhere else
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.720]   because nothing else is competitive right now.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.920]   I mean, they're trying.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.640]   We might see competitive solutions in the fall,
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.800]   as Google and Microsoft and other folks increase their feature set,
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.840]   but they're way-
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.560]   they're just-
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.480]   they're at least a year behind.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.000]   You said what if you've-
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.960]   Well, I have to say-
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.320]   Yeah, I mean, it's not beyond ease of usage.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.760]   It's just the set of-
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   the tool set is so much deeper in Zoom that it'll take them.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.000]   So they got what they needed, which was the expansion.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.760]   I don't think they meant to get it that fast,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.880]   but they now have a year ahead of time,
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.760]   and they're just now-
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.360]   all they have to do is tighten all the hatches.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.080]   It'll probably be-
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.640]   Yeah, anyway.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   You obviously-
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.680]   I use all of them every day.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.000]   Deep, deep.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.640]   I just use them all-
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.520]   I use them all every day.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.280]   Like, I literally am on almost-
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:25.920]   I was-
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.720]   Today, this morning, so far, I've been on Zoom, BlueJeans,
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.080]   Skype here.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.240]   And you accidentally streamed a stream that you were streaming in the Galaxy.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.000]   Like, been three layers deep,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   like Zoomed your Skype call that was in Hangouts.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.080]   No, I've had ones where I had something opened,
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.240]   and I was in two different places one time.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.360]   Fortunately, no one was in the other one,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.840]   but I suddenly realized that I had two things open at the same time.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.280]   You get lost in the windows.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.720]   But then everyone's like chime.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   You have like chime that Amazon has,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.320]   and you're like, why do they even keep developing that?
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.000]   Have you ever been on a chime call?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.760]   Nobody's asked me to be on a chime call yet.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.000]   No.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.200]   Thank goodness.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.760]   They just just-
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.560]   They resent it, though.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.880]   I was on a Zoom call yesterday, I had to upstate Zoom,
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.520]   and I don't like installing all this stuff on my Mac.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.280]   You don't need to with WebRTC.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.640]   But nobody will use my Jitzy server.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.200]   Nobody.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.920]   So, it's frustrating to me,
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.760]   because I hear I am installing Zoom.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.440]   And I already told Lisa,
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.640]   the minute quarantine's over,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.400]   I'm erasing this iMac and starting over.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.520]   Because it's kind of-
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.480]   Okay, well then everything's over.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.680]   Now that you have Zoom,
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.480]   now that you have Zoom,
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.320]   I want you to come on my little morning thing
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.760]   and do a second hour with us.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.600]   Well, I won't be on, but I'll be sitting in the-
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.440]   I'll be sitting in the bleachers.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.080]   Absolutely.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.600]   No, I want you to come on and talk to people about it.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.880]   I don't know sh- anything.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.560]   But you know what you like.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.200]   I know what I like.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.280]   You know how to stop yourself from coming on the air.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.800]   Yeah, I do know that.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.600]   You don't have to pick that up to Jill Laurie.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.440]   Hey Laurie, my Traeger comes Thursday by the way.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.960]   Ooh, how exciting.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.320]   So excited.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.760]   Every single weekend now,
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.520]   we've been slow roasting different various meats.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.960]   We did a brisket and-
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.480]   That's the first thing I'm going to do.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.840]   What do we do, a brisket and-
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.960]   Oh, and a parch holder.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.720]   What flavor pellets do you use?
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.840]   Just the general ones?
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.320]   We got the mesquite pellets and the general pellets.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.000]   And I actually prefer the-
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Wait, which is for the-
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.960]   (laughs)
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.840]   Traeger and the Traeger.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.320]   I knew Alex.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.920]   This is by the way how I completely-
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.160]   Do you completely-
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.560]   I thought it threw Alex off the track.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.680]   Because I knew that he would-
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.280]   I'd squirm onto this one.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.720]   I will be-
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.480]   I will come on Alex, I promise.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.080]   I'll come on, not tomorrow.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.520]   I'll come on Thursday.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.280]   No, it takes a while to schedule.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.000]   We have to schedule it.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.800]   Oh, you're scheduling.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.840]   Oh, I didn't even know you were-
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.880]   It's like we're dancing.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.840]   It's like we could do it.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.800]   It's every-
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.480]   It's like-
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.080]   There's a second hour every-
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.440]   We had 350 people on this morning talking about mike placements.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.240]   So awesome.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.720]   I could learn so much.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.840]   I should really go to these things.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.560]   I would learn so much.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.760]   Tomorrow we're talking about optics.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.520]   And you're not talking about political optics.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.200]   You're talking about actual optical-
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.640]   Actual-
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.440]   Actual what light does before it gets to the sensor.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.280]   We're going to have an hour discussion on that.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.520]   But one of the things people have been asking for is-
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.560]   They want to have a host-
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.680]   You know, talk about hosting and shows and stuff like that.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.000]   And there's a lot of Macbreak listeners now that are
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.520]   in the group.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.040]   So they've been like, "When is Leo coming up?"
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.520]   I'll be glad.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.080]   I'm going to ask-
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.960]   I have to get up early.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.120]   Okay.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.840]   7am.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.560]   Oh my god.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.400]   You don't have to get up early.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.760]   You don't have to be there until you get there.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.960]   10 year on the East Coast.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.280]   Oh, it's like I'll be in the Today Show fourth hour.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.160]   Is that what's going on?
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.800]   I'll be in the kind of-
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.240]   You and Hoda.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.640]   No, no, no.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.040]   This is-
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.680]   It's the primary.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.720]   It's the draw.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.560]   In the animal in the cooking segment.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.080]   Anyway, so-
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.280]   Everybody's all warmed up.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.960]   You weren't here, but Laurie-
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.800]   Every time Laurie has a pick,
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.760]   I fear it because I buy everything she recommends.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.360]   I don't know what it is about you, Laurie.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.320]   Maybe we just aren't a wavelength, but there's-
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.440]   We got to figure on them.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.320]   We like good things.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.040]   That's what it is.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.160]   So she was-
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.120]   My big green egg is-
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.280]   You know, Alex and I both have big green eggs,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.000]   which we love,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.240]   but my big green eggs getting cracked.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:58.720]   I use-
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.680]   I maybe get it too hot.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.920]   I don't know, but the inner liner got cracked.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.960]   It's starting to wear out.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.000]   It's been eight years.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.880]   It's fine.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.800]   I use it like five times a week.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.920]   I do a lot of barbecue.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.280]   So Laurie mentioned this Traeger grill.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.480]   Are you familiar with these, Alex?
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.880]   It says, "Much a smoker as it is a grill."
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.400]   And she said she just got the 780 Pro.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.280]   Which really looks pretty damn good.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.080]   So it's a pellet.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.240]   I mean, use that to roast people on Twitter as well as me.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.120]   Oh, God, if only.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.920]   I put some people that's got two wrecks for Twitter users.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.080]   So-
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.040]   That's awesome.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.480]   The idea is-
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.000]   This is a pellet grill.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.080]   So it stores pellets there and it has a little auger
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.760]   that slowly pushes them in and a little bucket
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.440]   on the other end where the ashes come out.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.480]   But-
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.720]   The coolest thing that Laurie mentioned is it's Wi-Fi enabled.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.520]   So I can control it with my phone.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.240]   They call it Wi-Fire.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.280]   Wi-Fire.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.480]   Oh, I'm fired.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.520]   So I can control it with my phone.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.160]   I did, by the way, get the Traeger pellet sensor as well.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.960]   So I'd know when I was-
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.360]   Oh, you remember I had said like that was the one thing.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.840]   It was like, I have to go out and just check and make sure
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.440]   that there's still pellets in the grill.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.000]   I don't want to go out.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.120]   With that sensor, you don't even have to do it.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.160]   I ain't going out, man.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.800]   I'm just going to-
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   34 burger capacity, Leo.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.360]   30 freaking four burgers, baby.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.080]   Yeah, that's a whole baseball game.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.680]   Six racks of ribs.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.240]   It's a 780 square inches of cooking space.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   So anyway, yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.680]   But I'm not getting rid of the big green egg, right, Alex?
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.720]   That's still the king in terms of flavor.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.480]   Yes.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.400]   For barbecue, it absolutely is.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.280]   This only goes up to 500 degrees, which is shocking.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.320]   It's chilly.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.440]   How do you cook a pizza on that?
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.440]   I have the little uni that goes up to-
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.080]   Well, it's got a smoker in it.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   It's really a smoker.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.120]   I think it's a smoker and a grill.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.320]   You're supposed to cook it slow.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.240]   So that's why I'm going to do the brisket.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.120]   How was the brisket?
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.240]   Oh my god.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.600]   That's so good.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.640]   Are you a dry rub?
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.920]   Are you a dry rub gal?
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.720]   It's a dry rub.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:57.840]   It was a dry rub.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.280]   It was very tasty.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.000]   OK.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.800]   How long did you cook it?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.840]   Uh, six hours.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.080]   Because it has the wifire, you can literally set the temperature.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.400]   Fire.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.560]   And it just slowly puts the pellets in as it's needed.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.160]   It's pretty-
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.360]   It's like-
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.720]   I mean, honestly, for people who like to smoke meats,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.880]   they probably wouldn't like this as much
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.400]   because you're not sitting in the backyard for six hours,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.600]   poking at your sticks-
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.400]   It's a big old brush.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.160]   Or trying to keep the temperature going.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.480]   You know?
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.800]   Like, I get that there's like a joy in all of the like,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.440]   babysitting your smoker.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.200]   But from people like me,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.960]   this is like throw a 20-pound slab of meat on it,
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.040]   turn it on, walk away, come back,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.560]   eat the most delicious food ever.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.160]   Like, it's great.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.440]   Oh my god.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.640]   Well, I justified it because it's not cheap as a thousand bucks,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.920]   but I justified it.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.120]   A, because I'm not going anywhere.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.400]   I'm not eating out.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.000]   I might as well be able to smoke my own gosh darn brisket in the house.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.960]   So that's why.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.080]   Why have a house if you can't smoke brisket in it?
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.000]   If you can't smoke in your meats.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.120]   Anyway, Alex, I would love to.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.880]   We're talking about Alex's office hours.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.640]   And if you're interested in this, it's daily,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.440]   seven days a week.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:20.320]   The warm up begins six AM Pacific, seven AM is when the conversations begin eight.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.520]   There's a topic, right Alex?
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.880]   And then eight AM.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.280]   Well, so seven AM is, so six AM, we all just start,
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:25.840]   we have coffee.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.400]   We're talking.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.960]   It's still turning in.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.760]   It's informal.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.640]   Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's not as good,
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.160]   but it's really, it's pretty fun.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.880]   And then at eight, at seven o'clock we do Q&A.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.560]   So any questions about media production,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.120]   and it can be everything from film to live or whatever,
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.920]   from seven to eight.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.760]   And then eight, we have a second hour.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.160]   So that second hour changes every day.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.760]   And it's a subject that we're interested in.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.560]   So it's a very wide range.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.480]   We had mic placement today.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.840]   Tomorrow we have optics.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.720]   Thursday we have mass production of baseball cards from photos.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.520]   What?
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.160]   How do you know?
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.720]   How do you know?
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.200]   How do you know?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.040]   Like if you were going to take a whole baseball team for high school or a grade school,
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.960]   how do you just take all those photos and punch out?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.440]   That's so sweet.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.480]   Like actually accurate.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:06.960]   It's quite wide range.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.440]   One of our members knows how to do it.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.920]   And then Friday we're talking about Wirecast.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:18.240]   And then Saturday we talk about Unreal and Final Cut and Live Graphics and Networking.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.160]   So it's a crazy--
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.000]   It just changes every day.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.600]   YouTube recommended every day now.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.080]   I just go there and you've got Alex and his group of people.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.720]   Yeah, well you show up at my YouTube recommended every day now.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.480]   So Renee, so it's fair.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.360]   It's Alex Lindsey on youtube.com/AlexLinzielanddsay.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.240]   And there's a link in there to the Zoom if you want to do it in the Zoom.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.920]   But he does later post it on YouTube.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.600]   You don't stream the whole thing live on YouTube, right?
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.240]   You just post it.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.960]   We stream the--
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.560]   It was just stream the Q&A.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   So 7 to 8 is streamed every week.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.840]   Oh, so you can just all index.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.200]   So it's all indexed.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.480]   So if you want to see what it's even looking like,
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.200]   you can open it up and click on times and just jump to see what the discussion looks like.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.000]   Nice.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.560]   Very cool.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.120]   Apple, another rumor.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.560]   WWDC may also have a redesigned iMac.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.680]   Oh, please Apple, don't do this to me, please.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.000]   I'm ready for a new iMac.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.200]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.400]   This is from Sunny Dixon.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.280]   I can't afford it, but it's going to resemble the XDR.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.080]   It's going to have very slim bezels, according to Sunny.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.280]   The iPad Pro design language.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.640]   What does that mean to you, Renee?
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.680]   I don't know what that means.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.320]   So the only reason why I wonder is because he's got that separate from the
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.560]   Thanos snapped bezels.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.200]   You know, Apple usually snaps their fingers and takes half the bezels off,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.120]   but that's what they did with the iPad Pro.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.400]   And the iMac is already pretty squared off.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.840]   Like it's already got similar language.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.560]   I'm not sure why those two things are separated.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.760]   I'm also not.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.040]   So I thought the new design was coming with the mini LED displays.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.720]   And rumor has that those displays have been pushed out till next year,
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.280]   unless the iMac is going to debut those displays away at debuted IPS panels,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.640]   you know, several years ago.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.960]   So maybe this is going to be an iMac Pro,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.680]   or is it going to be the regular iMac?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.000]   Because I think the Apple has very limited amounts.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.920]   It'll be makes sense to be the Pro at first.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.080]   Maybe the fact that it's going to use an AMD Navi GPU would give us a hint.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   Is that Alex considered a high level or low level GPU?
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.640]   I don't.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.240]   I actually am not that familiar with it.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.200]   So I'm not sure.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.480]   I think that's just a generation.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.600]   I don't think that's the power level.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.680]   I think that's just their latest generation of graphics.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.760]   It's a Radeon or it's not a Radeon.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.960]   I would get Navi.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.480]   I would get this as a Pro level.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.520]   This is a Pro level.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.960]   They're not going to do the base one this way.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.000]   I don't think.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.200]   The man do I want one?
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:47.440]   Navi's and my heart include the Radeon RX 5700, the 5600 XT,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.800]   and the 5700 XT.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.640]   Yeah, it's their new architecture for graphics.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.920]   Navi is the architecture.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.960]   They're still radiance.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.760]   Okay, but that does sound like maybe that leans a little more towards Pro.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.320]   Sonny says T2 chip clearly.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.360]   He doesn't understand that everything Apple puts out from now on.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.400]   I have a T2 chip.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.440]   Until they go T3 and then hopefully we'll get Face ID.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:07.680]   Right.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.600]   Which is why I always want Face ID on this too.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.480]   Where's my T3 chip?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:10.880]   Okay.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.600]   So that is relevant in the sense that it isn't the T3.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.800]   There isn't.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.320]   Well, because the T2 has no...
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.120]   The T2 is basically, I forget if it's an A8 or an A10.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.720]   It's one of the earlier generation A series processors adapted.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.760]   And they would need an A11 with sort of a neural engine.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.400]   They needed a neural engine earlier than they could otherwise get it.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.680]   So I think it leverages the GPU to do a lot of neural engines.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.480]   But it does have fingerprint.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   It has fingerprint, right?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.040]   It just doesn't have the neural network that you need to do the adversarial face ID parsing.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.800]   Because Face ID isn't like a one and done.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.120]   It's an identification process.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.840]   So they would need a new generation T chip to enable that.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.920]   But boy, do I want that on my Mac.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.800]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.200]   You just come and sit down and it knows it's you and all.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.240]   Like Windows, hello, but good.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.760]   Hello is too slow.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.080]   Oh, not too good.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:56.880]   It's like secure.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:57.840]   Yes.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.960]   It's not secure and it's slow.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.840]   So it's like why.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:00.880]   And then...
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.920]   And I think...
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.200]   I think one of the number one thing I'm happy about Laurie is no more fusion drive.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.880]   I can't believe they still sold that for you.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.120]   It's crazy.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.160]   It's such a bad idea.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.040]   It's frustrating for users who still have a fusion drive.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:23.120]   I have that on my iMac and it's a frustrating experience to have to deal with that sort of in-between.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.240]   Which I get it.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.600]   I get that it's less expensive but still good but not good enough.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   So again, though, this could be why this might be leaning toward an iMac Pro
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.680]   because are they really going to just eliminate fusion altogether?
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.640]   I think it makes sense to eliminate it on the Pro models
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:46.720]   but to keep the prices down, I'm not sure they're ready to eliminate that on the non-Pro models.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.760]   So I don't know.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   You know, we might still be having iMacs with fusion drives all along.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.560]   So we'll see.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.880]   They're still the low cost and so maybe they will have that.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.000]   It's such a bad idea. The idea was you have a little tiny...
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.600]   It was back from the days when SSDs were expensive.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.880]   It was a great idea.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.080]   Terrible implementation.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.280]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.600]   You had tiny SSD, a big spinning disk.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.760]   You got the capacity of an old spinning disk.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.000]   And theoretically, you got the speed in some cases of the SSD
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.600]   but it never really delivered.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.240]   And for less money because SSDs were so expensive.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.440]   That's really why they do.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.280]   But I think that those days are long gone.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   So forget, especially if you have a T2 in there, which is the disk controller.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.520]   It just seems sensible to just have a good SSD in there
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.240]   and let people hang as much external storage off the back.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:32.800]   You want to.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.000]   That's one advantage.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.080]   That's one reason I love Thunderbolt 3.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.200]   Thunderbolt 3 means I can have a full speed external drive.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.800]   If I don't mind spending thousands of dollars for it.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.720]   That's all I've got to come down to.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.680]   A lot of this stuff's like...
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.800]   It reminds me of the old scams where all CDs will be cheaper
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.880]   than cassettes just wait and like it never happens.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   Like the only promise you the new thing will be cheaper
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.360]   ends up being triple the price and going down to double the price.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.920]   You know, actually I would argue that today,
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:04.800]   today a tape is probably more expensive than a CD because tapes are kind of obsolete and rare
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.600]   and vintage.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.480]   They're hipster man.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.000]   They were tapes.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.240]   Tapes were half the cost of CDs back in the early 90s.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.200]   But we're talking about 20.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   I think if I remember correctly, it was 21 cents a unit versus
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.120]   44 cents a unit for the CDs.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.320]   And that's 1990 prices.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.760]   And so CDs were twice as much money.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:37.520]   They somehow decided to multiply that out to twice as much money on the end user cost,
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.280]   even though it's twice as much.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.600]   The delta was 20 cents between the production cost between CDs and cassettes
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.520]   even in the early 90s at their height.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.680]   And this is why this is what created Napster.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   [laughter]
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.680]   Just like, you know, just that they just, it was just highway robbery.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.000]   We need the now is good time to be in the recognizes.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.880]   So do you think this will replace the existing iMac?
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.320]   I hope it doesn't iMac Pro.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.120]   Because I just, I spent $7,000 on an iMac Pro.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.600]   I don't.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.640]   But they're not going to take it away.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.480]   So like this is the same thing with the RMac.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.080]   There's a bunch of people who are like,
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.400]   oh, I should wait and not buy an RMac now.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.640]   And no, like if you use the software,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.840]   if you're like in production,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.280]   everything works on the current generation stuff beautifully.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.320]   There's all the next one is going to be a Revé board.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.080]   Unless you're an early adopter and you're,
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.200]   and you have like a little bit of pain that you're willing to take,
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.960]   buy the last and best of the current instead of the first,
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.880]   and probably worst of the next thing.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.800]   So all of the people with iMac Pro,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.480]   those are going to be great for a while now.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.880]   Let people like me and probably Leo,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.600]   maybe Alex, buy whatever comes next.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.880]   And we'll tell you how well it works.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.040]   And then in a year or two, you'll be happy to buy one.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.920]   That's really stable.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.240]   I love my iMac Pro,
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.320]   except for all the Zoom, big blue button,
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.840]   bozo stuff I have had to install on it over the years.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.320]   But it's nicely configured.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.800]   I have to say, I have no use for the speed
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.160]   as we talked about last week.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.680]   But I like it.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.480]   It's pretty.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.720]   Not a great display.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.560]   And if this hadn't snapped any LED,
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.360]   it'll be phenomenal.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.240]   I can't see an XDR.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.920]   But you know what it's going to get me?
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.160]   It's going to get the bezel this display is going to get me.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.240]   It's going to be the X-word.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.040]   I know what you mean.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.080]   It's going to be the color.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.600]   Like, it's going to look better than real life.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.720]   It's going to make you want to live.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.200]   And the first time when we went to that first Apple event,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.600]   where they announced the 5K iMac for the first time,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.920]   it was like, OK, this screen looks better than my real life.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.080]   And then they added a P3 color gamemode.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.040]   I'm like, OK, now it's way better than my real life.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.320]   I just want to go inside and in there.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.200]   And they keep doing that.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.440]   And I think that you're going to see--
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   I mean, I don't know if this one's going to have it or not.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.360]   But we are moving very quickly towards the 128K, 120
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.600]   frame per second HDR, which I've said before.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.720]   And every time Apple looks like it's getting close to a new monitor,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.000]   or a new iMac, or whatever, I go, well, maybe this is the one
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:02.720]   that we see that--
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.000]   10-bit color, Alex.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.560]   Move.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.040]   10-bit.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.760]   And it just--
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.400]   It's a display.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.360]   Because when you see--
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:12.640]   yeah, when you see those, I've seen 120 frame per second, 8K HDR.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.320]   It looks like you're looking into a window.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.760]   Like, it doesn't look like a monitor anymore.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.360]   It just looks like you're looking into another reality on the other side.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.240]   You're not helping.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.800]   You're not helping.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:26.560]   And right now, all the Apple displays do temporal dithering,
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.720]   because they're 10-bit pipelines, 8-bit displays.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.240]   So what they do is change the color slightly in microsecond intervals.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.480]   And our brains just read them as they're being more colors.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.760]   But when you have very small level gradients,
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.960]   you can still see banding.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.440]   And you can see where that happens sometimes.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.520]   And when we get to actual 10-bit panels with peak brightness
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.320]   and deep, deep blacks, peak sustained brightness,
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.920]   it is going to look like another world.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.400]   And--
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.840]   This is all very credible.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.600]   I mean, Sonny Dixon is a well-known leaker, mostly--
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.480]   not so much in Apple space, mostly in--
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.120]   iPhone.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.480]   Usually gets iPhone dummy units early.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.560]   So-- but I think it's fairly credible.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.840]   Just-- this is what you kind of would expect.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.560]   It's just early.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.320]   Like, it seems early to me, but I don't know.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.120]   Like, there have been rumors.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.720]   I always-- I thought the rumors for the impending iMac
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.680]   was going to be a refresh.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.840]   You just get the 10th generation Intel chips
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.280]   very similar to what the MacBooks got.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.840]   This one, I thought, would be pushed off till next year,
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.960]   just because of all the shutdowns that have happened recently.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.240]   But if they haven't ready to ship,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.760]   and it is this next generation model,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.800]   that'll be super exciting.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.680]   Pretty exciting news.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.240]   So a week from Monday, we will--
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.760]   Gosh, is it that soon?
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.160]   Renee, we should be planning where we're going to hang out
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.200]   and have dinner.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.360]   It's such a fun fact that we're not going to actually get to do
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.080]   that this time.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.240]   Which parties you're going to go to.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.960]   No, I mean, like, again, if not for--
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.280]   if not for COVID, Apple would be having to decide
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.720]   what to do with it up at W.D. keynote
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.800]   in the middle of massive amounts of protests.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.960]   So I think all things considered COVID
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.040]   made these decisions much earlier and much easier.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.640]   Actually, that's true.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.680]   Because San Jose has seen a lot of protests.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.120]   You know, I'm sure the McHenry Theater--
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.360]   well, they would do it at Steve Jobs, or would they?
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.240]   It's not big enough for--
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:14.800]   McHenry.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.400]   It's been McHenry for the last few years.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.360]   McHenry, yeah.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.600]   So, yeah, that would probably--
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.320]   And you'd have 10,000 people landing in the middle of the city
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:22.640]   right now?
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.640]   No, this is probably a good thing.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.280]   They might have done it this way anyway.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:27.760]   Who knows?
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.440]   Okay, don't--
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.360]   So you would have had zero time to decide.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.720]   Like, the thing is with COVID,
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.160]   they made the decision to go virtual
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.680]   with W.D.C. months ago.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.440]   If not for COVID, they would have to be
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   making that decision literally last weekend.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.280]   So I would actually ask Alex this,
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.680]   because he has some expertise in these kinds of events.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.080]   Google decided just to say, you know, we can't do Google I/O.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.360]   And that was because of COVID.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.960]   They were going to do virtual, and they said,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.080]   "No, not a good idea."
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.920]   Apple's continuing with the idea of virtual.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.360]   Why would Google not do it and Apple do it?
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.400]   What are the issues?
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.800]   I think it just depends on--
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.240]   I think that Google's, I think,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.920]   their experience is more complicated.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   I/O is more complicated than what Apple does most of the time.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.800]   Apple had a lot more time to think about it, too.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.080]   So Google, Apple hadn't announced anything yet,
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.640]   and they were able to just make the date further out.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.120]   Google had-- the Google was a month or more shorter.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   They have to--
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.080]   And so Google had less time to come up with that solution.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.240]   And I think that--
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.120]   And I think I've said this before.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.080]   I don't even think that conferences make sense anymore.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.240]   Like, I don't think any of them make sense, even virtual ones.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   I think that they're just a waste of time.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.960]   You know, an ongoing conversation with developers or with the company,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.120]   talking about things in a regular pattern.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.160]   It would be more powerful than what any of these companies are doing right now.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:00.800]   You know, the idea of packing it all into one week or three days or whatever
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.640]   is kind of arbitrary at this point.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:09.600]   Did you see that CloudFlare announced a 24/7 TV channel to replace their conferences?
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.120]   So what they should do, that's exactly what they should do.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.160]   Tune in, GeekKit.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.360]   That's the future.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.640]   You know, the end--
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.600]   But they're doing it all--
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.120]   They're not-- it's not an event like for a week or something, by the way.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:28.080]   Nice shout out to Tech TV and a show that it turns out Matthew Prince and John Graham
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.480]   coming, watched Call for Help on the ScreenSavers.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.400]   They didn't mention my name, but anyway.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:32.720]   Okay.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:39.280]   Apparently, he wants to do the MTV of Geeky.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.240]   Yes, of Tech.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.280]   But it's quite a schedule they've got.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.600]   If you go to CloudFlare TV, they're 24/7.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.880]   They're doing a lot of content.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.800]   You could probably help them out.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.960]   This is what--
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.040]   Yeah, I mean, this is what people should be doing.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.160]   You think this is the future?
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.200]   I mean, you know, this is the future.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:57.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.120]   And because there's-- you know, you take out that money that you were spending on,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.080]   you know, a big company.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.160]   They might spend-- the conferences for a large company might be 10,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.040]   15, 20 million, possibly more per year.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.720]   But they're spending on the booth, the travel, all those things.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.280]   It's at least that much money for a Fortune 100 company to support.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.560]   And so you pile that into a 24/7 channel,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.360]   and you can definitely program a channel that way.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   Look at their live shifts.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:27.920]   Look at their live shifts.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.000]   They're doing-- they're actually doing a lot more than we are.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.880]   But they also have a lot of content that they can rerun.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.240]   You know, and so this is a full schedule.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.440]   It started yesterday.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.720]   I mean, six to eight hours of live content is about all you need.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.440]   I mean, that's more than a lot of broad-- a lot of stuff that's on TV.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.360]   Yeah, we just repeat it three times.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:47.600]   Right.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.040]   So there's a lot there.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.800]   It's a great idea.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.360]   So you think-- I mean, this is what-- I think this is the end of the bottom half of TV.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.320]   You know, the bottom half of the-- when more companies realize what--
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.800]   see what cloud flare is doing and do that,
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   which is everybody should be doing this for their own,
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   whatever-- however you serve your market with content.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.680]   You know, and it doesn't all have to be about your products.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.480]   It has to be about the market that you're in.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.880]   You know, like for instance, I think that Salesforce could build a 24/7
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.640]   about how to run your company or how to manage it and all those things.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.200]   And then they get a whole group of people that are just watching it,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.640]   that are likely to buy their product.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.160]   You know, they're building their brand as much as anything else you do that builds brands.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.920]   But as more and more companies go down that path because they don't have conferences,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.800]   but they have conference budgets, they-- you know, if they all started going that way,
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.480]   if they spent the money that they spent on conferences on 24/7 channel,
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.360]   they would get far more-- the ROI would be far higher.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.320]   I guarantee it.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.360]   And so--
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.480]   Matthew's idea, yeah.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.760]   It's interesting.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.160]   Apple development.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.120]   Yeah, and so then--
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.000]   Apple development.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.480]   Apple technology.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:52.960]   Yeah, but--
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   So kind of-- Microsoft does that with Channel 9.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.240]   I mean, it's not-- they don't have a full schedule of stuff, but they have a lot of stuff.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.280]   Yeah, because you know, Warren though.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.160]   They have Christina Warren.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.360]   They got a good host, yeah.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.200]   Right.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.000]   And by the way--
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.120]   But there's no reason why you can't.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   Right.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.560]   Everybody's using Zoom.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.360]   Everybody.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:17.520]   There's the famous Cloudflare lava lamp wall that generates truly random numbers,
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.640]   which is hysterical.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:19.760]   Yep.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.320]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.520]   I was thinking about what Alex was saying.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   In my mind, it seems like it would be more beneficial to these companies to
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.400]   have prerecorded content that just lives somewhere like on YouTube, for example,
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:41.040]   that will get people watching whenever they want on demand, because we're kind of living in a
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:48.000]   world where people are more expecting an on-demand kind of lifestyle and not scheduling their sit-downs
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.960]   to watch something at a specific time that appeals to them.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.400]   Average view time on-- I mean, all I can say is from the zooms that I do every morning.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:04.640]   Average view time on my YouTube, the same content, is about average view time on YouTube,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.760]   I think is about 13 minutes.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.120]   Average view time on Zoom is 80.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   So it's over 80.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.160]   People leave it live.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.360]   I think there's something about live.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:13.920]   That's what we do.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.040]   Our show's live.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.640]   But honestly, our downloads far exceed our live viewing.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.920]   Oh, their live viewing is about 10%.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.080]   They do.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:20.080]   They do.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.480]   But ours is completely-- is generated for that.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.800]   So if you're right, Laurie, in the sense that if you're not interacting with your audience,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.880]   then you might as well just put it up as a VOD.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.600]   And these guys, I don't know how much they're taking people's questions or whether they're
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.120]   really interacting with people.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.680]   They're taking a bite.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.960]   But if you're interacting with your audience,
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.280]   yeah, if you're interacting live with your audience in a fairly low latency,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.360]   like all we're doing is answering questions.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.800]   And so there's a real reason to be there in that process now.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.280]   We do produce VODs.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.800]   So what you really want is, hey, we're going to have a discussion about this thing.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.680]   And then we're going to produce some videos three days before that go VOD
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.520]   that you should watch before you come.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.160]   Then you come and you have this discussion because now you've thought about it
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.960]   and you have a whole bunch of people thinking about that at one time.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.720]   That's a mixture of both.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.360]   So you're right that the VOD-- and then you take the whole discussion
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.080]   and you put it on YouTube and you make that a VOD.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.800]   But there's a live element that a lot of people leave out because it's hard.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.520]   It's hard to do live elements.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.640]   I think people don't get it when they're like, oh, we'll just do live because they see something
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.360]   like Twit.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.280]   And they see Mac Break.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.240]   And I explain to people, I'm like, Leo's really good at what he does.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.280]   It makes it look really easy.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.200]   It looks like we're just having a conversation.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.840]   But this is doing alive.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.480]   Every time I have to fill in for Leo, I remember like, oh, this is really hard.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.680]   Well, and good.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.880]   Somebody noticed it.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.320]   Well, no, they think a lot of those are sequential monologues.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.480]   And you have a real gift for bringing out conversations.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.680]   And it's a huge difference.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.320]   Well, OK, I'm going to put aside all the flattery.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.280]   But there is also a psychological thing about live.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.720]   And I know this from years of live broadcasting, especially on radio.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.320]   Sometimes people, especially now, like the idea that they're not watching something
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.080]   canned, that this is something going on even if it's not the same place simultaneously with them.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.520]   And that's why I think people, Alex, will do a lot longer on your stream because they do
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.880]   as they turn it on.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.640]   And now there are people in the house who are talking about something they're interested in.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.560]   And they can continue doing what they're doing.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.560]   You've become part of their space.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.760]   Well, and in power--
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.800]   And in power--
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.080]   prerecorded never does.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.440]   Yeah, and it empowers the chat, like the chat--
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.640]   Yeah, interactivity is huge.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.120]   --wherenow synchronous.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.200]   You've synced up with everybody that's--
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:35.840]   That's why we do live.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.960]   --and so having the Q&A that--
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:43.520]   And so it's a really-- so I think that doing it live, I think you do have to get really good at
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.040]   making it interactive and having the audience really feel like they're part of it.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.720]   And I think we're just scratching the surface of that.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:56.400]   But I think that a lot of people would benefit from these formats.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.560]   And it can be anything.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:06.960]   You could have a bunch of mechanics at whatever Ford or BMW or whatever it is talking about how
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.680]   they do what they do.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.560]   There's a group of people that would love to ask them questions and talk to them.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.720]   Or talking about to SpaceX.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.200]   I felt like SpaceX, the launch last week, was a monumental lost opportunity for them.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:19.520]   Really?
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.640]   Like just like so.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.120]   Just a massive-- like, well, they-- SpaceX had, I don't know, how many tens or hundreds of millions
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.920]   of people watching.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.520]   There was no interactivity at all.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.560]   And well, no interactivity and really just kind of a lukewarm coverage.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.880]   Like, OK, well, we got-- you got a bunch of cameras.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   Now, I will say the broadcasting of the cameras from the space station and all those things are really
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.280]   interesting.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.920]   But there was so many places where you could have added graphics and explanations.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   And you could have had other-- you could have run for 19 hours while they were going there,
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.080]   having all these live conversations and jumping--
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:52.640]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.720]   --former astronauts and bringing all these people in and talking about it because it was historical.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.880]   It was a historical moment for SpaceX.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.800]   You know, why not make it an event that everyone remembers and keeps them up and they're all part
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.760]   of this thing together?
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.320]   Well, that's what people hire you, Alex, because you need people to understand--
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.040]   So.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.760]   That opportunity-- I'm sure SpaceX was very happy with the number of people watched.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.400]   But they also intermingled prerecorded and live stuff, which is always a mistake.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.240]   And I see the networks do this too.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.560]   And that comes from a terrified fear of errors.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.840]   They want it to all be smooth.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.640]   Well, and I--
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.200]   And they're not ready to do what it takes to be--
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.920]   It's also ready not to have it relatively clean.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.200]   It takes an enormous amount of work.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.360]   And it takes infrastructure and rehearsal and process.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.680]   And they don't know how to do that.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.560]   But they could do it.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.600]   They just need to hire you.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.880]   And then they had CNBC claiming all the YouTubers who paid for the--
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.760]   That geo.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.440]   No, that geo took us down.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:55.520]   Because during the radio show, I had the stream going in a set.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.960]   And at one point, when they actually did the launch, I said, "Okay, we're going to stop.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.240]   Let's all listen to this together."
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.200]   Because it's NASA, which means it's public domain, right?
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:03.680]   I think.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.840]   Anyway, I assumed.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.040]   And then the National Geographic took us and 100 other YouTubers down for doing that.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.240]   They put it back up later.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.360]   They realized it was a mistake.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.880]   That's the--
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.320]   Dude, there's someone not flipping a bit.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.280]   There's a bit.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.120]   The bit when you start your YouTube stream is, "This is my content."
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.480]   And generally, it's on.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.240]   And you just leave it on and you run it.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.880]   And so--
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.560]   Oh, I forgot to say--
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.560]   --we're rebroadcasting somebody else's content and flip that bit.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.800]   All they had to do-- there's one little checkbox in YouTube
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.240]   that you just turn off that says--
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.400]   And that turns off the claim.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.280]   That geo actually--
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:37.920]   Or you can set it.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.520]   --and SpaceX down.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.120]   Whoops.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:43.600]   Oops.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.320]   They fixed it.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:44.560]   Oops, jeez.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:44.880]   It's fine.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.440]   They fixed it.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.080]   These things happen.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.440]   What was that?
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.480]   Oh, I was going to say something.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.840]   Now, I forgot.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.960]   Well, one thing, Christina Warren will be on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.760]   So we're--
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.560]   She's awesome.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.840]   I love Christina.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.360]   Ian Thompson, Christina Warren, and Aunt Pruitt on Twitter.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.000]   This is coming Sunday.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.120]   Oh, the panel.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.040]   Yeah, I thought so.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   Apple has done something interesting.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.400]   We talked about this earlier on iOS today.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:18.480]   They have posted on GitHub the source to--
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.360]   Well, it's not the source code to a password manager.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.440]   It's password manager resources.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.640]   And I love this idea.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.680]   I have to point out that Apple doesn't have a password manager.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.080]   They have keychain and I guess Safari.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.560]   So they're not exactly the experts on password management.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.000]   But I love this idea.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.800]   They're putting up a place that other password managers can go
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.520]   or websites can go to help--
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.080]   They call--
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:53.280]   The resources consists of quirks, which is hard-coded bad behavior
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.480]   that screws up password managers.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.000]   And so they're posting is--
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.160]   You could post your own quirks to your site,
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.080]   or if you're a password manager and you know of quirks.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.520]   Apple's posted a few.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.680]   Password rules to generate compatible passwords,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.560]   because many sites have weird rules they shouldn't, but they do.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.800]   Changed password URLs.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.280]   So if your password's wrong, that URL isn't always immediately obvious.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.960]   Some sites append a two-factor code to the password.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.640]   And so those sites are a little bit different.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.480]   So Apple, I think Apple's done a good thing.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.320]   I just wonder how much the information they contribute is
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.680]   worth compared to the information.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.720]   I'm sure they hope last pass and one password,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.160]   and all the others will contribute.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.200]   I doubt the proprietary password managers are going to contribute much.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   I mean, that's their secret sauce.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.800]   How well they handle that stuff, right?
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.400]   But I honor Apple for wanting to do this.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.040]   Apple has the built-in Safari keychain has become more and more--
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.520]   It is a usable, basic, very basic password manager for people
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.440]   who only use Apple products.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:02.400]   Like if you were brand new to electronics and you got an iPhone and a Mac,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.480]   and it'll offer to generate passwords for you,
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.000]   it'll store those passwords for you,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.240]   it'll sync them between your devices.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.760]   It won't do anything fancy like last pass or one password.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.360]   Do we know how many people use that?
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.720]   I'm sure Apple knows, but--
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:20.960]   I want to clarify a little bit, Renee.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.320]   You're right in that it is a really usable service,
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.960]   but I did have one time when I was updating an operating system on my Mac,
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.880]   and for some reason iCloud keychain, it wasn't loading.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.840]   Eventually, it worked itself out, but I was on Apple's support
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.360]   and was told that this isn't a password manager.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.200]   You should be saving these somewhere else.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.000]   So I think it's important to just call attention to the fact that
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.280]   keychain should not be the thing that you rely on as a password manager.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.960]   I'm sure I'm a sponsor.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.320]   The people who named the studio, the LastPass Studio,
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.840]   would agree with you.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.440]   They do so much more too.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   It's cross-platform.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.720]   There's lots of--
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.960]   The thing the advantage Apple has is the advantage they always have,
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.880]   and that is the depth of their integration.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.920]   They can just get in and hook in everywhere immediately.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.240]   You just face ID, and the stuff is there,
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.640]   and for one password for LastPass, I forget there's a few of them.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.040]   They have that extra step where you have to press the button,
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.560]   and they're supposed to have better access.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.960]   And if all this does is allow LastPass and everybody else
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.080]   to get better integration into iOS,
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.560]   then I think that would be hugely valuable for their users.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.360]   It's not that.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.760]   That's what's weird.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.800]   It's just best practices, right?
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   Yeah, and if you go--
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.600]   It's pretty sparse.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.840]   What Apple has posted is fairly sparse.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.560]   For instance, in Quarks, if you--
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.160]   I remember I mentioned some people use two factors to append the password.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.040]   There's only one--
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.800]   There's two sites.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.240]   You trade in USAA.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:50.720]   That's it.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.080]   It's not this vast resource, but partly it's because Apple doesn't really
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.680]   probably have a lot of that information.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:02.640]   Yeah, they're not doing 90% of what everybody else is doing.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:11.040]   So if you look in tools, there's one tool at JavaScript
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.760]   password rules parser, which--
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.400]   And that's nice, but I don't think that's probably anything particularly special.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.480]   I feel like--
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.080]   All right, I'm going to sound terrible here.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.200]   Do it.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:23.520]   Do it.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:23.520]   Do it.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:23.840]   Do it.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.320]   We're here.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.720]   Do it like Apple's kind of trolling a little bit here.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.720]   Like, here's some stuff.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.640]   Would you like to put your stuff in there?
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.200]   So we can take it in the program.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.160]   Well, they have a project.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.920]   They launched a project.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.400]   I think it was last year, the year before, to try to make
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.280]   what they consider to be increasing complexity of passwords
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.320]   on-- in the web, for them, the web, so far.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.880]   But the web in general, I think they're cooperating with Google
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.560]   and other people to try to simplify it and make it more human for people.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.080]   And I don't know if this is an offset-- an offshoot from this, from that.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.320]   But if there's anything they can do to just make this stuff--
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.160]   Like, some companies still don't let you paste into, or don't let
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.640]   passwords or you inject into the fields.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.080]   And just identifying those miscreants would be a huge service.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.280]   I mean, I feel like Google could add a huge amount to this.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.000]   Apple just isn't in this business.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:12.720]   Go ahead.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.840]   Yeah. Well, and I think the death of Skype in a lot of ways was that
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.400]   they started wanting you to change it every six months or whatever.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.320]   And so they forced you to change your password.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.120]   And then it got to a point where you couldn't remember what it was.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.280]   And because it's in Skype and not in the web, it wasn't going into my last pass easily.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.480]   I had to do a whole thing.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.840]   And so I didn't do it correctly.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.520]   So it literally me starting up Skype for Macbreak, every single time
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.000]   was just getting a new password and just making something up.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.840]   Because it was just like-- and I just wouldn't use it for anything else.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.960]   I was like, this is worthless.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.200]   And I just-- and I wouldn't log into it.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.160]   And I don't think given how few people we run into,
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:52.320]   the reason we're having this drop Skype for our point-to-point connections is because
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:52.880]   we can't--
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.840]   For use of stuff like doing something like Twitch is no one uses it.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.320]   No one uses it.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.720]   And you get to a point where I can't even find the person in Skype.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.640]   Like I type their name or I even type their--
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.080]   The email.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.800]   Exactly what they're using.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.640]   And it doesn't show up on the other side.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.400]   And you're just like, you guys are crazy.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.200]   And so we literally just said, we're just going to throw Skype over the bus--
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.800]   under the bus because we just can't-- so we're in this process of the next two or three weeks
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.400]   getting rid of it for our system that runs a little bit like what Twitch does.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.520]   Because I just can't-- I'm just tired of trying to get a hold of people.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.560]   And that's what it is.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.920]   And the video quality and the audio quality is higher than everything else.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.440]   And I still can't use it because it's too much trouble to work with people.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.640]   That's a big fumble by Microsoft.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.440]   I mean, they're really--
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:31.920]   Massive.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.880]   Massive.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.720]   They owned the world on this.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.800]   And they just-- they bought Skype.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.240]   And they gave them a lot of autonomy, which I credit.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.320]   You know, Skype essentially ran itself.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.960]   They didn't rewrite them in .NET the first year.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.800]   But at the same time, they didn't grab the opportunity.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.240]   They let it slip by.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.480]   And now they're regretting it because they have teams.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.920]   They have Skype.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.000]   They also have a bunch of other stuff.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.680]   They have a link-- this guy's called Link, I think, which is a--
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.720]   Anyway, they have a bunch of technologies around this.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.680]   And Zoom just goes--
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.120]   [MUMBLING]
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.560]   He's it all up.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.120]   Bye-bye.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:07.600]   Yep.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.000]   Well, Zoom-- I think Zoom has the-- I guess--
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.720]   I'll acknowledge that.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.040]   But Zoom is hugely problematic for a number of--
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.400]   you know, move fast and break things, reasons.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.280]   But they seem to have a philosophy that's far more similar
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.640]   to Apple and Amazon than it is to Microsoft and even Google.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.880]   And that is they don't figure out what they should engineer
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.480]   and then hope to make a usable product.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.320]   They figure out the product they need to--
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.080]   the end user experience.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.960]   And then they build the infrastructure behind it to deliver that.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.400]   And we've seen time and time again.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.520]   Like, a cheap usually beats premium, but experience usually beats cheap.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.320]   And if you can get a really good experience, people will go to it.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.280]   Well, by the way, NIST was the one that created that guideline that said
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.560]   change passwords regularly.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.760]   The guy who thought that up admitted it was a terrible idea.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.160]   And this has changed that recommendation.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.840]   Unfortunately, still a lot.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.640]   Like my company, the company I work for for the radio show,
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.920]   still makes me change the password like every three months.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.880]   And since I never log in, but every six months or so,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.600]   it means it's a call to tech support every single time I log in.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.520]   I'm not going to throw anyone under the bus,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.840]   but there was a company I worked for that they started making it
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.480]   so that you'd automatically log out after 24 hours.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.320]   And I think they were moving it to 12 hours.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.440]   And the people who worked there were like,
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.760]   "My uploads aren't finished and you're logging me out."
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.320]   I'm in the middle of a conference call and you're logging me out.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.920]   And I've got a login every 12 hours.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.120]   This is undenable.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.160]   And doesn't make you more secure.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.000]   It makes people break your security more often.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.960]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.520]   And that was the problem with rotating passwords frequently.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.400]   People put them on sticker notes and just put it on there.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.440]   No, but you remember it.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.640]   And that's been the thing for me that's been the lifesayer for LastPass,
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.320]   which I've now used for almost a decade,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.000]   is that I just let LastPass, if it's in the web,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.920]   I just have LastPass generate.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.720]   Just do it.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.280]   I just have it.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.120]   And once you get to a hash, why not make it 30 characters?
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.640]   Why not make it 30 characters?
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.000]   You're kind of like, sure.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.600]   Make it a little longer.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.000]   Because I don't have to remember what it is.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.040]   You know, so, yeah.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.600]   Let's see.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.560]   Why would we take a little break?
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.040]   Then we're going to talk about how you can buy
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.760]   your new iMac Pro interest tree.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.200]   But--
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:13.680]   Ooh.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.160]   Ooh.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.600]   Don't tempt me, Apple.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.400]   Don't tempt me.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.000]   Our show today brought to you--
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.360]   Oh, this is kind of a co-inky thing.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.160]   By LastPass.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.080]   As long as we're talking password managers,
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.280]   let's talk about the best.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.960]   As Alex mentioned, 10 years,
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.080]   that's how long I've been using it.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.440]   I discovered LastPass early on.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.920]   I was using a different password manager
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.640]   and an IcedPass came along, and it was just great.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.240]   And in fact, it wasn't so long after that.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.000]   Maybe a couple of years after I started using it,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.800]   that Steve Gibson went to LastPass's creator,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.840]   Joe Seagrist.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.000]   Joe showed him everything, how it does it.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.400]   And Steve was blown away, very impressed.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.440]   He started using it.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.560]   He's our security guy.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.720]   It's just a great solution.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.560]   And if you're a company, as we are,
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.960]   that uses LastPass, it's been a boon for those of us
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.560]   who are sending workers home.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.680]   Suddenly, your employees are home.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.000]   They're logging into company assets,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.080]   your bank account, your database.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.400]   They're logging into our production system.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.960]   They're logging into the company network.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.800]   You want that same security that you had at the office.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.600]   You really want it when people are using it at home.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.840]   It's always important to have a plan for the unexpected.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.560]   We've been using LastPass Enterprise for years.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.160]   But it's not too late.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.960]   LastPass can be deployed quickly
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.760]   when you need it in the midst of any event
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.920]   to make sure your business keeps running smoothly.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.960]   And then all those employee logins are secure,
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.320]   no matter where they're from.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.280]   They do a number of things.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.520]   Of course, we talked about the password management.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.080]   Enterprise-grade password management
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.400]   gives complete oversight of shadow IT.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.800]   You've got enforceable policies across all password-protected accounts.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.480]   We require, for instance, two-factor
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.440]   for the master password, things like that.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.920]   But LastPass isn't just a password manager.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.040]   And this is kind of important.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.960]   LastPass has gone beyond that,
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.560]   because we need to go beyond the password, frankly.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.880]   For instance, they now support more than 1,200 single sign-on apps.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.240]   That means a single sign-on is fantastic.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.840]   That means it's easier for the employees.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.640]   They have a phone.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.720]   It says, "Was that you?"
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.520]   You say, "Yes."
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.560]   There's no password involved at all,
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.000]   or there doesn't have to be.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.440]   And it's more secure.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.840]   So more convenient and more secure.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.720]   You get a centralized view when you're using single sign-on.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.240]   So IT always knows exactly who's accessing what and from where.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.000]   Very, very valuable.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.200]   They also do multi-factor.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.160]   Now, it's more than just touch ID or face ID,
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.960]   more than face recognition or fingerprint recognition.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.120]   They go beyond that to do contextual factors, things like geolocation and IP address.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.760]   Again, this gets out of the way the employees.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.400]   It makes them more secure but not less convenient.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.720]   I think that's really remarkable.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.360]   That's tough.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.320]   You should be thinking about additional layers of defense beyond the password.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.480]   Last pass never sends or stores your master password.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.800]   If it can't access your data, hackers can't.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.240]   The data that you have in dev vault is precious.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.440]   It's only encrypted and decrypted on your device.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.680]   And the password's never transmitted.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.600]   It's using AES-256.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.720]   Super strong encryption.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.840]   Same encryption used by banks and the military.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.680]   So you don't have to worry.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.880]   And every device, by the way,
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.840]   LastPass works everywhere your workers work.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.320]   Android, iOS, Mac OS, Windows, Linux.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.320]   I use it in every browser.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.240]   It's just the easiest thing in the world.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.600]   LastPass protects by still providing a seamless workflow for your employees.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.720]   We're just talking about this.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.840]   You make it hard.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   They're going to put the password on a Post-it note.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.960]   Make it easy with LastPass.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.840]   And I love it that you can share passwords securely too.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.920]   Employees are at different locations now.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.200]   They can't just run over and whisper in your ear the password.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.440]   But LastPass makes it very easy to share a password
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   without even having access to the password.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.160]   You're just saying here, you know, you can have access.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.520]   That's fantastic.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.240]   So employees, whether the officer or remote, have that ability.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.040]   They get secure access to their work applications
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.600]   with single sign-on and password management.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.000]   Even, and this is a nice touch.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.320]   You know, as employees go home, their internet access
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.200]   may be spotty.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.480]   There's an offline mode for LastPass, both for password management and multi-factor.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.920]   So it's just little things like that that make LastPass.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.560]   I must have for this tough work environment.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.160]   We're all in LastPass.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.200]   Can help make remote work simple and still make it secure.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.080]   LastPass.com/twit, if you want to find out more.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:42.640]   We use it.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.120]   We love it.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.160]   We recommend it.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.480]   It's the first thing I install whenever I have a new device.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.280]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.400]   We thank them so much.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.760]   Really, we owe a lot to LastPass for keeping the lights on here at the Twit Studios.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.120]   Because, you know, they bought that studio naming rights
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.640]   in the beginning of the year.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.200]   And little did they know, little did we know how much we would rely on that
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.160]   to keep things going.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.360]   So thank you, LastPass.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.240]   We really appreciate it.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.920]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:18.960]   You will be able to buy a Mac, AirPods, iPads, and more
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:24.000]   with your Apple card interest free for a year.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.240]   I think that's great.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.520]   I think that's inspiring.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.640]   You could continue to pay over a longer period of time,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.280]   but the interest starts coming due after one year.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.040]   iPads, Macs, Apple Pencil, iPad keyboards.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.280]   You practically need a loan to buy that magic keyboard for the iPad Pro.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.880]   The XDR.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.440]   They will have six month payment plans for AirPods, Apple TV, and HomePod.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.560]   I'm not sure why.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.280]   I guess they're lower.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.520]   Oh, they're not lower priced in the pencil.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.280]   I don't get some stuff.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.400]   Well, yeah, that's true.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.240]   Yeah, for some reason.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.280]   Customers will be able to make payments through the Wallet app.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.880]   Charges will be added automatically to your Apple card bill.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.560]   I, you know, when I set up, so I should mention this too, by the way.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.360]   As Apple's starting to open stores, my iPhone failed two weeks ago.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.240]   The video just started going glitching and stuff like that.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.280]   I can barely log in.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.320]   I didn't really want to bring it anywhere.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.720]   Apple sent me a prepaid box FedEx.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.000]   Got it within a day.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.440]   Send it in.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.000]   Got text messages.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.880]   We received it.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.680]   We're working on it.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.400]   We fixed it.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.440]   They got it back to me five days after I shipped it to them.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.080]   I got it back.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.120]   It's working perfectly.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.320]   Nice.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   So by the way, that system worked really well.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.440]   And I got, I'm pretty sure I got a new iPhone.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.360]   I don't, it's a new serial number.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.720]   There's none of those fine lines and scratches or anything.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.400]   It's, I think I got a new iPhone.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   Mine must have really bit it.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.960]   But the reason I bring that up is, you know, when you first setting it up,
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.600]   this is all right now.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.720]   We're going to set up Wallet and I had 10 credit cards in there.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.720]   I didn't want to go through all that.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.200]   I said, yeah, just do the Apple card.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:03.920]   There's nothing to do.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.560]   It just works.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.120]   If I'm going to, why not, right?
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.640]   I don't need a different credit card to use Apple pay any everywhere.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.720]   So Apple, I think, I think they got a kind of,
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.440]   they know what they're doing.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.880]   They got a secret size here.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.120]   And then they made it really easy for me to use the Apple card.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.680]   And now if I buy that new iMac.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.680]   It's going to be a lot harder to pay it off.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.200]   That's going to be a 10.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   I think, I'll still say that I think that Apple is one of the few companies in the world
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.600]   that could open their own bank where people could put deposits in.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.240]   That's what they've done.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.720]   And practically they have enough, they have enough demand.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.160]   We're already doing that with Apple cash, right?
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.520]   So I'm constantly putting Apple cash into my thing because I just don't want to,
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.160]   it's faster, it improves faster.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.440]   So what do you mean for sending iMacs as you send Apple cash or what do you mean?
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.520]   I actually push it in because if I want to use my ATM card at a location,
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.760]   I still have to type my code in, even if you're using it a lot of times, like Whole Foods,
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.920]   you still have to put in your code and I don't want to touch anything.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.720]   And I also don't like the takes longer.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.000]   So I move it to my Apple cash.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.560]   I just move money from my card to my cash all the time.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.240]   I've got $300 or $400 in there all the time.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:27.760]   And so then when I buy stuff, I just put my watch over it and it pays and it's instant approval.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.200]   I know that I won't have to type any cards in, any codes in.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.520]   But there's still a handful of places that even if you're using a credit card,
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.800]   they want a signature, even if you're using an ATM, they want you to still push the pins in.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.600]   And so when you put it to Apple cash, you just know it's just going to, there's not
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.560]   no one's going to do anything.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.520]   It just does it.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.120]   And so I constantly just kind of have a balance in there that I'm keeping.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.280]   So we're already putting money into the Apple savings account without checking account.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:57.920]   That's the interest.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.640]   And so it wouldn't, and I pass money.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.880]   I mean, that's my, when Candice cuts my hair, I just text her money.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.320]   - Nice. - Yeah, I go, thanks.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.400]   And I just text her.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   - So I've been using Venmo, but you're right.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.280]   If you've got it, you just have to have an iPhone.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.880]   That's the only issue.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.480]   - But I'm going to do it as these days, I guess.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.280]   - Yeah.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.240]   - Yeah.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.160]   - If someone has a green text, then you can't send them.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:26.640]   - You can't.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.520]   You have to Venmo it.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.200]   Apple, by the way, will still give you your 3% if you buy that.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.600]   So in fact, it's reverse interest.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.880]   - They're paying you.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   - Yeah.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.640]   (laughing)
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:58.960]   - Now how much do you pay it off,
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.320]   (laughing)
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.960]   - You know, they know, I tell you, this is,
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.520]   they don't break out services so that they know how much business
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.800]   they're getting with Apple Card right right now.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.360]   We don't know.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.000]   - No, it's all glowing together.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:12.800]   - They don't.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.440]   - It's a giant money pile.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.960]   - Actually, why am I asking you Renee?
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.400]   Lori's the one who has to write it all down.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.520]   - Yep.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.000]   - She knows.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.840]   But I bet you this has been a very successful product for Apple.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.360]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:25.680]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.320]   - It's special.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.840]   - And here's why it really, from the user experience,
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.280]   it really is convenient.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.560]   I completely agree with, I didn't even use Apple Pay
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.120]   because I had had a long time ago and an unfortunate experience with it.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.520]   - Yes.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.240]   - And then I got Apple Card and now I ask businesses,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.560]   do you accept Apple Pay, but you know,
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.120]   before I go to pay for things, I'm always disappointed
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.960]   when I find out they don't.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.000]   Whereas before, I was always pulling out my bank card
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.920]   or always pulling out my credit card to pay for everything.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:02.640]   And now I never want to touch a point of sale car thing.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.840]   You know, I just want to like, you know, click my, well,
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.640]   a touch idea on my phone.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.320]   - One more reason to wear them, watch too, right?
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:08.880]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.760]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.240]   - Yeah.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.880]   - And COVID definitely has accelerated the use of contactless.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.360]   - Touchless.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:15.840]   - Yeah.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.880]   It's just, it really, the hardest part I have left,
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.360]   I make sure my watch is ready to do it because of one of my phone.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.680]   Of course, I won't see my face and then I have a mask on
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:24.320]   and there's a thing.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.680]   And but yeah.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.800]   - So the iPhone SE is so good.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.840]   - I love the SE.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.240]   I got to say, I was almost sad.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.080]   I got my iPhone 11 back.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.800]   (laughs)
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.520]   It's like, oh, now I gotta enter my code.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.480]   - Yeah.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.920]   (laughs)
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.800]   - No, I, you know, the only thing that gripes me is
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.480]   you can use the touchless, but still their stores really bugs me.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.360]   - You want to use your loyalty card?
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.080]   Touch yes or no before you can use the pay.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.160]   So I gotta touch that filthy screen.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.120]   - And then I walk, I walk back to the car where my sanitizer is
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.240]   with my finger in the air like, don't that poison stay away.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.920]   - You need that, that thing longer thing that,
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.480]   - The condom.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.360]   - Do you remember that?
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.800]   - Yeah, there's a finger condom.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.920]   Oh no, I ordered, I ordered that.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.960]   That still hasn't come.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.200]   I should have just bought the Chinese knockoff.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.320]   It was a Kickstarter.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.080]   It's like, if it goes in your key chain or you're in your belt
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.280]   and you touch things with it and you can open doors with it.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.640]   - Condectable, yeah, a little, yeah.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.080]   - Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.080]   - And I still haven't gotten it because I bought it on Kickstarter.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.200]   But of course you could have bought for a quarter of the price
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.120]   from Chinese knockoffs instantly.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.840]   Don't know what I was thinking, but I will, you know, the guys,
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.440]   I should check my.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.280]   - By the time you get it, it won't be needed anymore.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:39.680]   - I know.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.080]   - Although it'll be nice because you will be germ free
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.480]   while the rest of us are still turning doorknobs.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.760]   - I thought you were gonna, - You still win.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   - I thought you were gonna talk about the, yeah,
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.440]   I got the hygiene hand.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:50.880]   - Yeah.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.320]   - The hygiene hand.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:52.880]   - Yeah, there it is.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.520]   - Yeah, there it is.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.680]   - Yeah, anti-microbial, everyday carry, key chain tool.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.640]   I thought you were gonna talk about Andy Inako's finger condoms
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.080]   that he was talking about.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.480]   - I have a stack of those in my, you know, medicine cabinet.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.600]   - You gotta remember to, okay, I don't wanna know.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.520]   You gotta keep them in your car, dear.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   You gotta be in the wrong spot.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.560]   - No, I know, you're right.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.960]   I gotta keep them in my, you know, with my bags.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.280]   Like, you know, I eventually learned how to,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.160]   how to remember to bring my reusable bags with me.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.640]   I just gotta remember to bring my finger condoms with me.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.800]   (laughs)
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.400]   - How many times do I say that?
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:28.960]   Oh crap.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.400]   They, uh, this is the other problem with Kickstarter.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.680]   I didn't fill out the survey yet.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.760]   - Oh, you did that once before and you got your--
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.720]   - Every time.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.280]   - Yeah.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.760]   It was the keyboard or something.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.160]   Man, how do I do it?
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.120]   (sighs)
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.000]   Okay.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.440]   So they've got them already.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.320]   Apparently they're shipping them already, but I didn't get them.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.040]   - But not to you.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:53.600]   - Not to me.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.720]   - I still have Kickstarter show the iPhone 4s.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.520]   I haven't gotten yet.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.880]   - Really?
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.680]   - Yeah, there was a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.600]   They just, they take forever sometimes where they don't.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.760]   Or like you said, you miss a survey somewhere.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.080]   - Yeah.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.600]   - It's not a store.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.560]   It's gotta keep in mind people.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.600]   It's not a store.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.560]   - Right, that's true.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.400]   - It's not a store.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.840]   - Sometimes things don't happen.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.520]   - I've invested in my YouTube.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.400]   - I think I've only got--
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.120]   I haven't been 100% happy with everything I got,
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.160]   but I don't think I've ever not gotten what I ordered on Kickstarter.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:22.880]   But I have to look at it.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.520]   I look at a lot of them go, "Is that really gonna work?"
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.240]   - I'm still waiting for the unicorn that poops rainbows when you tweet.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.680]   - You promised me.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.240]   - The guy came to the studio and showed me.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.840]   It was, I'll tell you how long it goes.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.600]   The other studio was the old studio.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.360]   And I said, "Oh, that's great.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.080]   I want that."
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.600]   It has a little vapor.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.880]   - What?
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:54.320]   - It's a unicorn that has a little, I guess, a fan.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.760]   I don't know how it works, but a little vapor creating thing in its butt.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.760]   And it's also got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so it's tighter than that.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.680]   So you could set it up so that whenever you tweet,
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.000]   a little puff of rainbow gas comes out of--
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.400]   - Oh, no.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.240]   - And the--
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.520]   - Oh, no.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.160]   - No.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.520]   - I can probably see why I'm never getting that one.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.680]   - Well, I have a vacuum cleaner that I would like to sell you.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.960]   You must be--
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.840]   You must just buy anything that comes to your front door with stuff.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.720]   - And when Alex says he's gotten every Kickstarter,
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.040]   yeah, Alex, that's just because you don't order stuff.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.880]   - I don't order very much.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.560]   I will admit, I don't--
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.240]   I order very few things on Kickstarter,
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.040]   because I look at them and I just go, "I think that's a pipe cream.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.320]   I don't think that that's going to work."
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320]   - That's not real.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.200]   - I also just think I was waiting for it to come out,
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.720]   and I'll pay more, but I just want to see it.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.240]   The funny thing about the Kickstarter, you order things,
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.640]   and the other side of that has been I order things,
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.760]   and I get it six months later.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.960]   It's like a Christmas gift,
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.000]   because I don't remember paying for it.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:56.400]   - Absolutely.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.760]   - Like it was so long ago.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.240]   Like it just shows up, I'm like, "Well, I don't even know what this is."
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:00.880]   And I can't--
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.280]   I don't--
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.960]   With me, I don't remember that I did it.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.040]   And I'm just like, "Well, somebody sent me something to me."
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.360]   - I got a bunch of backpacks and gear in the mail.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.320]   I thought, "What is this one?"
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:08.800]   I don't--
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.200]   - I don't--
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.480]   - And then I realized, "Oh, four years ago," or something,
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:12.960]   I ordered that.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.560]   All right, back to the Apple News.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.240]   I'm sorry, I'm very discursive today.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:18.960]   I apologize.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.720]   What is this?
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.560]   Apple's new fancy new network connector that you can't buy?
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.200]   - Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:27.600]   - It's your realtor.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   - Yeah.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.760]   So what is it?
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:35.200]   - It's like a Wi-Fi network adapter for use in stores,
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.080]   or in their organization.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.440]   I think all of our just wanted to show everybody,
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.360]   here's some things Apple does on the inside
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.000]   that's fun and cool, but we don't get to buy that.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:46.960]   - This would be great.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.560]   It's got a two gigabit ethernet port.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.600]   It's got a built-in battery, lightning connector antenna
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.160]   that supports 802.11b, g&n, Bluetooth radio,
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.920]   and GNSs, 32 gigs of storage, a gigabyte of RAM.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.480]   I mean, what?
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.600]   This is awesome.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.760]   - It'd be pretty cool.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.000]   - It's just a black bar.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.920]   - $700, like the Mac Pro-Eels.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.120]   - Yeah, that's the best way to do it.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:13.280]   - Yeah.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.600]   - It's funny they don't use--
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.640]   - Another reason to inflame the Apple fans like,
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.080]   "What, it's so expensive."
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.200]   I know, but it does so much.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.840]   - They are reopening stores.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.640]   They've reopened over 300 stores so far.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.480]   Locations in France, Sweden, and the Netherlands this week.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.000]   - But it's not really open.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.760]   It's like you can come by and pick things up.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.120]   - Okay. - Are you a lot in?
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:37.360]   - Yeah.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.120]   You have to do social distancing.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.080]   - Okay, so they've been open.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:40.640]   - They've opened hours.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.520]   They're going to--
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.160]   Yeah, all employees and customers have to wear face masks
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.120]   while in the store.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.600]   At some--
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.000]   You're right.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.360]   At some stores, sales and service
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.120]   are a storefront or curbside only.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.480]   I think that's what it is around here.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.880]   But there are stores--
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.280]   And I think they might also do a questionnaire
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.520]   and temperature check at the door.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.880]   So--
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.200]   - Yeah, I think they've already kind of laid out the plan
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.120]   for people attending inside and it does involve temperature checks.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:14.000]   There was some hope yesterday.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.720]   I was all excited because the WHO--
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.960]   Somebody wasn't the official announcement,
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.120]   but somebody at the WHO said,
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.240]   "Oh, it looks like there's not any transmission
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.640]   from asymptomatic carriers."
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.600]   - Yeah.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.880]   - It's very rare.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.560]   They back-correct on that, by the way,
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.760]   if you read that and got excited.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.680]   Because that would be really good news.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.760]   That would mean you could take a temperature
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:38.320]   or ask, "Have you had sniffles or anything?"
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.120]   And if--
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.000]   And block them, but no, apparently.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.040]   WHO said, "Yeah, well, not really."
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.880]   Apple has updated its COVID-19 section now.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.360]   They've updated their screening tool.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.120]   As--
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.960]   You know, it's funny, they didn't have this originally.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:01.280]   They've added stuff that most other screening tools had about symptoms.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.560]   And you can anonymously share info now,
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.040]   including age, number of existing health conditions,
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.320]   symptoms, potential exposure risks, and the state you're in.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.120]   And that will be not sent--
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.440]   It'll be aggregated.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.760]   It'll be sent anonymously to the CDC
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.120]   so that they can understand better what's going on.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.960]   - They've been taking a ton of feedback.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.440]   Like, they've--
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.360]   Every time they talk about it, they've added--
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:27.760]   They've heard--
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:27.760]   They've heard--
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.040]   They've heard of people who said they've added stuff to it.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.000]   They've changed things.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.680]   It's been a good process, I think.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:33.920]   - Okay.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.000]   - I think they actually work surprisingly well together
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.600]   when they have a common cause.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:37.840]   - Yeah.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.240]   Yeah, good.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.440]   I'm glad they're doing that, because as we open up,
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.920]   we're going to need some systems.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.320]   There are summer colors for the iPhone.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.080]   I'm not going outside, but if you wanted,
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.680]   you could get the summer colors--
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.680]   - Let's get that vitamin C.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.920]   - Then in blue, vitamin C.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.400]   - The orange is called vitamin C, I like it.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:00.880]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.480]   - It's so pretty.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.280]   - It is.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.280]   It looks like a creamsicle.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:05.840]   Makes me want to know.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.320]   - Yes.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.440]   Yes, it does.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:07.440]   - It does.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.360]   [laughs]
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360]   - So there's a C foam--
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.800]   - They don't have it for the iPhone I see, though.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.400]   They only have it for the 11 lineup.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.320]   - Yeah.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.840]   - So C foam, which is, I guess, a greenish,
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.520]   vitamin C and linen blue.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.320]   So, okay, it looked like white initiative,
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.640]   but that's a white light-like green.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.440]   - Yeah.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.520]   - Yeah, it's very, very faint colored.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.600]   - And you can get a matching band as well.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.400]   What is the band?
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.520]   Is it a fabric band?
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.240]   I must be, right?
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.520]   - I know, it's the sport band.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.080]   - Oh, sport.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:36.640]   It's rubber.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.600]   - I don't know, I think I should call them apple,
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.800]   teeny, quarantini.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.360]   [laughs]
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.160]   Winter teeny.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.400]   I like it.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.680]   - We didn't get all the rumors in.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.600]   I don't know if I credit this one at all.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.880]   Fourth generation iPad Air will switch to USB-C
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.360]   while the mini sticks with lightning.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.320]   - I think the bigger rumor there is that,
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.600]   the rumors that Apple's gonna push a lot of the iPad Pro
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.280]   features down to the iPad Air,
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.880]   and that includes the basic design with USB-C.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.600]   The only really weird one in there is that it'll have,
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.600]   it won't have Face ID because that's too expensive.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.800]   It'll have in-screen touch ID,
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.760]   which sounds weird for an iPad,
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.480]   especially an LCD iPad because most of the in-screen
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.960]   touch IDs have used optical or ultrasonic sensors
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.480]   that don't go through.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.440]   At least as far as we know, don't go through LCD now,
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.240]   and Apple's patents are all acoustic based.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.200]   I think it is credible in that Apple has historically
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.680]   taken features from the highest end,
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.400]   and as they've become less expensive over time
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.200]   and replaced by other differentiators on top,
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.840]   move those to the mid-range and then to the low end.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.560]   And for example, this could allow it to be compatible
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.720]   with the Apple Magic Keyboard,
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.480]   which would sell more magic keyboards,
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.960]   and would also make the Pro technology more accessible
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.360]   to people who don't have $700,
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.880]   just bringing that back to the classic $500 iPad price point.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.880]   So I think it's credible.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.920]   I just don't know when,
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.960]   like would it be this fall,
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.120]   would it be next spring?
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.800]   And I don't know which of the features
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.360]   that's like ProMotion probably won't make it through,
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.200]   but they do say it's mini LED,
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.080]   and that makes me think that maybe mini LED Apple
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.920]   doesn't see it as a premium feature.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.160]   They see it like in-plane switching like IPS
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.400]   as just instead of being a product differentiator,
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.840]   being a brand differentiator,
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.680]   all Apple's displays are mini LED,
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.360]   and they're awesome sort of thing.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.200]   So I found it really interesting,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.400]   and it came from a bunch of people.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.880]   - Oh, okay, so credible maybe, yeah.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.480]   - Yeah.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.880]   - The in-screen touch ID though,
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.520]   doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of keeping the price low?
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.840]   It seems like Face ID would be less expensive
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.320]   than a brand new technology being brought to the iPad.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.280]   - It's more because the sensors,
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.720]   because it needs a bunch of sensors
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.320]   where this just needs one little,
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.680]   yeah, it just needs one little.
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.520]   But it just psychologically people are going to say,
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.800]   well, I want that in my iPhone.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.400]   You know, why can't I have that in my iPhone?
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.720]   And that's rumored for only next year is iPhone.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.440]   So.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.680]   - I want it both, because when I'm wearing them.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.640]   - That's what the rumor is.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.280]   - Yeah.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.120]   - For, yeah, if you're wearing the love to use the face,
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:07.920]   if you're using.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.400]   - Having used the in-screen touch ID on Samsung
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.760]   and OnePlus devices,
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.280]   Samsung's never really worked very well.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.200]   So OnePlus is a pretty quick and accurate.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.600]   - Samsung's using the Qualcomm ultrasonic,
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.600]   and I believe OnePlus is using a synaptic optical.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.080]   - Yes.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.680]   - And the problem with optical is twofold.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.160]   One, it needs to light up to take the photo,
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.600]   and it's taking a photo.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.280]   And they try to do a bunch of mitigations
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.560]   to make that more secure,
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.320]   but it's still taking a photo,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.680]   where at least the ultrasonic one
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.000]   is doing a 3D model of your fingerprint.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.840]   - Right. So Apple would probably use the ultrasonic
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.960]   for privacy reasons.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.200]   - Capacitive is better.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.120]   So far, like right now touch ID is capacitive,
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.560]   and that just uses electricity,
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.000]   and it's harder to fool because like,
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.720]   there's been story, and they're better now.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.560]   The second generation and third generation of this stuff
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.440]   has all been better now.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.360]   - They were flailing it with like,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.280]   yeah, or like a forensic, like a prosthetic mold.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.720]   You just take, I think the Samsung one,
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.520]   they just took a fingerprint,
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.200]   put it on their finger and opened it.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.000]   - Right.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.120]   - You know, those kinds of things will always happen.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.080]   You just want to make the barrier of entry
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.920]   higher than some kid with the little chemistry set
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:10.720]   in his basement.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.520]   - Yeah.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.720]   I'm actually most excited about iOS 14.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.200]   Do you think Phil announced that June 22nd?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.440]   - WW-D. - Oh yeah.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.120]   - That's gonna be- - It'll be in beta,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.000]   but it'll be the new operating systems are,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.280]   like that's why they do that.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.240]   - That is, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.360]   - That is the thing.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.840]   The only thing we're sure that they're gonna release
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.240]   on the 20 seconds, the new ones.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.520]   - Well, okay.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.240]   - It'll be a fall release for the iPhone 12
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.360]   for the rest of the world.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.640]   Will they do a public beta?
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.280]   Probably. Will they do it June 22nd?
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.240]   - It'll probably be developer beta,
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.000]   June 22nd public beta within a month
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.160]   later, maybe slightly less depending on like how reliable
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.360]   the developer beta is.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.560]   - And they're saying- - I don't think the public beta
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.960]   will be the same days developer beta though.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.720]   - And they're saying, which is really good news,
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.400]   if your device runs iOS 13, it will run iOS 14.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.520]   Or is that a rumor?
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.280]   Is that Apple saying- - No, the thing with that is
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.800]   that the only time like, sorry.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.360]   - Go ahead, Laura. - I think that's right.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.880]   - Yes. Yeah. Go ahead, Renee.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:16.080]   - I was gonna say the only time they really don't do that
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.560]   is when a technology changes to a fundamental level.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.600]   Like when they stop supporting 32-bit processors
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.200]   or they require Bluetooth LE for all the new functionality
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.440]   that they're adding, but they've been very good
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.000]   about pushing compatibility back as far as they possibly can.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.120]   - Sure. - Sometimes you don't get
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.360]   certain features or certain apps because like,
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.560]   there's no compute power or it's missing a smaller component.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.040]   But you almost always get four to five years
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.120]   of backwards compatibility on an iOS device.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.840]   - And they would be starting production of the iPhone 12 soon,
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.880]   right? If they're gonna get it out and default?
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.600]   - I think mass protection can be delayed as late as July
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:00.160]   before in order to have the standard September release.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.840]   So I think the rumors that I've been hearing in the past,
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.080]   I know there's a new rumor that's out that says
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.720]   that it might be mass production might be starting in July,
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.840]   which would mean the iPhone 12 would be on time.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.960]   But the more- - Broadcom is saying, maybe not.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.600]   There's supply. - Yeah, the rumors that seem
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.840]   more reliable are the ones that are saying that
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.800]   mass production is not happening in July.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.440]   It's more likely August, which means that the iPhone 12
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:26.640]   would come out in October.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.120]   - That's kind of- - I mean, the iPhone 10 R
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.360]   did that and the iPhone 10 did that before, so it's not-
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.080]   - Right, we had a wait.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.280]   So do you think they'll do that same staggered release
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.400]   in the fall where they have one Apple?
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.080]   - I don't think anything will be ready earlier.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.680]   - Nothing. - Yeah, the reason that
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.760]   this is happening this time isn't because one phone
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.960]   didn't get done in time.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.640]   It's just because of the pandemic caused all of the suppliers
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.600]   issues that are pushing it all back a little bit.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.360]   So I think though, I think that they might announce it
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.080]   as early as September, that you just won't be able to buy it
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.520]   until sometime in October.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.280]   - Or- - And you might not be able to buy it in mass
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.400]   until November or December.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.960]   I think that it's gonna be that typical Apple is-
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.560]   - And I, especially to put a bunch of new features into it,
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.720]   it could be very constrained supplies until early 2021.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:17.040]   - Yeah.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.160]   The thing that was interesting to me is I just put up my video
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.160]   on iOS 14 a little while ago and it changed so much
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.000]   over the last couple of weeks and months,
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.280]   like just what was top of mind and what I thought was most needed.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.520]   Like in a few areas, like they have such good facial recognition,
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.120]   semantic rendering, and saliency now is it'd be great to have
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.480]   anonymization built in so that you can mask people's faces or kids
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.720]   if you don't want pictures of your kids on social networks.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.600]   Or if you have to post something and there's license plate numbers in it
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.040]   and they used to experiment with things like relay messaging
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.520]   where they would hop, that you wouldn't need to go online.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:57.120]   You could hop between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct connections
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.680]   and that's great if you don't want to be on the network,
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.240]   but also if the network goes down and you still need to,
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.800]   like in your caught somewhere and you still need to get messages out.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.320]   I think there's just a ton of stuff that may not make it into iOS 14,
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.680]   but I think given the world we're all inheriting right now,
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.800]   it would be really great if Apple could start to prioritize.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:22.320]   Tim Cook, beautiful, I thought, sentiments posted on the Apple site
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.080]   about the protests in Black Lives Matter and committed Apple
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.360]   to doing better. So did Sachin Adele. We talked about that on Sunday.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.320]   And maybe this is step one of doing better. The Apple,
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:40.080]   if you go to the Apple Maps outside Lafayette Square and you zoom in a little bit,
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.720]   you see they've already updated it so that you can see,
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:47.280]   well, maybe not. Wait a minute, I thought they had.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.920]   So that you could see the Black Lives Matter mural.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:54.000]   Maybe I'm on the web that I can't see it, so that's probably what it is.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.680]   Here it is. Let's go back.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.680]   Well, you're on Google Maps, right?
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.640]   Oh, is that what happened?
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.680]   I think it's Apple Maps that did.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.640]   Oh, my Google Maps dummy. That's because I'm on a link.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.920]   Did it as well though?
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.000]   I'm on a Linux box. Here it is. And here's from 9 to 5 Mac. Here's the image.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.680]   Yeah, watch Google Maps when I click the link.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:16.320]   So this was painted on the street not so long ago, but they were.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.360]   Right. It was less than a week ago.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.160]   Yeah. That went up.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.240]   Yeah. This is really quick.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:26.400]   So that's interesting. So Apple has, I guess these are all satellite images.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.800]   Apple has these images and probably has some update schedule.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.280]   But it seems like when I look at my house, it looks like it's a year or two ago.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:44.480]   Yeah, at least for me, it's usually about nine months to a year.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.920]   Yeah. I think it very much depends on where you're at.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.880]   So I think that in urban areas, a lot of these maps are updated.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.840]   Well, are updated pretty often because the urban areas update very often.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:59.600]   But if you're out in the middle of nowhere, it's a lower number of people that are looking at it.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.960]   So it doesn't make sense to cover it as fast.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:08.480]   I agree with that, but I live in a major metropolis.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.040]   And we don't get updated.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.720]   People in Sacramento think they live in a major metropolis.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.560]   Isn't it the capital?
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.720]   I would say I would cut it off.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.680]   There's a lot of attention. In general, there's a lot of attention to the top 20 markets.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.760]   I don't know whether Sacramento is a top 20 market or not.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.560]   I know, I know.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.640]   But I like to think of myself as big and important, but I know we're not.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.160]   I like to take capital out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.960]   I got to point out Albany is the state capital of New York.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.080]   I don't know what that is.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:45.040]   You would think LA would be the state capital of California and New York City.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:45.520]   Why?
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.200]   I think it was just fine.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.600]   My kids love Sacramento.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.520]   Oh, the train museum, baby.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.840]   So I was up there all the time and they, so I was up there like, I don't know, 50 days last year.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.040]   And my kids came up a couple of times.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:08.240]   So it didn't register for me that you lived in Sacramento.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.040]   There were a couple of people, you and Chris Fenwick and a couple of other folks that I didn't
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.040]   realize were in Sacramento.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:13.920]   I don't know why.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.600]   I just thought you were somewhere else in my head.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.360]   And then when I found out, I didn't say anything because I was embarrassed that I hadn't like hung out.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.200]   You know, and so we're going to meet up at the train museum next time you're in Sacramento.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:23.680]   Okay.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:23.920]   Okay.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.320]   Sounds good.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.280]   But my kids love it.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.200]   It's a great, they went to Old Town.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.000]   They had a great time and so they'd come up a little, but I was spending a lot of time.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.360]   And you can take Amtrak to Sacramento, Alex.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.960]   It's really fun to take the train up there.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.120]   I really use the drive to San Jose for WDC.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.800]   It's pleasant.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:43.280]   It's wonderful.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.560]   Yeah, no driving.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.440]   I love trains.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.480]   I love trains too.
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.360]   We took Amtrak from here.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:57.040]   It's actually from Oakland, I guess, to Reno for New Year's Eve, one of our last trips.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.280]   I would stack all my meetings on the East Coast just along along Amtrak.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:09.120]   It's so, you know, I'd go to Boston or all the way down to DC and anywhere in between.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.080]   Anything that I could walk to from there was kind of where I'd stack all my meetings.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.880]   And everyone else goes like, I will get to them eventually.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.720]   Why don't we start with your pick of the week, Alex, as we wrap the program up?
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.800]   So, I do, you know, we do video production.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.760]   And one of the things that you have to deal with with video production is playback.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.600]   So a lot of times we're using playback.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.760]   We're using something like a hyper deck to do playback, but we need something else to just play
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.720]   out files.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.720]   Client gives you a file or you have a file for your show.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.280]   You want to have it open, you want to have a close, you want to have something in between.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.080]   And for a long time, we used an application called Playback Pro.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.800]   The funny thing about Playback Pro is it gets into the dangers of ignoring, you know, like
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.680]   building your own thing.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:55.360]   As they built a very high performance engine that was great for doing,
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.840]   it was really good at playing out all the video at any resolution, no matter what you
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.120]   wanted to do for production.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.960]   And so everybody used it in events.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.520]   So, why don't you tell us how you would use this?
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.120]   You're up on stage.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.360]   We're giving a speech and you, as you can see, and then you go to the video.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:13.840]   Exactly.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.480]   Okay.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.720]   Because what happens is you don't put videos into Keynote.
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:19.680]   Like, you don't want those videos to be in Keynote.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:23.200]   So, people have their slides up there, but when they say, "Okay, now let's play,
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.840]   you know, like let me show you something and boom, it plays."
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.680]   Now, that's being played out of, there's a couple different, you know, really expensive things.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.600]   Like, watch out is like 30 grand.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.840]   An EVS is $120,000.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.760]   Most of the companies don't use that.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.640]   And that's for sports.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.560]   All the replays that you see are in that.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.320]   There's Softron has some play out.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.840]   There's Playback Pro.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.040]   And then there's another one called QLab, which I think I've recommended in the past,
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.920]   which is a really powerful playback system, but it's really complex.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.960]   There's another app that actually came up.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.240]   I didn't even know it existed.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:57.760]   And this is an app that came up in my morning, Alpha Sowers, that someone mentioned that was
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.320]   called MIDI.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.000]   And MIDI is a playback app, and it's just simple.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.920]   So, it's a simple app that is also very powerful.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.960]   So, this really sits on, it's really a true Apple, you know, like QLab, in a lot of ways.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:18.160]   It's a very Apple-esque, you know, thing that takes full advantage of the Apple infrastructure.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.280]   But what it does, it just gives you a really easy way to play out video files.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.640]   You can play them out of a, if you have a Blackmagic card or a JGA card, you can play
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.280]   them out of those.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.960]   It'll even do what's called key fill, which means it'll put out of both a
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:36.640]   color and black and white so that you can, it'll key in your system.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.320]   But it'll also just play out lots of movies.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.040]   And it's just a much simpler version than what QLab does.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.800]   QLab has an incredible amount of power.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.120]   These are the two kind of, QLab has really become one of the leaders in playback on the
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:47.680]   Mac side.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.280]   But it's got, with great power comes great complexity, I guess is what I would say.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.640]   And so, it takes a lot longer to train somebody up in QLab.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.760]   And so, we were really looking for something that was simpler to use,
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.040]   and a little less expensive.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.040]   And MIDI is about, I think it's $300, and it's a,
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   but it's a really nice playback system that gives you, it has a lot of stuff built into it.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.600]   MIDI control and OSC and DMX.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.280]   You can have lots of different options for your audio out.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.680]   You can even send it out over NDI, which is useful to send into some editing packages.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.040]   And again, there's a lot of things that, you can have it built in.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.640]   If you're using something like a TriCaster or VMix or Memolive or other things,
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.680]   you can have playback built into these apps.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.120]   But sometimes you want a separate operator on a separate machine,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.040]   doing something for you and playing it out.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.400]   And so, MIDI, I think, is what we're slowly moving towards as our software solution.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:45.680]   You can download it for free and run it for, I think, 20 minutes or 30 minutes,
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.320]   and then it expires.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.520]   So, you can't really use it in the show.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:53.040]   But you can definitely get full featured version to see if you like it.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.960]   Kind of where we're looking at it is, if I want to play out something that I know I'm playing out,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.240]   I'm going to load it into a HyperDek.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.920]   So, I have a hardware play out that's connected to my switcher and so on and so forth.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.240]   But if something comes to me last minute and I just want to throw it into a playlist and play it out,
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.640]   if I want to build a playlist out, and I want something relatively inexpensive,
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.080]   MIDI is something that we're pretty excited about.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.800]   So, anyway, that's the, and it's just simple.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.720]   It just does the thing, so to speak.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.680]   And so, anyway, if it's something that you think you need,
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.520]   you can, again, download it for free and play with it for up to 20 minutes.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.680]   And it's full featured just for 20 minutes.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:32.000]   So, it's, and you can restart it.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.560]   It doesn't mean it goes away, but obviously you wouldn't use it.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.600]   I think it's a genius way of promoting your app because if you really want to,
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.480]   you could work at it for a while.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.480]   But eventually, if you're using it often, you'd be like,
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.800]   I think I'm going to pay for it and just have it work.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   So, anyway, it's good.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:50.400]   It's a really cool app and really simple, well designed and relatively inexpensive for what it does.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.920]   M-I-T-T-I from imot.com.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.520]   We don't even know how to say that yet, exactly.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.560]   I think they're French, because some of their products have a French.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.800]   They might be from Montreal or France.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.600]   I don't think they're French.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.080]   M-I-T-I-M-I-M-O.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.240]   I-M-I-M-O-D-K-M.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.160]   So, thank you for- -Yeah, I think that they're out of Hungary.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.600]   -Hungary. -Hungary. Oh, you know.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.320]   And I think it's really one- I think they is him.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.040]   I think there's one guy that's there and writes it,
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.400]   which sometimes could be difficult, but other times can be something like,
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.240]   you can see in the other apps that he builds.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.120]   He's probably doing this and writing something that he needs,
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.280]   which is oftentimes a great app.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:31.680]   That's what you want.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.280]   Well, thank you for sharing something I have no desire to buy.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:37.520]   Saving me more money.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:37.840]   Welcome.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.200]   For Lori.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.480]   I don't want to say why, you gotta do a production.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.280]   No, it's good.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:41.760]   It's good.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:42.560]   It's good.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.880]   For Lori's pick of the week, go ahead, buddy.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.000]   Well, this one isn't a one to spend money on, so you're going to get a set.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.040]   Oh, no, this is really good.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.360]   In fact, I know this site, so go ahead.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:57.280]   So, yeah, this is a card, a dot card from, it's from the Black Lives Matter website,
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.080]   so you can go to black lives matter dot com, click on the resources,
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.120]   and you'll find this here.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:09.760]   This is a dot card that's made by a 17-year-old kid who just put together
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.240]   a bunch of different resources that you can use.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.120]   My personal favorite, if you go to the section, more resources,
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.000]   you learn about and then go to educate yourself.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.400]   This is what I do every single day.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.160]   I go to the Educator's Health section.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.120]   The lesson plan on being an ally is my absolute favorite thing.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:35.040]   So, one of the feelings that I was having last week,
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:39.920]   when all this protests were coming out, was I was feeling both a sense of
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.400]   how can I do more.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.520]   It's so big and there's so much to unpack and there's so much to educate ourselves on,
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.120]   that it felt overwhelming.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.960]   And then I also felt this spiraling shame that was sort of
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.640]   paralyzing me from doing anything.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.120]   - Yeah.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.320]   - And this lesson plan on being an ally is where I started.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:06.880]   And it has been so incredibly helpful to me because one of the daily things that you can do,
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:11.360]   for 10 minutes a day, it gives you 30 lesson plans that you can do
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   for 10 minutes a day to just educate yourself and learn more about
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.720]   what's going on in the world and the social injustices and the oppression of Black folks.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:27.520]   And so, the first week that I did it, the lesson plan number five is to send an email to your local
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:32.640]   officials, asking them to defund police or asking them to,
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.080]   whatever thing that you want them to say to them.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:45.200]   By that day, I felt like I had so much more information that I didn't just copy and paste
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.680]   whatever was there. I actually spoke to them with my own feelings and my own heart.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:55.760]   So I immediately felt like I'm doing something better by educating myself because it's helping me
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.160]   understand what's going on in the world so that I can talk to other people more about it.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:06.240]   And that was just the first week. So I think for anybody out there who felt like me or is feeling
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.720]   like I was feeling where I don't know where to start, I don't know how to learn.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.560]   10 minutes a day is a great place to start. And this dot card has been so invaluable to me.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.320]   There's in addition to these little 10 minute bits, there's tons of resources that you can look to
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:27.840]   for just learning how to better educate yourself. There's definitely donation things that you can
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:34.240]   look to. So these are the Black Lives Matter, their ideas and it's all brought together for you.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.760]   And again, it was just this 17 year old kid who just wanted to create something to help everybody,
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.320]   to learn about the issues and better educate themselves, which right now is our most important
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:50.080]   thing is educating ourselves so that we can make some actual changes and not continue to
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.400]   have the same things go wrong. We don't just because the trend is over, I think it says it
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.320]   at the top, just because the trend is over doesn't mean the issues are. And here's a way that we can
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:04.720]   make sure that we continue to keep this goal and keep this ball rolling and make real changes in
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.520]   our society. Love it. It's the URL might be a little bit complicated because it's
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:21.440]   Black Lives Matters. Plural, get it? Blacklivesmatters.card which is to our C-A-R-R-D.co. What a great resource.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:24.160]   Thank you. And it doesn't cost you anything but time.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:29.920]   Yeah. And you can also find it on the Black Lives Matter homepage. If you click go to BlackLives
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.800]   Matter.com, click on the resources. This is there for you. That's how I found it. So it's a little
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:41.680]   easier that way. I really like the education thing. I think that's important.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:47.920]   Especially for us white people. We don't. Yes. Yes. So there's a lot to learn.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:54.800]   Yeah. And there's even a section called racism for beginners. So you can really start from the
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.840]   beginning and really teach yourself and really educate yourself on the issues.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:07.200]   That if you watch John Oliver's last week tonight from last Sunday. Unbelievably good. Wasn't that
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:17.280]   amazing? Very powerful. Especially at the end. Just a little clip just blew me away and it made
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:24.000]   me cry. Renee Richie, your pick of the week. It is impossible to follow Lori's pick of the week.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.160]   That's a pretty good one. I shouldn't have done that. I apologize. I was glad that I got the first.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:35.680]   Yeah. It is so good. Please do that. Mine are quasi self serving, but not really. And I'll explain
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.560]   that. Mostly when people go to WWDC for the last couple of years, Apple has provided pins.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:46.240]   As part of the developer bundle, you get a jacket and you get pins and people love them.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:50.320]   They've been giving up pins for a few years now. But because this isn't in person, they're
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:55.840]   going to be any pins. So an enterprising developer got on Kickstarter and decided to make a set
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:01.680]   of pins. They're careful to avoid what Apple would do exactly because there are lions and those
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.560]   dragons in those sorts of waters. But they have a variety of pins and they asked me if I would be
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:12.000]   part of the, I forget what they call it in Kickstarter, but if I would be part of what gets unlocked as
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.920]   more people contribute. And so there's a pin with my new logo on it and all the proceeds for that
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:24.800]   are being donated to the ACLU. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah. You haven't been unlocked yet.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:31.200]   So I don't know if I don't know if you heard me, but I just I just bought. I heard that.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:38.240]   Thanks. That was me buying right now. So there's WWDC 20, kind of the classic design,
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:45.280]   a graphic tribute. I love this for Craig Fitterege, Air Force One. That's really cool.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:51.600]   There's some you can vote on like the like it was a technophobic Mac Pro screen and just
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:57.280]   there's a bunch of other really fun ones. Oh, that's right. There's the R. R. That's a good
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:02.560]   logo. By the way, did you do that yourself? I love your logo. Yeah. No, actually Simon
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:08.960]   at Lonely Tal on on Twitter, he does the branding for all the standard broadcast.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:12.240]   That's when I was down to broadcast, standard TV people and Dave Whisk has helped out a lot as well.
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:17.680]   That's nice. So it turned out really nicely. And along those lines, everything was closed down
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.080]   for a while. So we couldn't do anything with the new channel, but we're starting to slowly be able
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:29.040]   to put stuff out. And you can now get the same logo on a mug and it is up for preorder now,
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.640]   but there's sort of two cool things about it. One is anybody who buys the mug gets a free month
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.360]   of Nebula, which is the service that we put up all our videos on. And I just did a Buffy the
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:44.960]   Vampire Slayer Nebula original, which is completely different than anything I've ever done before.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:48.560]   So it lets us do things that the YouTube algorithm would really punish us for.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:54.800]   But I had a really hard time last week just talking about tech in general and dealing with
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:00.400]   you know, making videos and the way I decided to sort of make it okay in my own heart and mind
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:04.720]   is that I'm donating everything from everything I made last week. And part of what I'm doing this
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:10.000]   week, because some stuff took longer than others to a lot of the charities that are going on now.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.760]   I did the bail funds already and I've done Jonathan Morrison's. He has an amazing set of YouTube
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:20.160]   videos up for Black Lives Matters and I've donated to both of those and I'll be doing a
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:26.960]   large donation to the ACLU as well. So pretty much whatever I can bring in over last week and this week,
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.400]   I'm not used to being indie, so I didn't realize how different the cash flow was
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:36.880]   from just having a regular job. But if I produced any content or you bought anything from anything
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:42.000]   I'm associated with last week or this week, it's going to go to one of those organizations.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:50.000]   Very nice. Very nice. The store is at standard.tv and of course-
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.720]   Slash for Nae Ritchie. Slash for Nae Ritchie with a dash in between Rene Ritchie and the
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.560]   Pins, the BWD PC Pins, yet another Kickstarter.
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.000]   Yeah, well I'm signing and I should just buy it.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.360]   You might as well.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.320]   Just make sure that you fill out the survey.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.680]   Geez.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:12.800]   Yeah, I don't actually wear pins.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.000]   I've never put any of mine on. I just have them in their perfect little cases.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.120]   And if Apple's made some beautiful ones-
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:25.760]   It's nice to collect, right? You could say I've been all over there.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:28.080]   I wish they would do the jackets.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.840]   Those big lanyards that they have at Disneyland where you put your
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.000]   WWD PC pins all down the front of it.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.040]   I need a pin win.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.000]   I forgot the D23. I forgot it was D23. It's D something and they are amazing.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.240]   They said, "I didn't know it. I thought I'd get the discount for signing up to Disney Plus,
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.360]   but the discount didn't apply in Canada, so I joined, you know,
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:48.240]   just seriously."
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:48.640]   Oh.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.680]   But the amount of stuff they send you is unbelievable.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.640]   Yeah, I was-
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.080]   And the pins were just gorgeous.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.320]   I was a premium subscriber-
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:57.840]   I guess, yes.
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.560]   A member of D23 for Wild 2. And yeah, they send you this incredible package.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.600]   It's amazing.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.400]   What is this? Some sort of Disney thing I don't know about?
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.600]   Yeah, it is. It's a Disney fan club.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.920]   But it's the Disney fan club.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:18.640]   I thought it was the Disney genome project where they take your D23.com.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:21.760]   What is the 23? What does that have to do with it?
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:24.960]   It is the year that Disney moved to California.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.160]   23. All right, see, live and learn.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.200]   Obviously, not a big enough Disney fan.
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:33.120]   I want to mention something.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.040]   Actually, Mike had brought it up on iOS today,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.480]   but it was something I was planning to make my pick of the week this week.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:42.880]   If you play indie games, you might know itch.io, itchyo.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:48.880]   I love this site for simple, fun, weird games play on many of them play on Mac OS,
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.040]   as well as Windows and Linux.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.400]   And they have a bundle for racial justice and equality that is
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:01.200]   mind-boggling. They've got 1,068 creators of indie games.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:07.120]   You can get 1,068 games for $5.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:12.720]   It proceeds to go to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.480]   and the Community Bail Fund.
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:17.760]   Now, I'm guessing you're not going to be such a cheapskate
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.840]   that you're going to go and say, "Well, I'm going to get my 1,068 games
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.160]   for five bucks." So you can add a little to that.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.280]   And they've done pretty well.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.360]   More than a quarter million contributors,
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.440]   they've raised $3.1 million towards their goal,
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.280]   the average contribution, $11.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.680]   I think people are throwing in a little bit more.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.360]   But this isn't... I mean, even if you play one game,
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.480]   most of these games cost more than five bucks just for the one game.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:50.640]   Basically, you'd have enough entertainment for the rest of quarantine and then some.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:51:01.280]   So, Steampunk Airships, possession-based traditional... I mean, there's so many... It's crazy.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:04.080]   It's crazy. It looks like so much fun.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:11.840]   itch.io. They're bundled for racial justice and equality.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.920]   It's nice to see everybody pitching in. Go make a difference, aren't we?
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:21.680]   Thank you, Renee Ritchie. You can find him on the YouTube, youtube.com/renew.
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.320]   Renee Ritchie, no dash at Renee Ritchie on the Twitter.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:28.320]   We will see you again soon. Same with you, Alex Lindsey.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.240]   Tell me when you want me to be there and I'll be there for office hours.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.960]   Awesome. I'll ping you after the show.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.560]   Okay, 090.media on the Twitter @AlexLindsey.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.720]   And yeah, if you go to youtube.com/AlexLindsey,
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.920]   you can see the office hours and find out how you can get involved.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.040]   There's a Zoom link there.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:51.360]   And of course, the fabulous Lori Gill, managing editor at iMorshesOnTwitter@appaholic.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:56.320]   Hold on, I'm buying this bundle for racial justice.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:03.280]   That'll keep you busy for a while. Something to do while you're smoking your brisket.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.240]   Right.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:06.880]   And it's good not to forget because people are starting to go back to normal.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.800]   And for a lot of people, there is no going back to normal.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.800]   So it's good to keep awareness of as well.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.400]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:17.280]   You know, I was thinking the other day, I was, you know, Lisa and I went on a walk.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.960]   We went to a bit local beef farm.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.120]   And I was just, it made me very sad to think that there are people
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:30.320]   who going out the door is a calculus, is an equation, is a scary thing to do.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:33.280]   Just showing up in public and getting to do the things
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:38.160]   that we white folk can do without thinking about it.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:43.360]   For them is a challenge and it's tragic and we've got to fix it.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.160]   And I think that for the first time in my lifetime,
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:51.120]   it's not just lip service, but we really have the national will to change things.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.600]   Really hopeful, very hopeful.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.320]   Thank you all. I appreciate it.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:57.520]   Come back again next week.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.240]   What do you say?
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:52:58.720]   All right.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:52:59.120]   Okay.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:00.640]   Andy, you'll be back next week.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.920]   Run of you will be gone.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:07.680]   Oh, we actually, you don't know this little, but we actually fight with each other the day before
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.040]   to see who gets to be on the show.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:09.600]   Yes.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:10.000]   Okay.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:12.640]   Laurie, Rose, Hambo, and Andy, so you can make it a speech match.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.080]   Can you be recovered by age, Raj?
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:15.120]   All right.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:15.760]   Thank you guys.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:16.560]   We appreciate it.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:17.840]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:22.160]   Ran 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern on a Tuesday morning.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.760]   You can come by and watch.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.640]   That would be 1,800 UTC.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:31.920]   The stream is live audio and video is at twit.tv/live.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.120]   There's a YouTube live stream.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.960]   A bunch of it is a Twitch stream is a mixture.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:39.760]   But all of them are aggregated at twit.tv/live.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.520]   So you can pick the stream that you want to watch there.
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:44.080]   There's a chat room going on at the same time.
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.360]   That's that interactivity thing.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:48.720]   Alex was talking about IRC.twit.tv.
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:51.920]   It's always right in my face during the entire show.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.880]   But there's a lot of great people in there and they're there 24/7.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.520]   So anytime you're looking for some geek companionship,
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:01.360]   that'd be a great place to check out IRC.twit.tv.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:06.640]   We also have on demand versions of the show at twit.tv/mbw.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.960]   Download your audio or your video content there.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:12.240]   Or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.360]   That's probably the best thing to do.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:16.880]   That way you get it automatically as soon as it's done on a Tuesday afternoon.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:21.200]   If you watch asynchronously, you can also chat asynchronously
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.040]   because we now have a forum.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:24.560]   Great place to hang out.
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:26.000]   Every show gets a post there.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.080]   So you can go to the post for any individual show as soon as it's posted.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.840]   This is episode 717.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:34.000]   You go there and you can comment on it.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.400]   But there are other threads going on all the time too.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.520]   Some of our hosts go in there.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:38.720]   I'm in there every day.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:40.800]   That's twit.community.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.600]   Twit.community.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:51.440]   I think we can wrap this sucker up, which I'm sad to say means you have to get back to work.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:53.600]   Because break time is over.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:54.400]   See you next week.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.040]   Bye-bye.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:59.680]   Hey folks, I'm Mike Asargent, host of Hands on iOS right here on the Twit Network.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:03.920]   If you've got iOS devices or watch OS devices or TVOS device,
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:08.800]   any kind of Apple mobile device, you are going to want to check out Hands on iOS.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.840]   It is the best way to make the most of those devices.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.280]   I walk through tips, tricks, and everything in between.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.800]   Plus answer your questions.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:18.000]   So be sure to check it out.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.240]   It's twit.tv/hoy.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:32.720]   [Music]
