[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.480]   Relay FM I get around and I'm sitting in for Leo because Leo is as yet returning from his trip away
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.320]   But don't feel like this is going to be an alien addition of Macbreak Weekly because we have two familiar
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.200]   Faces to join us today. Of course Andy and Ico from the Chicago Sun times wouldn't do Macbreak Weekly without him. Hi Andy
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.360]   Is it okay if I start just start talking about Hamilton musical and or a sci-fi movie? I haven't seen until 83
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.520]   It's kind of weird to be talking to you and not be talking about either of those two things
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.600]   You know, I can't talk to Leo about Hamilton
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.360]   I can't bring it up during a show because then Leo will talk about it for 15 minutes
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.680]   And I feel bad for the viewers who probably don't care about Hamilton, but we'll we'll see we'll see where this episode goes
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.800]   It's muscle memory. I'm sorry. Yeah, exactly. I know it happens
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400]   We talk about that all the time on the incomparable also here of course again
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480]   One of the the hearts and souls of Macbreak Weekly Renee Richie. Hi Renee
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   Hi Jason
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.560]   I'm not used to podcasting with you without a parking lot or some sort of outdoor ice scenery being in this is true
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720]   Renee and I do a lot of podcasting outside of events. That's that's what we do
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.680]   Uh, but we're here. We are instead. We're in the I'm in the studio with your images on screens as we like it
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.840]   Uh, so I thought we would start uh by talking about what I'd like to call
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.440]   Criminology corner
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.040]   You can have a K you can spell that corner with a K if you really want to and this is where we read the tea leaves
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.400]   Renee's got his cup of tea there
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.560]   So maybe he can look at the leaves and tell us what's going on
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.400]   Lots of apple criminal knowledge going on people love to detect what apple's going to do based on small signals or things that don't actually exist
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.120]   Sometimes and we had we have a few items of criminal knowledge. So I thought we would start there
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.840]   Um, there was a mac rumors report that cited some sources that says apple is likely lain aiming for a late
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.000]   October launch of the redesign macbook pro you may remember this as the redesign macbook pro that we thought might come at
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.640]   WWDC over the summer and then that didn't happen so we're looking for another time slot for it and this is one of the rumblings out there
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.320]   Uh nine to five mac also made a report that said that uh that uh apple they noticed that apple changed the time of its earnings call
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.400]   To october 25th due to a scheduling conflict now that may mean tim cook has a dentist appointment that he just can't change
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.480]   But it also may mean something about when they can be quiet and when they can announce new products that are regulations that go around the
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.200]   quarterly earnings reports so
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.520]   Uh, andy and rene. What do you think about this latest batch of criminal analogy? Is it?
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.200]   Mac tober will we finally get some new max at at long last? Are we are we at the end of the desert?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.520]   Well that the the only real buzzword here is that uh all the rumors are that if there's a new mac book is going to have this new oled
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.280]   Keycap screen, which was which would require support from developers
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.840]   Which is why everyone was expecting that to be announced at wwdc so they could prime the pump
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.520]   So it's possible that it was scheduled for earlier and they had it put it off
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.920]   And then now that they they can only release it after they've given a few key developers chance to actually write software for it
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   So they'll have something out when it's out
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.960]   It's if there's one hot button hardware issue in the entire mac community. Excuse me in the entire apple community
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.440]   It's that where are my new max? I have a mac that's four years old
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.240]   And when I bought that it still had the same case as the one I bought eight years ago
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.360]   So if apple's feeling any pressure to roll out anything they got to do something with the mac soon, don't they?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.840]   Yeah, I mean it's interesting to me because as much as we feel this apple feels this this pressure too because they not only do they love the mac
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.440]   But apple retail loves selling the mac. They love selling it through back to school season
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.360]   They love selling it through the holiday season. Those are hugely profitable
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.120]   hugely popular products for them and of course there are all these rumors that
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.480]   For the next generation of macbook pro apple isn't just back bumping the macbook pro every every ultra book looks like the macbook air now
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.000]   Every high end notebook essentially is it's similar to a macbook pro and they don't really stand out and they hate that
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.920]   There's nothing they hate more than just being one of a bunch of similarly colored boxes
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.440]   So every once in a while they try to do something spectacular and once in a while it works
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:01.480]   You like the new mac pro was great at launch has absolutely languished since then but you hear things about OLED displays or beamforming microphones for hay syri or hay commissary
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.560]   or
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.240]   Things like touch ID sensors, which would be really hard to secure on a mac the way they're secured on ios
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.600]   Because apple doesn't control the whole solar con stack from an eight series processor through to the keychain
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.480]   So they probably need super tight integration with intel and AMD and the rumor is that that is just keeps getting delayed
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.600]   It keeps getting delayed if that is true super frustrating because apple again has no control over those component parts, but either way it's
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.520]   The computers now are fine, but if you're charging apple prices, they have to just be the latest specs
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.640]   I don't think there's any way around that it's awfully hard to charge full price for that mac pro now that it's been languishing for a
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.760]   Couple of years. That's the thing I can't I feel so bad if somebody buys me a photo today
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.320]   It's like you're getting an old computer for full price. It's pretty it's pretty rough
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.640]   Now, what do you guys think about the idea of doing an apple event?
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.440]   You know when they had the town hall event in the spring they said basically this will probably be the last time we'll do this
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.760]   And we're gonna move into our new campus, but at that time I think we all thought that
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.920]   Uh that they would they would have maybe these products at wwc and now that hasn't happened
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.320]   Do you think we're gonna get an event?
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.560]   In october and uh, i'm also curious if you think it'll be a big event or maybe they will
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.840]   Bring town hall back out of mothballs one more time rene. What do you think?
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.400]   Uh, I I would love to see an event because I believe that when apple tries to do something different
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.680]   They really need to explain it. We saw the battery case launch last year
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.440]   And nobody understood it. Nobody understood it until the same tech journalist who panned it
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.120]   We're forced to carry it around ces because their other alternatives just weren't as good
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.320]   And if apple can't get up there and make their case then people are gonna look at and go
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.280]   Yeah, well ed screen or whatever new features it has that it'll it'll land with a thud instead of a boom
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.680]   So if they can it absolutely behooves them and we've been to those october events
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.320]   They've had october mac events not last year, but the year before the year before the last four years. Yeah, yeah
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:57.240]   Absolutely the new iMac with with retin the five k display uh debuted there. Uh, it's it's a great venue for those sort of smaller mac centric events
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.920]   Andy what about you uh event this month you think
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:09.240]   If it's an OLED screen, then I think they kind of have to like just like when they said so much so many times when apple releases something
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.640]   You can't just say hey look we've got this new touch sensor or hey look we've got this new 5k output
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.960]   You really they really want to explain why they made the decision that they made
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.200]   And I think there's no finer example of this than when they
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.360]   You got rid of the headphone jack on the iphone seven obviously that's going to be a big
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.480]   Event anyway when they release a new iphone, but it's not enough for them to simply say in two lines of a press release or a statement on the
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.640]   On the website. We decided that we can make better space of this so and here's how we're making sure it's not going to affect you whatsoever
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.800]   They really want to tell the story
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.680]   They apple really is more than any other company
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.200]   They're like storytellers and every device they put out is
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:57.080]   Another chapter in this character that they're building so and authors like to explain why they decided to kill off a certain character and issue
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.760]   Three of eight issue mini series. Yeah, that's how I feel about the headphone jack is that we all knew it was going to get removed
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.240]   But we all wanted to hear what the story was going to be were they gonna be jerks about it or were they gonna be
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.440]   We just forgot. I mean we were gonna make the phone. We knew we forgot something. It suddenly came out of the factory
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   You ever been planning a wedding seating shirt that oh my god. We don't have a chair for the father of the bride
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.560]   Oh, no, we can sit him around that table. Just stick another chair in there and and do a red card
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:31.080]   He'll have his own little room. I agree with you guys that the the major new feature of a key product like the macbook pro is not something
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.320]   I think you anyone wants to release by press release. I know this is a new apple
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.480]   I know they're trying a whole lot of new things. You could try in this day and age. I mean they could do a live webcast that's just them
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.880]   Right don't even invite anybody they could do that if they wanted to honey hypo
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.400]   I mean there's so many things that they could do but it feels like this is the perfect thing for a small scale event
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:58.440]   People don't understand who maybe aren't on the inside baseball like we are in terms of covering this stuff that the iPhone the presence of the iPhone
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.680]   Especially at an apple event makes it huge because the iPhone is an incredibly popular product and incredibly popular worldwide
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.960]   And I love the mac. I'm not saying the mac isn't a great product
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.600]   But the interest in an event that's focused on the mac is a lot less the press interest
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.160]   The streaming video interest in an event like that is a lot less than an iPhone event
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.800]   So it's it would be a lot easier for them to do a mac event even perhaps at town hall on their campus one last for one last ride
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.720]   But I feel like Andy said you got to do the storytelling you got to explain why this oled touch bar exists
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.920]   You've got to explain how touch ID got integrated into the mac and why that's the greatest thing ever that they can do that now
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.320]   It's awfully suspicious those features apple pay and the watch unlock in sierra
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.440]   Those do feel like features that would perhaps be better served to some new hardware
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.120]   That has a touch ID sensor built into it. Don't you think? Absolutely? Yeah, but then there's also another part of this
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.680]   I think apple had think they realized that they also have another avenue for getting their word out
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.760]   We've been seeing over the past couple of years
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   them
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.880]   Choosing a journalist or a media outlet that they've worked with in the past that they know that they're known quantity
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.240]   They have a good relationship
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.720]   And i'm going to tell this story to this one reporter this one journalist
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.680]   And then they're going to tell the story for us over the next two thousand three thousand words
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.800]   Which is not in any way manipulation or anything
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.000]   But rather than speak to a room full of 500 people
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.040]   They know that they can talk to one person and then
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.080]   Because that one person has uh has the only microphone at least for the first day or two
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:37.480]   That's that can be just as an effective way of getting that story out as getting in something that involves
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   Setting up catering
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.960]   Yeah, it is so far what they've done is not do the full rollout that way, but do a lot of the details
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:51.160]   So like matthew panzerino at tech crunch got the story about the two cameras and the and the portrait mode in the iphone 7 plus
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.120]   Right, that was that was one that he did and we've seen that from other sources too
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.200]   Where where they picked somebody to sort of relay the behind the scenes story
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.120]   But it's more like the the icing on on top of the cake of a product announcement rather than being the whole thing
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.320]   It would be
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.400]   Which is not to say they couldn't do it, but it feels like it's more likely that we'll go to that
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.440]   Event and the moment that they announce a product like this
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:19.800]   We'll discover that there's a story there by somebody that's the behind the scenes of why they decided to do the OLED
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.880]   Yeah, and somebody who's probably not us
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.080]   Why they decided to do that OLED display and and what went into the design of it and that'll come from matthew panzerino
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.160]   Maybe or maybe it'll be jimmed out rimple. I don't know
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.600]   Well, you know, it's people all in jiffs. It could be yeah, maybe uh, or maybe it'll be christina warren
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   I don't know there there there are people but uh that sounds like something that they'll do
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   I the flip side of it is that it is such a big effort even to do a town hall event that they decided they decided not to do one last year
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.000]   They did four or five products in a row at the september event
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.600]   Just so they wouldn't logistically have to support a town hall event in october
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.440]   So i'm sure they're looking at it and they're like, uh, I wish you could have shipped this at wwdc
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.520]   Uh, I wish we had a ship this in september, but seriously get piano bar out of mothballs get that place cleaned up
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   Yeah, you know take take drink as much coffee as you need. We're doing this one more time folks
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.880]   Yeah, I think that's I think that's gonna be and the good thing about it is by doing a mac event
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.360]   That is a mac only event for those of us who care about the mac
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.680]   I think it's really exciting that they that they might devote the bulk of oppress event to the mac and the macbook pro sure but
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.720]   Um, all of these products, right? We would hope what do you guys think about? Are we gonna see?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.000]   Um, and i'm max speed bump. We've seen one last year
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.520]   It's sort of going on that cycle and what about the mac pro and the mac mini and uh, and the rumors about maybe a a macbook air too
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   It's the most glowing thing on the horizon for me is what are they going to follow up the macbook?
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.680]   Nothing with because that was clearly a it was clearly a device that we like to see apple make which is this is the device
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.160]   We want to make we're not sure if there's a market for it yet, but boy are we excited about the manufacturing?
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:57.240]   Technique of this boy are we excited about making a system board that is about as so as little as a as a usb thumb drive
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.120]   And then remember that after they did that with the first macbook air a year or two later
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.240]   They said okay, and now here's one that you would actually want to use or they said that's that's more mainstream
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.880]   So i'm really excited to see what they would do with that. Although speed bumps everywhere else would be really great
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   Uh, I really want to see we've seen chapter one of of the macbook. Nothing. I really want to see them develop that story
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.840]   Yeah, the the the adjectivalist macbook as I like to call it that didn't catch on
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.960]   I don't know why but uh, it did get an update in the spring. It's actually the most up-to-date mac that exists
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.040]   So I do wonder if it's on a different time frame and that we might not see anything there until the next year
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.720]   Like a second you a second us BC port. Yeah, imagine there's the headphone jack they could take that right off and put one right there
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.560]   Oh boy, they're more likely to take away your one us BC port
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.360]   Then the article you a second way
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.400]   Good the good news is that the new version gets over a 30 hours of battery life
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.080]   The bad news is that it's a one use battery and it's not replaceable
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.880]   Hot plate every dorm room. It's the most recyclable i've macbook ever
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.560]   Renee, what do you think about this rumor? There's a rumor out there and it's a little bit hazy
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.680]   But it's the idea that there may be a 13 inch laptop update and whether it's a new version of the
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.120]   adjectiveless macbook or whether it is a sort of
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.960]   Back from the dead macbook air that potentially could have us BC ports or a retina display
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.920]   What do what's your read on that rumor because that's an interesting and weird one where we don't seem to have a lot of
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.640]   Detail but it sounds like there might be some product out there that we that we don't know about yet
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.360]   Yeah, I think the original rumor was that the macbook
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.240]   Well, it's gonna replace the macbook air and then sort of anyone who looked at the macbook air replacing the original macbook
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.640]   This is sort of the revenge of that the macbook is back
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.440]   And you have it at two sizes because that seems to be the the scale apple believes they can address the most
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.960]   Consumer demands for so you have one at 12 inches one at 13 point something which is essentially 14 inches
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.040]   And then people can choose between the two
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.720]   And the first one I mean that the the 12 inch gets this rumor of being the man
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.840]   Sorry this this nigga being the manager book because like it's great to carry around meetings and take on planes
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.000]   But it's just not good for anyone who codes for a living or does intense video work for a living
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.560]   It really is you know sort of that executive product
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.600]   And the 14 inch would be similar to that
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.960]   I think it doesn't solve the same problem that the macbook air does which is I can buy a mac for 900 or a thousand
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.840]   Dollars and until that dynamic changes it's going to just be
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.200]   though these those you know sort of apples lamb regini product there
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.400]   Look to the future product that'll eventually trickle down to normal sizes and prices
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.080]   I mean the other problem with the adjective with macbook is that it's just not without the fan
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.000]   It just doesn't have they've got the quorum processors in there and they're okay
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.320]   But they're not the power that you can get even in a macbook air the macbook air can be a nice
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.480]   In there right so yeah, so you've got this weird kind of tweener product, but this is why the macbook air still exists
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.600]   Is it it's 999 that's one reason it exists and also it provides a level of speed that
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.000]   Otherwise you need to go all the way up to the macbook pro to buy so i'm kind of intrigued by the idea that there might be a macbook
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   Air revival a little bit
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.640]   Especially if it also had a retina display, but certainly if they brushed it up and kept it around a little bit more
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.560]   It does seem a little weird. It seemed logical that it would go away in the macbook
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.080]   Which would just sort of be its replacement, but that that may not be the case. I don't know
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.520]   My my wondering is my my wondering is that maybe they're gonna
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:19.000]   Maybe they're decided that the macbook airline is going to be their intel based super portable mac
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.840]   Portable line and the macbook nothing is going to be the arm based macintosh line
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.640]   He said making sure he points out that I have no information that apple is
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.720]   Is has firm plans about switching the platform over to arm at any point
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.160]   But when you open up the macbook nothing and take a look inside it
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:44.840]   Every decision seemed to have been made to my eye to transitioning to creating a mac that could run on an arm processor
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.040]   Very very easily you look at just looking at the size of that of that logic board
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.560]   Just looking at the the way that it handles heat just the looking at the ways that
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:18:00.280]   It's maximized for for battery and they pretty much at excuse me to fit more battery in there
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.280]   The expensive pretty much everything else
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:09.560]   If they have that five-year plan on the whiteboard and they know that at one point in this choose your own adventure story
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.760]   Apple starts to transition the low power version of the max into arm
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.960]   This is exactly what they would do and if they want to be really clear about what they're doing
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.280]   They could keep all the tooling they could keep all the engineering that they have in the macbook air
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:30.440]   And then divert everything they need to do to make arm based macbooks into this brand new platform
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.480]   They've created that's designed to be as similar to a iPad as they can probably make it
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   Yeah, I mean there also is the thought out there that they might partner with intel and make a custom intel processor
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   Which is another intriguing idea?
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.640]   I I guess we'll see there's a lot of again. It's craylonology corner with a K
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.480]   So anything is possible. I wanted to talk about the iphone eight so people are oh, it's it's hard to
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.000]   Wait for it. Yep. Wait for it. It doesn't spoilers
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.800]   Crilogor has a special
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:06.280]   Area for the iphone eight that we'll get to but I want to ask about I was I was too busy airbrushing out people standing next to Stalin
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.600]   That's true. That's true. Where was Phil Shiller when he wasn't on stage the
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.320]   Mac rumors had a story
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   About a report that since we're talking criminal analogy about iPad pros new iPad pros next year
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.840]   And this is an interesting story because they suggest a new 12.9 model
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:28.120]   Okay fair enough a 10.1 inch model so a little bit larger than the existing 9.7
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:35.160]   And a 7.9 inch iPad pro which essentially is what if the iPad mini was called an iPad pro
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.280]   And that they would all be available next spring which makes sense from a timing perspective because that seems to be
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.320]   iPad time now is the spring that
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:49.400]   And there are a lot of rumors about the idea that there'll be an iOS update in that time frame that would add iPad features and that they're sort of
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.640]   uncoupling the
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.320]   iOS development so that iphone stuff can happen in the fall and then some iPad stuff can happen in the spring
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.260]   Renee, what do you think about this prospect of
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.520]   Multiplying iPad pros and a larger mid-range iPad pro?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.120]   Makes me feel like the incredible the fall iPads are pro then none of them are pro
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.240]   They're just iPads again, and I really can't wait to see the 7.9 inch smart keyboard
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.400]   I think that's just gonna be apples best keyboard ever
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:21.720]   But but that aside I think you know it makes sense that those features if they're gonna keep the 7.9 inch iPad around
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.000]   It makes sense that all those features go across the line that we have true tone across the line that we have the at least eight megapixel
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.080]   Camera across the line because right now you have concessions no matter which of those devices you buy USB 3s only
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.480]   Apple's only iOS device with USB 3 is still the 12.9 inch i'm at
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.200]   Sorry, try my just iPad pro 10.1 is interesting if it's just another
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.440]   4x3 aspect ratio
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.520]   It's not as interesting if apple starts experimenting with a 4k display in 69. Maybe that is more interesting
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.160]   I don't know but it seems that three sizes is probably a good idea four sizes
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.920]   I'm I'd like to hear them make the case for
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.520]   Yeah, I do wonder if there's a bezel reduction story going on there too where the 10.1 might not actually be that much bigger
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.280]   But with a much smaller bezel. I don't know you need a bezel hold the iPad
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:14.760]   Hold it from the bottom. Yeah, I don't know you get a clamp and you just I don't I don't even know what do you think Andy?
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   I mean I was surprised by the small
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.800]   Uh, the iPad mini we were wondering like does the iPad mini need to exist in a world where we've got the you know
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   iPhone 7 plus
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.760]   And this suggests this story suggests perhaps it does. What do you think?
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.600]   It's interesting if if apple starts adding more sizes to the iPad line
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.040]   I think it's mostly to figure out what size people really really want
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.880]   remember that we had the original iPad for years and
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:48.680]   We had to be a little bit surprised that sales maybe flattened out once smaller alternatives both made by apple and other companies started coming out
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:55.000]   It's not as though the 9.7 inch was the perfect size was the size that we all had and now that I have my 12.9 inch iPad pro
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   Absolutely adore it. I don't leave the house without it
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.440]   Uh, so I think there's a lot of room for apple to start thinking okay
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   Is the is the problem that we're not giving them the exact right size would be be selling more 12.9 inch or rather top of the line
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.600]   iPads if it were just a little bit smaller and easier to carry around
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.960]   I personally think that there is plenty of room for a an iPad mini because
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.320]   A tablet is a totally different beast from even a large size phone
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   I do have an iPad mini I you basically treat it as though it's the netbook version of my 12.9 inch iPad
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.640]   But it also means that if i'm on the subway or someplace where I don't want to be
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:40.440]   I don't want to be that guy on the train or on the bus or whatever who's carrying this big lunch train looking at it
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   I want to be that guy who seems to be holding an e-book reader or a large phone
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:51.320]   And using it that way so I think there's definitely room for a smaller iPad smaller iPad and I agree with rene
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   Obviously the it's a big big get for them to make sure that as much of the apple line is possible
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.680]   Supports that wide color gamut because you're not going to be able to fully appreciate the pictures that you're taking on this
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:09.480]   This brilliant new iPhone 7 if you have an older screen that's still stuck with the sRGB color range. So
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.320]   It's it's
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.480]   Apple will tend apple always tends to redefine
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:20.120]   What a product means as they try to figure out what people are actually buying I would tend to think that more models means that
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.760]   Three three of them
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.440]   It's three of them three iPads are going on into the product line
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:32.120]   Two of them are going to be staying and we'll find out which one wasn't selling when one of them is quietly discontinued
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.960]   That's that now that's criminology right there. It's just we'll airbrush that model out and we'll never know about it
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.600]   Who is next to Yuri and drop off who is next to Yuri and drop off?
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.560]   Renee made a great point that I think
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:49.080]   People who aren't close iPad watchers may not realize but the iPad line right now is really weird because
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.320]   The 12.9 and the 10.1 have different features like 10.1 has true tone and it has the white color gamut
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.240]   And the 12.9 has the rapid usb c charging and usb 3
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.880]   And so it's like how do you decide you can't walk in mr
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.080]   Moneybags can't walk into a store and say give me your finest iPad because there are a few and I would
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.440]   Not even a rose gold 12.9 days. I mean, what kind of world do we live in?
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.960]   It's savagery. It's madness
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.880]   So I think that's what i'm saying is is it's nothing else in the spring
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:23.560]   It would be nice to see the iPad line sync up so that we all know that the top of the line iPads all behave
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.000]   The same because right now they you know, it's all over the place
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And my I have I look at this iPad pro that I've got here and I love it like Andy
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.280]   I love the large iPad pro, but you know, it doesn't have a bunch of features that the that the 9.7 has and that's weird. It's just weird
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.080]   Um, okay, and not into sorry now
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.360]   You're making me think about all these things if you do have we do the october event and the march event last two years ago
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:53.640]   The october event was the iPad air to I think and the iMac with the 5k display last year no october event
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:25:00.520]   But then we had the update to the dcip 3 iMac that was just basically a press release and some briefings then this year
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.080]   Do we get an update to that iMac?
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.200]   What is it? Is it just a spec bump because Intel stopped making the chips for the 21.5 inch
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   What do they do with that? And then if they update the iMac now what gets updated in what gets updated with the iPad in march
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.080]   Is it just iPads is an iPad only event and you watch bands are there max that they didn't announce now?
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.400]   Like does the mac mini in the mac pro have to wait till
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.040]   There's just it's I don't know Jason. It's so it's such a soap in the air right now
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.160]   And and you know apple doesn't and they hate this apple doesn't control their own destiny here right with the intel stuff
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:38.680]   Intel's delays affect apples business and I think we all sort of think that apple thought it could get away with skipping a product generation
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   For intel and then the delays hit and now they're kind of caught between a rock and a hard place
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.080]   So I know they hate that that that more than anything else that lends credence to people
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.440]   Suggesting to in my mind to the the ideas that apple would take the
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.120]   whether whether it's an arm chip or whether it's taking
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.440]   Main of deal with intel for some custom silicon that apple gets to control
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.640]   But it's still intel compatible something so that they can control their own destiny a little bit more instead of waiting for
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.960]   Intel to supply them because they hate that that is the number one thing that apple that it goes against apples culture is that they build
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.840]   These products and then they wait for somebody else and they're fully dependent on them to make their products happen
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.600]   Yeah, it's really a lot though. I'm sorry. Go ahead Renee
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.280]   I was gonna say we want them on time
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.280]   But then we have to listen to paul thirtle talk about his his surface book not you know burning up his laptop bag
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.600]   Exactly. It's like there's no win
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:36.040]   Definitely not can we do um, okay before we wrap the criminal analogy corner and cast it back into the asheep of history
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.160]   I wanted to give the obligatory iphone eight rumor story a world bloomberg
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.480]   Reporting that sharp is in talks with apple for olered screens for new iphones
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.600]   Uh olered screens, of course. You if you got an apple watch you've got an olered screen on your wrist right now
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.520]   Uh lower power
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.040]   vibrant colors
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:01.800]   Um, not as easy to see in bright sunlight necessarily although apple's working hard on that would be the apple watch series too
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:09.560]   Um any thoughts about olered and moving to olered for for the iphone and you you've used a lot of android phones
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.080]   So what's your take on on olered as a smartphone screen?
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.920]   Uh, it creates beautiful beautiful images
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.160]   And the usual complaint about olered is that well, of course they look beautiful
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.200]   This because they you've artificially increased the contrast you've artificially increased the saturation
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:32.280]   But as I usually say that's why burgers and mcdonalds have lots of salt and lots of salt and fat people like that
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.560]   But it also means that when you're using applications that use colors as a part of the user interface
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   They just pop they really look beautiful
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.320]   So if apple could create their own their own interpretation of olered where it is still color accurate
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.400]   You're not seeing something that is artificially good
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.920]   Uh, I think it would be a very very good deal for for everybody
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.320]   Especially now that apple seems to be slightly easing off their
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:01.080]   Their mandate that all ios features must be as bleak as possible
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.720]   If there is color in the interface it means you're wasting people's joy
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.240]   On the source of joy should only be the things that we design
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:18.680]   Some shades of clay are partially acceptable on a case by case basis. So the iphone's seven seal is what you're saying
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.560]   the the the the
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.200]   What's the ipad?
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:29.560]   Sure super interesting to me because there's also rumors that apple is doing a lot more display technology on their own side
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.680]   And you never know they have like the a series the s series the w series now the m series
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.120]   There's a lot of letters left in that alphabet and that's a really good like their hardware platform
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.960]   Technology team is amazing. So you never know what's going to spring out of out of apple itself, especially when they work with partners
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.240]   Olered is a really really good technology for a lot of things
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.960]   But you know, tim cook has said before apple chose not to use it earlier because it did have compromises
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.560]   And when you look at some of the earlier android phones, you see like pen tile displays
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.360]   Which had a lot of baggage with them or you saw very low life spans on some of the colors like blue
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   Especially and some people were exploring quantum dot as a way to get some of the the benefits of olered without getting some of the drawbacks
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.000]   And it's it's in flux right now and one of the biggest indicators is that 3d touch
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.440]   Which is a marquee feature for apple is currently bound to an led backlight something an olered display does not have
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.760]   And that's not to say apple can't re-engineer it
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.640]   But apple chose to release a phone just last year that is dependent on led
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:28.520]   So I would expect that apple would move on to a new display technology eventually just because lcd
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.480]   You know, they've got the best lcd panels in the world, but there are limits
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:36.440]   They're hitting the end of what else did he can do for them whether they go to oled and they do it in an apple way
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.840]   Or they do go to something like quantum dot. I think that'll be one of the next big screen technologies leaps
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.240]   They make whether it's in an iphone 8 or not. That's interesting stuff. Yeah, olered
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.160]   It is it is pretty um and they have done some work of like apple watch series two
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.360]   It's so much brighter on that llet screen a thousand minutes
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.360]   Yeah, the no, let's not count nits. Let's not pick nits rene
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.400]   Uh, so okay. I'm gonna close up criminal analogy corner
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:07.320]   And I think it's time for us to hear wise words about good friends of ours from leo le port beaming in from the past
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.000]   We'll be back to mac break weekly more with the guys in just a bit
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.200]   The first word from gazelle
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.280]   Great time you're looking. I know
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.720]   Uh, maybe you're looking at a new iphone new ipads might be coming any day now, right? We're thinking in an october event
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.000]   Uh, well, here's the deal
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.200]   Uh sell your old device to gazelle now. Here's the beauty part. You don't know if you want the new ipad yet
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.280]   don't worry
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.920]   Because all you can all you do is you go to gazelle you get a quote and that quotes guaranteed for 30 days
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.280]   So that gets you uh right into november
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:47.080]   Okay, which means you'll have plenty of time to to see if you want it choose it order it get it transfer your data off
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.320]   And then once once you're ready to go
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.200]   You press send and gazelle will ship you a box
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:58.520]   With prepaid mailing so you paid nothing to ship it you put the ipad in fact while you're at it
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.680]   Why don't you go and get a bunch of other stuff get all the gadgets you got all the gizmos
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.320]   And put them in the box
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.520]   And you're gonna get cash you get a check you can get a paypal credit
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.040]   You can get if you if you like amazon if you use amazon a lot which I do
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.560]   I always get the amazon gift card because they bump that up 5%
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.240]   So you get even a better deal. So as we know
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.920]   To review class gazelle a great place to sell your old gadgets. Don't just throw them in the door
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.720]   That's silly. There's money in those gadgets
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.600]   trade a minute gazelle and then
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.440]   They now sell the best stuff they've got
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.640]   Back if you want so if you're looking to replace a phone or you're looking to save money
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.760]   This is a great time for instance to buy the iphone success or success plus lots of availability
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:51.400]   Lots of choice in color quality for every carrier and you get a great deal
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.000]   So if you're saying oh, I want it just like it's new you can do that
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.320]   But if you want it, I don't mind a little gentle signs of use you can do that and save even more money
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.240]   But never fear every single device that's sold by gazelle
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.080]   Is
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.720]   rigorously checked they have a 30 point check that includes not just functionality but things like scratches and
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.840]   Stuff they really make sure that that phone is in tip-tow or tablet because they sell iPhones successes success pluses
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.360]   iPads
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:25.720]   Even Samsung Galaxy phones, you know, maybe get a galaxy phone to replace your note seven at temporarily and then sell it back to gazelle, right
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.440]   Isn't that smart you could do that?
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.640]   Everything is guaranteed to work. You have a 30-day return policy
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.240]   They're not sold with a carrier contract, but they do work with all the existing carriers
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.840]   So that's nice
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.720]   And if you want you can get financing as you check out financing by a firm
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.800]   You just give them some basic information your approval be instant
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.840]   And uh, and then you're done you can also get a 12 month warranty at checkout
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.320]   Which covers not just the you know
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.080]   Hardware defects or software, but it covers water damage cracked screens the whole kit and kaboodle
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.920]   A 12 month warranty for cell phones and iPads that's from assurance solution
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:09.720]   So gazelle really is they you know, they're just getting better and better. They're really improving their services the turnaround time
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.880]   The quality and the variety. I just love gazelle you will too
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.320]   Check it out what he got to lose gaz
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.680]   E-l-l-e gazelle dot com to buy or sell it's got a big gazelle
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.560]   Now back to mac break weekly
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.080]   Thank you past leo your words have touched us
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.280]   Uh, let's go on to the news. How about that?
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.560]   Sounds good enough criminal analogy for now. Let's go into some other news headlines that I think might be kind of interesting
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:46.200]   So something happened yesterday rene rene r you wrote about this at imore apple has changed how it handles downloading o s updates
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.080]   for uh for the the
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.120]   The big versions the big installer versions
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.240]   Uh that uh it used to be one way and now it's going to be another way you want to tell us about that?
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.920]   Yeah, sure so previously, I mean a while ago apple moved how you update the way that you update um
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:09.320]   OS 10 now mac OS to the mac app store and what would happen is you'd get an alert that an update was available
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.080]   You'd press the little button to update and then you set there and wait and it would suck down
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.920]   However, many gigabytes it would need to suck down and depending on the speed of your connection
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:23.000]   That could be you know fairly fast or it could be come back after a long day at work and hope that it's probably done
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.280]   Uh for apps
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.360]   They've had this thing called background download where if you enabled it and I you know for a lot of people
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.320]   It probably wasn't able to buy default, but you have that choice in preferences
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.600]   If you enabled it it would be ping that an update was ready. It would download the update not install it
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   They never want to install anything without your permission
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.480]   Uh, but it would go through and just allow you to quickly update everything
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:49.080]   I should sorry. I should correct that for app updates you can automatically have them installed but for system updates
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.600]   They wanted to make sure that you were aware so it wouldn't like reboot in the middle of you doing a podcast
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.000]   So what they've done now is they've sorry that's nice good. Good. Good. I'm to do that. That's
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.840]   We both have had experiences with other platforms where exactly would reboot in the middle of a podcast
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.640]   Best experience
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.400]   So what they've done now is they've given the same background download capability to the installer for os 10
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.080]   Sorry for mac os sierra
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.720]   So if you're running the latest versions of el capitan either the the opposite latest version or the previous version
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.920]   You'll get this ability you'll see the update pop up and you'll go to install it and you'll find that beautifully miraculously
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.200]   It's already been downloaded. You just press a button and it starts to install
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.880]   They are being conscientious though for people who may be unlimited storage and if you try to save something in your mac
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.240]   Because on limited space it'll just ditch that installer quietly in the background
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:41.640]   Freeing up, you know gigabyte or two of space that you can use maybe three gigabytes depending on your system that you can use to download stuff
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.800]   Or to save stuff in the meantime then it'll just go back to downloading it again when you have enough space
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.640]   So it's more of this sort of background intelligent management stuff and
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.200]   For most people, I think it'll just be a no brainer
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.840]   It's just easier to do but they are giving options for people who want to forbid it on their system for example
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.040]   It sounds like this is a the perfect sort of feature if you're somebody who doesn't have a metered connection and has
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.800]   Plenty of bandwidth and isn't worried about it because then you get the instant gratification essentially
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.680]   It's hey
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.000]   Did you know that sierra is here and then you can install it right then and not sort of say sure
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.880]   And then an unspecified amount of time later
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.840]   It will throw up a little dialog box and say now would you like to install this new operating system?
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.280]   It lets you do it in a moment
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:27.720]   And if you're on a on metered or you're worried about like your download ruining your podcast or whatever it is
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   Then you can you can go to system preferences into the the app store
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.400]   Preferences and system preferences and turn it off and it won't auto download anything if you want
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.120]   Yeah, absolutely again
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.200]   It's a it's a great system I think for most people
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   If you do have concerns or if you're on a production system that you never want to upgrade that you're still running tiger on
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.760]   You're absolutely affected by this
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.000]   But it's one of those things that's nice
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.400]   It's again
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.200]   It's getting the management of the computer out of the way from people who just want to use it
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.840]   And apple benefits here because it makes it that much easier for everybody to get on sierra
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.200]   Which is what they they always want everybody on the latest OS version and so now
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.120]   Uh, you don't have that moment of like well, I don't want to bother right now instead
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.040]   It's sort of like we can do it right this moment
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.400]   You don't have to wait sort of like it's sort of like how ios tvOS have been working for a while now
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.320]   Right and and there is I mean to be clear just like with ios and tvOS
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.120]   They they will ask you and you have to you have to go through the installation steps
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.320]   It's not going to do something in the background and shock you
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.000]   It's the they'll ask permission before they do anything like upgrade your software
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.560]   Yeah, it's only polite
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.400]   true things
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.840]   So another story came out in the last week since the last edition of mac break weekly
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.800]   Which was about apple and
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.320]   Metadata in iMessage now. I've got there a couple things here the intercept sam bittle
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.920]   You may remember him from valley wagon other gocker websites now at the intercept wrote this story that is uh
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:57.400]   Lots of capital letters in the headline saying apple logs your iMessage contacts and may share them with police
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.760]   Which is yeah, it's a really bad story. It's a scary. That's a scary headline and then they're on imore
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.880]   Renee wrote a less scary headline called apple and metadata what you need to know so
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:15.560]   Renee what what's going on here and what do iMessage users need to know about what other metadata is getting logged and what that
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.720]   What that data is what that information is?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.520]   Yeah, sure
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:24.200]   So what happened was a while you know iMessage came out and what apple did is to make it easier for everybody you use and to get really good adoption
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.840]   They they mix it into the sms app and the sms app became messages and it lets you handle sms
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.120]   Which is the green bubbles and iMessage which is the blue bottles pretty seamlessly
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.160]   You just type in the person's phone number and in the background apple figures out if they're on iMessage or not
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.680]   And if they are blue bubble goes and if they're not the green bubble goes and you really don't have to worry about much more than that
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:47.320]   But as a consequence what happened, you know a year later some people switched to android and found out
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.040]   They just weren't getting their messages because they're friends with iOS devices like ipads or iPhones
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.320]   We're trying to message them, but that message was you know apple still thought they were in the iMessage system
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.000]   They were no longer but that message just didn't get sent over sms anymore
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.200]   So a bunch of apple engineers got together and tried to debug the problem
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.240]   And they did that by creating a log and they keep only 30 days because they really only need current information
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.760]   What happened a month ago is of no help to them in problem solving this
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.800]   And as there's turns out there are other problems with iMessage as well
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.600]   So
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.560]   Anyone who's done group messages for example apple security model is very very tight
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.000]   And if you switch devices if you go from an iphone to an ipad for example
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.360]   You can have either a phone number or an apple id an email address associated with iMessage
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.360]   So if Jason and i are on the iphone and then Jason goes home and messages me from his ipad
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.080]   I might not have Jason's email address and then it really doesn't like it sort of knows us from the same content
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:45.400]   Contact but it can't really be sure and so it puts into a new conversation because that's apple security model
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.120]   Or if you know if andes on his ipad and messages me and then goes out and starts using his android phone
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.240]   And that's coming from a text message and it's part of a group conversation again
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.640]   It breaks because it really can't tell if that's the same secure conversation anymore
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.040]   And there's all these sort of issues that they that they believe that an engineering level
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.360]   Nothing to do with lawyers. Nothing to do with compliance
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.040]   Nothing to do with law enforcement
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:12.280]   That they just needed this information to properly debug the problems in iMessage problems which persist to this very day
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.640]   And that that's the story with this but unfortunately anything that exists can be subpoenaed
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.520]   So if there's a court order saying we want all your data all your metadata
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.640]   If this is sitting on a server even a development server apple is obligated to hand it over to them
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.600]   For me that this is an interesting story, but the
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:36.840]   The bigger story is that how do you do bug fixing and how do you do logging in an era where anything could be subpoenaed?
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:44.120]   How do you balance the privacy of your of your readers and metadata is not the data the data of the messages is still and den encrypted
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:49.480]   Nobody has any idea what's in these messages. This is data like what time you're sending it what ip address you're sending it from
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:55.160]   The contact negotiation that's happening that apple's trying to determine if it's an iMessage or an SMS that kind of stuff
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:01.560]   But how do you log any of these things in an environment where all anything that you log might be subject to you know search and seizure?
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.360]   Isn't this a tremendous problem for apples engineers?
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   You're really saying and for any any Silicon Valley company engineer is saying you are balancing user
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:16.920]   Experience with security at every stage that if you collect information it can be subpoenaed
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.720]   And if you need to collect information to make a feature better
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:26.040]   You have to immediately ask yourself could that be subpoenaed because it's not as if apple's creating a trove of information here
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.760]   To do anything other than improve connectivity between devices, but the fact is like you said
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:36.440]   You write the information down and it's a penable at that moment. It is now part of a potential security story
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.200]   And a couple of the info sec writers who i follow were saying that you know
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.800]   It's not just at any time the government could compel apple to collect this information whether they need it or not because they realize that
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.200]   You know mededate exists everywhere carriers are famous for collecting a storing metadata
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.520]   About all the text messages that we send and just that information exists they can be compelled to collect it
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:00.600]   So I think I think the actual story about apple collecting it is a non-story, but I think the issue that it raises is huge
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.480]   Anybody we all need we we all need to remember that uh the the
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:12.440]   most ambitious and far-reaching organization collecting personal information is not google
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:18.520]   And the technology they have for correlating little pieces of information is also not google having the best
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:25.080]   Solutions there and the tiniest piece of data that you have combined with 10 other pieces of data
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:32.360]   Puts together a really convincing picture that you could not get even if you just had full access to somebody's iMessage stream
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:38.440]   So it's this is why I hope that when apple keeps banging the drum about security
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:44.120]   They stop making it about a other companies here in silicon valley don't have the same attitude that we do
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.400]   Because it's not the big problem isn't necessarily facebook or google
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:55.320]   It's your local supermarket and it's your bank and it is pretty much everybody else you transact with and it's
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.280]   really inexpensive devices that can be
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.920]   Installed in the back in the part of the back deck equipment in police cars
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:09.160]   So that simply by virtue of this car driving around on its normal business. It is collecting every single license plate
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   That is near that car
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.560]   Day after day week after week month after month. We really do have to have an awareness
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.000]   It really is like a it's like the the the movie they live
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.160]   Where it's not until you put those glasses on that you realize oh my god. I'm leaking out personal information everywhere
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.880]   I need to get in a fight with radi rotted piper now
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:34.040]   Of course or something of that nature. So yeah, so when you see an article like that that says oh apple big apple talks a big
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.640]   Game about being secure but really all this data. Yeah again
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.840]   That's true of pretty much everywhere and apple. Oh definitely needs to
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.800]   Get get credit for taking it more seriously than most companies do but still bites
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.760]   I mean when you when you say we care about security
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:54.360]   This is the challenge is that any story like this is going to be used as an example of a shocking
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.680]   You know shocking realization that apple isn't completely locked down with everything
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.480]   Which is impossible
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:05.320]   But apple's the one who sort of set themselves up as as a company that is all about your security and privacy
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.160]   And so they do open themselves up to criticism with stories like this even though
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:14.040]   You know again, you could be incredibly private and secure and that product
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.800]   At the extreme that product is not a product that anyone's going to want to use and so how do you balance all of those?
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.840]   I mean radiation is hard
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.480]   You can have all the curtains closed in your house and they can still use an infrared camera and see you and everything that we do
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.880]   Whether it's digital or analog has radiation around it. It has stuff that's streaming off of it
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.200]   I you know, I like Sam. I think he's a gifted writer, but my issue
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.960]   I don't really care about the apple part
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.640]   I mean that to me is an interesting technical thing
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.440]   But like my mom watches bbc and these stories come on and they're they're designed to scare the hell out of her
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.040]   Because apple gets a lot of attention
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:48.840]   So if you put apple and something scary in the headline it the headline is going to get a lot of attention the story
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.240]   I'll get a lot of attention and that's totally not fair to her
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.040]   When there's some obscure jailbreak if you use a chinese app store
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.200]   And the headline is apple security cracked for the first time ever or something
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.320]   Or you know apple's collecting logging information to debug iMesh
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.200]   And the story is apple is collecting information and giving it to that
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.040]   That is totally not fair to the reader
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.520]   And I think at that point is when you actually broken faith and
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.840]   It's it's better to sort of frame this story in in its actual context
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.160]   Rather than just using it as a way to collect attention
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.840]   So I got another story here. This is a talking about apple's bread and butter
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.560]   Which is rapid
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.480]   Operating system updates. We talked about the sierra updater and making that easier
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.760]   Uh, this is story posted on apple insider. It's information from mix panel research firm
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.560]   tracking ios 10 adoption
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.280]   And one of the things that it says is
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.240]   Uh, we've crossed over we've reached the crossover point already
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.760]   It's been
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:48.600]   Uh only a few weeks two weeks of availability and there are now more devices running ios 10
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.400]   Than ios 9
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.120]   You know apple does this fast. This is one of their trademarks
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:00.040]   But it's also a huge benefit for the platform, right that that you can have confidence if you're a third-party developer
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.520]   For example that people are going to be on if not the latest version, but you know
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.880]   The latest version and maybe one version back that the uptake is so incredibly fast with apple products
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.200]   Yeah, and that's part of that is due to the consistency of the platform
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   Uh, where you don't have uh, you have one kind of smartphone and it's the ultra sophisticated ultra high-end smartphone
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:26.920]   They're not selling iPhones and bubble packs to parts of the country where they parts of the world where they don't have a lot of money for phones
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:32.200]   So it's easy to really get everybody on the same page and that's why the the level of software is so consistently high
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.400]   Yeah, and I think it's that it goes both ways too that
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:41.880]   Apple is doing two things with the updates one is when they push these out it goes to every person and every carrier in every region of the world
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:49.480]   Uh, which is not the case with a lot of platforms because they have that non-integrated model and they have to negotiate carriers and device manufacturers and
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.400]   And you know, sometimes laws and individual states, uh, and all that stuff can vary
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.240]   But it also means that when you buy an apple device, you're not just buying the device you have now
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.720]   And we just spoke about it with ios 10 last year ios 9.3 was a really good update
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.400]   Especially for ipad, you know, it had had a bunch of interesting new features in it
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   iOS 10.3 could be the same thing and you'll just get it and you'll be almost certain to get it if you're running anything approaching
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.720]   Apple supporting devices going back to 2012, I think the iflon 5 right now
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.160]   Which is not the case even with the nexus made in the same year
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.200]   And you have both have advantages advantages, but when it comes to updates it's a huge advantage and a huge added value
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:30.280]   And it's especially prevalent in security updates and if you listen to security now, which follows this show steve gibson high
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.560]   Uh, you'll you'll hear every week there's there's ios
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.600]   um
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.040]   There's ios
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:42.680]   Problems and there's android problems and the ios problems apple has been much better than the past they'll push out a point update in
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:47.000]   Within two weeks hundreds of millions of people have that update and that's again
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.200]   It's not going to matter to everybody but for the people for whom, you know
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:55.320]   Updates and security fixes are important. It's it's something that you really have to factor into your decision-making
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.680]   Let's uh, let's talk about some
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:04.680]   Levity i want to bring some levity that this we've been talking about security holes and things like that. It's really depressing
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:11.880]   Um, number one top paid sticker pack app. I love the message messages stickers. I love them
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.200]   I made one sticker gate sticker gate
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:21.240]   Wait, we already had a sticker gate. It was why apple puts doesn't put intel inside stickers on its laptops. That was sticker gate
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.640]   This is like sticker gate two
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:30.760]   electric boogaloo electric sticker anyway, uh, we'll come up with an answer proven to have a consistent problem against stickers
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.720]   I promise to investigate
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:39.320]   The story here is that there is a an app that makes uh
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:45.160]   It's a such a great idea. It's it's stickers that look like iMessage responses
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.760]   And the idea is that when you get phonies
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:55.880]   As it's called you can take a sticker and basically put words in the mouth of the person that you're talking to
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.320]   Uh, and it's a it's a pretty fun joke. So somebody says
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.560]   Uh, I don't know what you're talking about and you put on the sticker that says you're so smart
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.440]   And it looks now to that person like they responded with something totally different
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.200]   Than what they actually responded to now. This is playful and adorable
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.040]   But it also is using apple system font and apple's designed for the bubbles
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.840]   And apparently apple has warned the makers of this sticker pack that they need to change
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:25.720]   Their stickers to not exactly resemble iMessage stickers
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:31.480]   You just know that eddy q is doing this to fill uh shiller and all his community all the group messages with tim cook and jeff william
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:35.560]   Is like phil would make a point and he would just put the bubble on top of it phil would put an angry face
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.600]   And he would stick the happy face emoji sticker on top and just they were getting angry and angry and something had to be done about it
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.240]   Duke stinks
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.120]   How dare you that that that is an interesting theory
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.280]   See all the theories of that app store rejections and other things that we've had over the years from one now
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.760]   I really I really enjoy the idea that app store rejections may happen because
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.960]   Uh, one apple executive is just using apps to annoy
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:00.520]   Another apple executive and they won't have anything
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.600]   Uh, come on phil it's just good fun take it down
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:10.360]   The only way to get phil's shiller to stop using that fart app during meetings is to destroy all fart apps
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:16.200]   So you made laser's now take this rene. I know there's an i'm more sticker pack. I did an incomparable sticker pack
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:21.640]   I think the real question here is andi when is the andi and not co sticker pack coming to the messages app store
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.120]   Please jason i'm glad you asked um here at an outcorp
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:30.840]   Every time we say no, it's as important as every time we say yes
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.280]   We feel as though this is an interesting space and an immersing technology
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:40.440]   But we're not going to produce a sticker pack just to simply say that we have the same thing that other platforms have
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.800]   Here in an outcorp
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.200]   We will be sure to address this when we feel as though we can bring something to this technology
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.240]   So that we can honestly say it's the best sticker pack ever made
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.320]   And now i have a video here. Is there a release date? That's the question
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:01.720]   We don't comment on our non stickers. Oh later this all interesting interesting. Well, I look forward to the in not co
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:08.040]   Sticker pack whenever it arrives any thoughts about the story? I think it's funny and ridiculous and I get why
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:14.280]   Apparently the the statement that was made to the developer was no pranks in the app store
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.080]   It's like like the dean came in and said now now
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:23.480]   I'm gonna i'm gonna send you to detention if you don't stop it with your prank your wacky pranks, but
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.560]   I don't know it seems it seems all in fun and goofy to me and
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.760]   lawsuits they see someone doing this someone else they get any hit with a can of beer and then they get sued
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:39.000]   That's again. This is what the dean warned us about in in every college party movie ever made
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.560]   It's a real genius episode should have been filmed
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.240]   Interesting
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.080]   Interesting, but it's good but it's good that it made it to the app store to begin with apple tends to
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.400]   Apple gets some flak for saying hey wait a minute. How come you let it into the app store to begin with?
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.400]   I do think they have the the policy of
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   We will make sure that our
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.440]   Our validation process is inclined towards letting apps in
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:05.800]   But then that means that when we take a closer look at something or once again, it turns out that
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:11.400]   It's it's only tim cook and one other senior employee at a meeting because everybody else got oh, i'm sorry
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.280]   I can't make that i'm canceling nobody show up. Nobody show up at the restaurant stickers inside apple
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:21.800]   It's it's it's you know, I'd like to see them not actually say no pranks
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.160]   Remember this is this is the no fun platform
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.840]   We we let you have an off shade of green in the user interface
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.760]   Don't make us sorry that we entrusted you with with frivolity
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.880]   It's funny though
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:40.040]   Because they have an unforeseen category which is supposed to cover everything that they're not predicting and they they have fairly good guidelines
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:44.360]   in their head, but they always know that something will happen that they never accounted for and
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.720]   Especially during launch time when everyone is trying to get like their iOS 8 or iOS 9 or iOS 10 app
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.960]   Approving to the store. It's all hands on deck and they're running things through and basically if they don't
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.760]   Crash and they're not obviously like porn or something
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:03.080]   They'll have a high likelihood of making it through just because there's such a deluge of apps and then over time, especially if they become super popular
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.080]   Uh, the people who are actually are running the review teams will stop and look and say wait a minute
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:12.040]   We know this got in but you know, it really doesn't follow our rules and then the people who run the store will say
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:17.240]   Hey, we're making money off this leave us alone and there'll be a huge argument and eventually somebody will win
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.240]   And in some cases, you know friend of the show james tomsen gets caught in the middle and apple
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.120]   Sincerely believes that there's no coder in the world who can make
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.400]   A widget robust enough to have a whole app inside it
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.240]   So they just say don't do it and then hey, I made the doc I can do this and it works
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:37.000]   And there's a huge bruaha, but we get we get actual apps and widgets faster than if we had to wait a year for iOS
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.200]   You know tend to make them official so it's a terrible horrible process
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.120]   But sometimes it produces faster results and I'd like to thank the twitch chat room
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:50.520]   They're brilliant. They just pointed out that what the dean would do is put that app developer on double sticker probate probation. So yeah, yes
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:56.680]   Oh my the jokes they happen. So one more news item I wanted to share with you guys and andi
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:02.120]   I'm really curious about this because I know that you are not a stranger to android wear smartwatches and there was a report
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:11.240]   on uh android police dot com that's a that's a fine mobile related site about uh android wear smartwatches not pairing with the iphone
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.920]   And that google is apparently aware of the issue, but
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:20.360]   Awareness is not enough. We also need to know what's going on here. What do you what do you think do you uh?
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.960]   Do you use an android wear smartwatch with an iphone or do you keep those sort of dogs and cats separate?
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:31.960]   I only have it paired with my uh with my android phone because unfortunately uh they
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:39.800]   Oh, so it's only last year that android wear got opened up to ios and even there you don't really get an android wear or an apple watch type
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:45.400]   Experience you get notifications of course from all apps you get you you'll find out who's calling and what your text messages
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:51.640]   But the only apps that directly supported are google apps because really it's the only platform they can they can control
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:56.520]   And now we're seeing the the bang on effects where you have something that has to be intimate with a watch
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:01.320]   Excuse me with a phone, but you don't have an intimate correspondence with the makers of that phone
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.680]   It is a big deal for people who are using these watches because
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.760]   You look at the list of incompatible watches and it's basically any
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.640]   Any android bird watch that is sold more than eight
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.920]   Including my favorite including what I think is the best
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.400]   I would say the best smartwatch made which is the mode of 360 second generation one
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:26.360]   Uh, so essentially that means that it's the door is closed now. It's a basically a rechargeable timepiece and that's it
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:31.560]   It's too bad. I'm sure that it's it's nothing more than what it seems. It's just an incompatibility
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:37.560]   Uh with uh with the new software, I'm sure that uh, I don't know if google is going to be really rushing to fix this because
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.080]   Once again, they have better numbers than we do and the numbers we have are that
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:46.200]   They're very very few people are actually running android where on i was but it does show that it's it's a
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   It's a one of the nasty things about smart watches these days is that you really are connected to it has to be the maker of the watch
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.280]   Makes your phone, uh if it doesn't then
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.320]   You're either stuck with something like a fitness watch
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.920]   Uh, and or it's something else that has a very limited functionality
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.160]   It's like those early episodes in the original star trek when the enterprise disappeared in the shuttle
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.480]   It was just stuck out there in space hoping and praying that the enterprise would come back and find it
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.560]   Uh and android where I mean google
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.560]   Famously last week also delayed android where the next version until next year
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.160]   Yeah android where too and it just goes to show watches are not easy
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.320]   I mean it's easier to sit here and criticize and say they're not selling that many where the software is not perfect yet
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.640]   But the risk computers is a whole new thing and we're all sort of discovering it together
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:32.600]   Yeah, exactly right and uh and you're right. This is a little bit the star trek analogy. I rene
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.280]   I think might be that if you're in a uh like a cling on shuttlecraft
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   You may not be
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.760]   Expecting a federation ship to pick you up and that's sort of like this match here makes it that much
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.520]   Weird the other way around yeah, or the other way around that's right fair play fair play
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.640]   It's just a seed
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.400]   It's it's great that android where the google made the effort to get android where to work with ios at all
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.120]   But it is so limited and there the the experience isn't nearly as rich as it is on android
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:01.320]   And so it feels like I love that they are they are making it compact as compatible as they can
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:04.120]   But it's still gotta be a tiny fraction of the actual use
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.600]   The good news is that your custom one the nicest features of android where compared to apple watch
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:13.160]   The custom watch faces those will again will still work as a wristwatch
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:19.240]   So if you still have your rocket ship watch or the watch in which the kitty goes to sleep at night and we accept in the morning
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.960]   You'll still you'll still have your kitty. That's right. The number one feature of any smartwatch
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   And I will fight somebody who says different is
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.040]   Uh, it needs to tell the time right?
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.800]   I mean number one please tell the time otherwise, you know what you're not you're not a watch
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:36.760]   If you can tell the time so because like we all the iPhone was originally seriously a phone and all the smart
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.880]   More like the trio and blackberry blackberry had a hardware hang up and answer buttons
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.760]   Because it was such a phone and now the phone is sort of an app that annoys us as often as it pleases us
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.680]   And I wonder if like five years from now are we gonna say oh, it's you know, it's it's yes
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:52.840]   It's a risk computer that happens to have a watch app but who looks at time anymore my implant wow
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:58.600]   That who looks at time anymore you're frightening me Renee you're with your with your bleak vision of a timeless future
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.480]   How would it even be the future if there's no time anymore?
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:06.360]   I don't know. I think the the difference here is that they called it a watch. I don't I don't feel like a fitness
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.600]   Phone I don't you call the iPhone a phone
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:14.040]   Well, maybe maybe bands and fitness bands are the right way to go then because then then there's no implied timekeeping
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.440]   Where's the band I should play music then? I mean like this whole
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:22.680]   Branding things. I thought it was I thought it was an automatic garage door opener at the at the release event interesting
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:28.760]   Interesting idea. Well, okay. I hear something in the distance speaking of not recognizing what time is or what space is
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:34.680]   What would it what would it be like if leela port who's not even here suddenly appeared to tell us about one of our fine sponsors?
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.480]   Well, I think it would look a little bit like this
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.920]   More Mac break weekly coming up in just a little bit. Thank you for filling in for me
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.320]   By the way as I am on vacation, but I couldn't leave without telling you about square space
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:55.480]   They've had such a great supporter of twit since practically the beginning. I mean practically went square space when dang got out of college
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:00.360]   and Anthony got out of college and they started square space and
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.840]   And they created you know Anthony created it because he wanted a blogging platform
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.320]   But he's also a brilliant like brilliant programmer and he thought I'm gonna do
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.640]   And I've talked to him a lot about this. I'm just really impressed with what he's done
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:20.360]   The server and the software the content management system kind of linked so that way you get some real benefits
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.520]   um
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.120]   for instance
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:30.120]   Whenever you have a square space site as traffic if traffic starts to mount or mount suddenly because you know somebody mentions you
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.600]   on a radio show or something
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.400]   Um
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:40.200]   Squarespace has the ability because they're so tightly integrated to ramp up very quickly to load balance and it's all handled without any
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.160]   You know effort on your part security updates too
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.760]   You know because they manage the software they're making sure it's always secure
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:52.280]   It's it's really the best stuff out there. I'm really happy to use it for my blog. It's leo loport.com
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:59.320]   Uh lisa wanted it when we created the uh our ad agency artisanal lisa wanted to have a website
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:05.160]   She didn't want to spend time designing and and and kind of remembers the pain that we went through a twit
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.640]   Designing creating around website and the cost
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.640]   The nice thing about squarespace they have lots of really good
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:18.360]   Independent developers who work on the squarespace platform. We found one that was very affordable is maintaining your site
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:24.120]   Made a beautiful site at artisanal agency.com. You can check it out and you know what? I don't mind giving out those URLs
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.480]   Even though there's tens of thousands of you might hit it all at once
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.160]   Squarespace never goes down. It's the best hosting plus the best
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.720]   Software sites look great
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:40.120]   Both, you know, it's both design and engineering in every template has the top of the line the best design out there and the best engineering
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.600]   And you don't have to do any coding
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:49.960]   You know if you it's really kind of you could just frankly take a template put content in and stop
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.080]   And it's going to look great, but there are lots of customizable settings so you could tweak it
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.520]   They offer you hundreds of fonts hundreds of fonts
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.400]   um colors page configurations
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.000]   And what's nice is your content separate from the template
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.440]   So if you get tired one day or and you should do this every every year or so for fresh your website
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.880]   It's just a click of a mouse. It's easy. Now if you want to get really geeky
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.200]   They have a squarespace developer platform, which gives you total control
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.760]   But you start with the great engineering as a base
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.960]   You could they have actually a blank template you can use that gives you the mobile responsive design and the e-commerce and all the hooks
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.560]   You need and then you get full control over html css javascript. You get a jcid api
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.360]   So that you actually have your cms as an api adjacent api
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.400]   You could start with a beautiful template or you can use the basic template
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:48.040]   Once your register is developer and you turn on the developer toggle you can use sftp you can use git
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.400]   They have yes, they support git, which is right
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.800]   And just start coding that means you can put something up in development
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.600]   Test it move it to production
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.640]   I mean, it's all the stuff that a developer wants
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.480]   Every every site has mobile built-in mobile responsive
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.920]   You get a free custom domain name with an annual purchase

[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:52.760]   Thank you leo important words from the past i like that he doesn't pretend that he's like in another room here
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.760]   He's on vacation right now
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:01.880]   I mean, so the planetary is just amazing conundrum. He's unleashing it's it's uh there could be a vast rip in the space time continuum
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.760]   If you were to walk i think i think i think it's everywhere
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:10.360]   I think an act four will find out that he actually like has been in stasis for 41 years
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.880]   And we've been using these promos to basically to usurp his power while keeping him helpless interesting
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.440]   Well, there is one more uh sponsor in this episode
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.280]   So people need to stay tuned for that because that might be the big twist big reveal
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   If his hair party in the same side every head
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.360]   That's right. That's right leo will be back soon. He'll be back. I believe for next week's mac
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.000]   Mac work weekly. I think he'll even be back this weekend. So he's coming back. He's coming back. Just wait
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.440]   He's he'll be rptan and rested and ready after three weeks in europe
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:42.200]   But what's the over under on the amount of weight he's gained? I'm guessing no no less than three pounds
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.000]   Well, I mean, he's all the wine is he's doing good on his diet, but that's that's all
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.200]   All all bets are off if you're going for her entire
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.440]   Enjoy yourself. I mean for Pete's sake. Go for Pete's sake. You're in europe
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:01.400]   Every mouthful of kale when you get home will taste that much better knowing that I paid for this kale by having every cannoli
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   I wanted when I was an Italy
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:09.000]   France is gonna hurt him, but it's even odd what happens in russia because he could just come back going every day borscht borscht borscht
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.080]   And then it'll be all different. Oh, I had borscht in russia. It wasn't that bad. Um
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.280]   We're roughly a new sponsor this week the beat huts
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.560]   400 beat hut locations in most major cities that's suspicious
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.120]   Eat a bush beat you hmm
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:31.000]   So a guy writing for a website uh this random website called six colors dot com
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.360]   Uh, oh, that's that's me. That's my website. I wrote this for about to say that i'm interested
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.320]   What you guys think about it, which is I love messages
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.520]   I love what apple's doing with messages on ios 10 the idea that they dumped in all of these new features to make it more fun
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.440]   uh chat programs are incredibly popular on mobile. It's like the killer app of mobile and uh
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:56.680]   My message was kind of boring and they they know that people like to have fun in their message conversations
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.800]   So they added all these features in ios 10 some of them got added to the mac although not very many
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:08.920]   The the issue I have is that it does feel very much like a bunch of features got backed up in a truck and dumped into the app
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   And they're kind of all over the place the the blue arrow is a little less clear about whether you're sending and do you know that you can
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.760]   Force touch or wait, isn't that the shift key? They finally fixed the shift key, right?
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.320]   That's what that blue arrow is the the the 3d touch
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:26.120]   And if you don't have 3d touch you can you can long press on that arrow and then you get some effects
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.240]   But they're also
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   effects on a on a gray
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.120]   There's this gray carrot icon that you can tap and you get three other icons there
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.640]   And if you turn your phone sideways, you can write with ink and there's just there's stuff and there's apps deep down in there
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.520]   But you have to tap like four or five times to get to the messages app store
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.560]   I just that's my Scott forest all is never opening
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   Why why why the call for help the sometimes that I feel when I'm using this
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.480]   So I'm curious what you guys think about messages in general and if you if you
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.840]   Agree or disagree with me that that even even though the features are kind of fun and cool
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.000]   There are a lot of them and they're all kind of in a in a jumble. What do you think?
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.560]   I'll just say that I really really wish it were a multi platform
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:17.560]   That's a complaint I have it's I don't fully understand why Apple's putting why a company is going to be putting that much effort into
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.280]   Basically creating a copy of
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.920]   bringing some of the WhatsApp and some of the
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.840]   Some of the snapchat features into their stock app knowing that one of the reasons why we have
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.000]   Snapchat and WhatsApp is that not all of our friends have the same phone
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.440]   So it's really difficult. I hate the fact that I've got on my own phone
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:43.240]   I've got four or five different chat apps only because I don't need I can't convince everybody to use the same
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.560]   the same standard
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.560]   As and I'm glad to see
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.520]   An app in which apple is along themselves to to have some whimsy and to have a bit of fun
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.600]   But once again, it's like are you doing it better than anybody else can so
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:04.680]   I mean my big problem with messages has always been will I get the message? That's really all I care about and it's like telling time on a smartwatch
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:11.400]   It's kind of a feature. Exactly. I mean that was my first big letdown with apple watch was when I had a I was having breakfast
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.680]   Breakfast with somebody and there was that kind of detour where they turn off that one road
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.800]   You need to get that if you're gonna get someplace in an orderly fashion and no joke
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.240]   It was like a five mile drive
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:29.080]   But because of this one thing being turned off it turned into a 30 mile ride and so well no problem
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   I have my apple watch so during the traffic jam. I simply said blah blah blah
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.840]   Hi, I'm going I'm stuck in traffic. I've got a detour. I'll be 20 minutes late. There you go. Thank you apple watch
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.120]   This is definitely going into the review as a reason why apple watch is so great
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.760]   And then I got there and my my friend was miff because why I'm sorry you should have texted me
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.640]   I said but I used my apple watch to message you and he had an apple watch and an iPhone
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.400]   But messages decided see the last time that he logged in was from his computer in his office
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.360]   I'll direct this message to the computer in his office
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.320]   So yeah, that's that's really all I care about if you make me if you make me a great sms app that has
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.760]   Chat built in that will make sure that no matter what happens it gets the message
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.120]   I'll use it and then I'll use what's app alongside it for the sticker stuff
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:18.280]   But that's where the fail is for me. I just don't trust it enough to even on my even on my my ipads even on my
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.360]   iOS devices. I just don't trust it enough to use it
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.680]   Yeah, I think there's like three separate issues here and one is there's absolutely
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.160]   I think reliability and dependability have gotten way way better
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:32.760]   And I use hangouts and I use skype and I use everything that Andy mentioned because I have friends on all those platforms
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:38.360]   And I wouldn't say any of them are more or less reliable now than iMessage while of them will occasionally drop a message
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.360]   So I think that part is largely fixed
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.720]   Messaging in general is fragmented people in different areas like iMessage is popular in North America
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.520]   But almost unheard of you know what's app is hugely popular in some places line is popular wecha
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.800]   There are fragmentation issues that are going to stop anyone from having a unified messaging system
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.840]   If you have friends in multiple areas or on multiple platforms
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:05.880]   And the other the other two are interesting one is there is cache and having an exclusive messaging service is what helped blackberry in the early days
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:11.480]   If you were on bbm you were a mover and shaker and people aspire to be on bbm and executives were on pin
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.760]   Which was even more prestigious than bbm, but at a certain point
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.640]   You lose the market what's app eats your lunch and the entire value of your company is infinitesimal
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:25.160]   Compared to the company that basically cloned your entire messaging strategy and made it multi-platform. So it's an incredibly
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.720]   Sharp balancing act that you have to pay a lot of attention to and make the smart choice
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.160]   We're yes, it helps you retain users now tomorrow you're hemorrhaging money
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.840]   So you you got to pay super attention. The third thing is I think messages
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.920]   Was a marquee feature for iOS 10 and for various reasons
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:47.480]   It was hard to get to market and they had to do a lot of things like they just they weren't able to get it fully deployed on the mac
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:53.800]   They they were some features that were cut from the iOS version and others that baby didn't get as far along as as they should have
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.760]   And when you look at it, I think that sort of makes sense
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.920]   You like the management when you start having multiple sticker packs and multiple apps
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.720]   It just it did not get the the thinking through it needed and the way that messages are bound
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.120]   I can't delightful that you can collaborate. You can oh stickerate someone completely you can just
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.920]   Slope splat on somebody
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.080]   Totally hide them out. It's an amazing feeling
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:20.680]   But I keep going emoji to get stickers because they're all just pictures to me and the organization and all of that
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:26.760]   I think apple needs another year to sort of figure out the coherence behind the features that they threw on the wall this year
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.280]   Yeah, I think that's exactly that they obviously they've they focused on deploying these features and they did it is as a mac user
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.480]   I'm sad that the mac has some but not a lot of those features the the
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.240]   I still don't entirely understand like there are two different ways to
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.920]   Draw things with your finger. You can do the digital touch is cramped in there
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.720]   You can do digital touch digital touch has it's so confusing that it's got an animated sort of guide
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:55.160]   And then if you tap on that it brings up a screen that explains to you how to use digital touch
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.640]   It's like buried it on the watch the same time. They bought a title
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:03.800]   Well that that and that's that's the really baffling thing is it's like apple watch team is being told look digital touch
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.560]   Deemphasize deemphasize and then the message is team is like we got digital touch now. I think it's hard
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.280]   It is yeah, it's a it's a tough one and I do wonder we were speculating on a podcast
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:19.960]   I do uh upgrade that uh somebody at apple really loves digital touch because that is the only explanation for why
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.720]   It keeps on what happened floated up there
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:27.240]   My understanding is that digital touch they thought it was going to be a big deal and that was shown in the prominence that it was given on the apple watch
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.920]   It was given a prime slot and one of only two dedicated hardware buttons
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.440]   And they were all in on on this and it just did not work out so
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.080]   Cooler heads prevailed and it was moved down
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:42.360]   But at the same time because these development cycles are so long digital touch was being built for iphone and ipad
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:47.000]   And you know they could have canceled it I guess but you know they didn't cancel a totally an apple watch
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:53.880]   So it's like yeah sure cram it in there into it was already a really really really tough process getting the messages finished
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.040]   In time for wdbc
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.200]   Apparently was a lot of ups and downs involved there as well
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.240]   And at the end they just you know, they they had what they could ship
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.400]   And I think if they if they could do it over again
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.840]   They they might have done it a different way and I think they will take the next year sort of one of those like like an iCloud moment
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.320]   Yeah, we'll refine it a little refinements will have it
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.880]   I think to Andy's point about competing with some of these other categories
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.960]   I don't know if this is a it's a base platform feature. It's on every iphone
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:24.680]   I feel like this is more about bringing it's recognizing that people have fun on other platforms with messaging and that they nobody has any fun on
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:31.640]   On iMessage and that maybe apple should give them some things that are like what other platforms have so they maybe they could have fun too
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.400]   Even though they're never going to download a second messaging app because there are a lot of people
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.040]   I would say a huge number of people especially in North America who are not going to download
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.080]   Another messaging app. They're just going to use the one that's on their phone
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:49.640]   So why not make that more fun because clearly people on other platforms are having more fun than they are on iMessage and it does that
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   It's just kind of a hodgepodge right now
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:13:00.120]   Well, also both apple and google are in the same boat where they realize that people they they look at what apps are what apps do people spend most of their time using
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.400]   And more and more it's going to be the messages. Yeah, so if they want to deliver
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:09.080]   Really great features into the rest of the experience they have to project it into a messaging app
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   And so both we were seeing
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:18.120]   Active assistance in in both apples messaging app and in google's messaging app up of today's a google event
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:25.160]   They really made it they part of the keynote of the keynote as it were where that if the transition was from
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.360]   Decent centralized computing to personal computing to mobile computing to phones
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.680]   Now to to mobile now the next step is ai
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.920]   And so really if you want to it's sort of like a letting another letting a third party
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.960]   Have the messaging app is a lot like having letting a third party have your apis and have your
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.440]   Have your your your desktop launcher
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:56.680]   You really need to have the ability to make people think that the concierge to the entire phone experience is going to be your messaging app
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.280]   So it's really important that they get that ground back and they know that they're not going to get it back if it's still
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.240]   If it's still the app you use to tell your mom that
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:14.120]   Everything's fine college is great. I'll chat with you again next friday and you make it more like the one. Okay. I already come
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120]   My mom now we can get drunk
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.120]   Well, I think that's a key point though. I mean
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.520]   Some of these new features really are cute. Some of them are like your parents trying to do snapchat and I don't think they'll name particularly well
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:31.080]   But the important thing is that the absolutely messaging apps are becoming platforms are becoming a layer on top of the base operating system
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:39.080]   And when you look at what line and we chat specifically have done and what some like facebook and google are moving towards because we're actually behind the large asian messaging services
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:46.680]   They're huge platforms already with stickers. Yes, but huge businesses built into gaming and stickers and entertainment and apps and all these things
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:52.040]   And I think the bigger news like the stickers are fun. I love them and the effects are cute, you know, sometimes but it's
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.520]   Messaging apps. I think is what's going to be the huge growth for apple there. Yeah, I think you're right
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.680]   Oh, by the way, while Andy was talking earlier Renee sent me messages with lasers. So thanks Renee
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.520]   I sent you back some balloons with lasers. I got them. I got them. That's good. It's so much fun
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:09.960]   Hey, do you hear the sound that beeping sound that's happening in the background that I imagined and isn't actually there?
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.800]   That's the sound of trucks backing up construction trucks because apple
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.040]   Is building?
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   I I have a whole bunch of stories here and I just want to I thought this was an interesting
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:26.440]   confluence of stories apple the verge reports apple is building a 45 million dollar research center center in beige
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.000]   To develop new hardware
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   apple is building a uk center at the batter see power station the historic
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.280]   Decommissioned batter see power station that's on the tems. They're moving their uk headquarters to batter see
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.400]   Uh and taking up a large percentage of the building not all of it
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.200]   But a large percentage of moving all of their london work to batter see which is pretty cool
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:53.960]   The Danish data center that apple is using is the largest foreign investment in that country's history something very data
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.160]   intensive is happening in the state of deadmark and
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:04.120]   Let's see what else the region street apple store in london is making its long-awaited reopening on october 15th more london news
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.920]   And even more exciting perhaps the lights are on at campus too
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.840]   Now the apple spaceship is glowing to life
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.320]   And now that we are getting just a few months away from the opening of the new apple campus yet campus yes
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.720]   It just it doesn't just look like a spaceship. It glows like a spaceship
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.960]   So I don't I don't know what you guys think about this other than some of this is just apple is a big company
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:37.560]   And they got a lot going on and some of it is apple may be being more open to the fact that they've got a lot of people around the world
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.760]   Working at apple where in the early days of steve jobs the whole watchword was everything happens in kupertino
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.840]   That's really not it doesn't seem to be the case anymore
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.600]   Not for a while. I mean they famously had like voice offices in boston and they
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   I work for ipad was done in vancouver and you know they they have a bunch of offices all around
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.760]   office
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.640]   I know big auto office doing some special project stuff too
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:06.200]   So they're in canada and obviously london so but you know as I mean you mentioned james tomsen earlier our friend james tomsen
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.800]   That was a famous story where he was recalled to the mothership and refused to go in the end because
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:17.640]   They wanted everybody working on ost end to be in kupertino and apple apple has is too big to do that
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:22.120]   It's too much telling me the engineer working on the finder is in bleeping ireland
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:28.280]   Actual steve jobs quote he pulled it off. I like there's a movie to be made
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:32.040]   It's almost like a weekend at bernies except it involves an irish software engineer
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.280]   Scottish software engineer in ireland
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.280]   Uh pretending to be in kupertino when he's actually not that would be a pretty zany
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.200]   Maybe there's an episode of like a houlton catch fire that could do something
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.720]   That'd be great. Houlton caught fire. Yeah, exactly
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.720]   I don't know big apple's a big company and sometimes I think those of us who've been covering it for a long time forget
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.520]   Just what its global reach is and the size of uh of its operations all over the world
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:00.280]   But and china is usually important like we we love to talk about amazon in nor in in especially in america because it's a huge story there
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:07.240]   But am amazon for example in china is almost non-existent because they already have big retailers and big online presences and and their own companies and
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.400]   To compete there is really hard
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.160]   We've seen the trouble that google's head and apple hasn't had the easiest time lately either
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:19.160]   And you can you can paint a picture where the more business apple does like when they invest in chinese companies and they built plants there
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.240]   That's them also invent investing in their future being allowed to sell into that market
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.880]   I know my friends in london are very excited about the regent street store opening up
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:35.080]   It's going to be similar. I think to the uh the store that they opened reopened at union square in san francisco where it's got the sort of new
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.360]   I guess it's the angela arrens era apple store
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:46.200]   Look, but it's opening on october 15th and that is the go-to flagship uh london store and it's finally going to get it's it's reopening
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.000]   Because our our mutual friend mike hurlley is uh
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.600]   Frustrated that regent street hasn't been open you got to go to regent street. So it's it's opening the new
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:01.240]   It was the first apple store in europe. So it's a it's a significant thing. I think we both been to necessarily
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.800]   I haven't I have not no just you and i was you and my carlley
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:14.600]   I was actually the first person to like speak on the stage in the theater at the regent street
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.080]   I was I had just happened me in town like during the opening and so I just
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.880]   They they booked the gig for some reason because I had a book to sell
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.360]   And yeah, I mean it's I guess it does show you the difference between uh apple's
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:32.600]   Relationship with those stores when they first started opening them uh to today where they've it's uh
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.480]   It's uh it's no longer necessarily a theater space
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.240]   It really is a place for people to wait while they have their genius bar appointments
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:44.120]   So that's and also they think they also realize that this is a place where once or twice a year
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.520]   There's going to be a big line of people once or twice a year
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:51.800]   They're going to be like local press are going to have their cameras there to do the hey and who what's your name?
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.360]   And how long have you been waiting in line for the new i-vote 8?
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.520]   So you want the half pint iphone or the full pint iphone comes in pints?
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:05.080]   Yeah, you're gonna have the metric phones over there. That's one of the confusion confusing things about the rest of the world to us americans is the metric phone
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:10.120]   So you had in canada you got the metric phones too liberia is on your side. Yeah, that's right. Thank goodness for that
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.040]   So, um
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.120]   The metric phone is that you double it in at 30. So it's the iphone 44
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:22.120]   Yeah, well, I like to lay a thousand iphones end to end to get a kilo iphone
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.840]   That's what I prefer
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:32.440]   Personally so earlier today as we record this google didn't event we're in which we're not talking about because this is not a google show
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.840]   There are wonderful
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.080]   Android related podcasts available including from twit that you should check out
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:43.400]   And he also hosts cohosts one on relay fm that you could check out
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.680]   But so I didn't even want to bring it up, but I want to bring it up for one reason which is as a news angle
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.640]   Google announced the impending they already mentioned it, but they announced the impending arrival of google home
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:59.080]   which is their equivalent of uh of the amazon echo it is a voice controlled
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:04.600]   Canister that sits somewhere a flower pot basically it sits in your house and it gives
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:11.240]   uh, it gives voice control and uh and a speaker to kind of the air in your living room
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.760]   Which is a pretty cool idea. I love my amazon echo for the same reason
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:21.480]   It's very different from having a phone or a tablet that I can activate or my watch and activate and trigger siri
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:26.200]   Because it is in the house. It's available to everyone everyone can hear it everyone can talk to it
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.600]   And then it can put out music
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.080]   And so I mentioned the google home because there is a question here which is i've written about it a couple of times
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:38.360]   Which is where's apple and uh this week my colleague dan moron wrote on mac world about
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.600]   How next year apple should make what he and i have been calling the siri speaker
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.840]   And i've been wondering about that too is like apple's pushing siri forward on a bunch of fronts
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:52.040]   But I feel like one of the things that apple needs to do is get siri out of our phones
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:57.640]   And watches and into the air of our houses so that we can all talk to it and listen to it
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:03.400]   What do you guys think about the idea of making an amazon echo or google home like thing powered by siri?
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:10.120]   They have i mean they have prototypes that are both include uh an apple tv a stand alone speaker thing a
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.080]   I think something that looks like an airport extreme, but you know more modern
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:19.080]   Uh, one of the big questions with apple is is they don't they don't always do things just because they can and they absolutely have a technology
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.520]   To push these things out, but they have this huge philosophical question that i think they're trying to answer and that is siri right now
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.480]   Is a personal assistant and how do you make it a multi personal assistant?
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   And what i mean by that is if you look at the implementation of siri on the apple tv for example
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:39.160]   It is far smaller than it is on the iphone because with the iphone you can say you know read my text messages read my email
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.440]   What's my calendar? What's my appointment and apple believes that that's usually private information that should be accessible only to the person who owns that information
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.160]   And when you move that to an environment where you could have other family members you could have roommates
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:55.400]   You could be in a dorm you could be in you know sort of a roommate's ability the worst yet
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.360]   No, but i mean, sir like if i say read my text messages and i get any text messages, that's a problem
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.440]   I mean like it's a problem for both of us sometimes
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:08.680]   Uh, and they have to figure out a way of making siri a multi personal and you see those are a lot of things like siri is limited
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.280]   Still for doorknobs and garage doors because you have to authenticate
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   To in order to open those because they don't want you to drop your apple tv remote and somebody open your door and let people inside without your
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.880]   Permission and that might seem silly, but they really do have this sort of security and privacy first angle
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.760]   If they didn't care about that, I think we would have that product on the market
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.320]   But I think and I think it's the same reason why like you don't see air pods immediately on the apple tv
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.720]   They're not sure what their multi person
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.920]   um
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.040]   Multi person philosophy is yet and once they nail that once
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.000]   Sireically the detect voices or this or you know you
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.720]   Detect your apple watch or it does something
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.160]   Then they'll figure out well we'll make one that doesn't suck simply because it'll have access to all your information
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.760]   But it'll know it's you before you give it before it gives it to you and do what do you think?
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.160]   um
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.360]   Yeah, that's a very that would be a very apple way to do it that we don't want we've got our priorities
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:04.760]   And we're not going to ship something until we figured out how to make this work towards the way that we think
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.200]   Such a device to do but that's also one of I think apples
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.000]   biggest failings because
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.520]   uh
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.120]   The amazon echo
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:19.320]   Didn't address those problems, but it's wonderful. It works great. I bought us
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.680]   I
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:26.200]   I have the one that was sent as a press review unit and then I want to buying some because okay
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.840]   I can't use this anymore because it's it's it's a review unit and I just love it so much
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.440]   And all these other features that they're not perfect and they didn't solve every problem
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.480]   But at least they got it out there and I don't think the world really knew
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:45.880]   That there was this gap in the the standard technology load out of every house until amazon did something kind of crazy
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:50.520]   And put these things in and now google has seen how well those devices have done
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:58.520]   They have quickly realized that well we have that we know more about our customers than anybody else who interacts with uh with our customers
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.800]   We could do something that's very much like this and it would be even better
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:09.400]   Given that uh, they're trying to make the google assistant into as important a product for google as the iphone is to apple
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.560]   And that too is not going to have
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.720]   A flawless execution, but it's a hundred twenty nine dollar device
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.760]   You can buy today as opposed to a device that we all agree it makes sense for apple to make
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.080]   But apple doesn't comment on unannounced products
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.440]   I think that is apple does sometimes release a product when they don't know what it should be yet
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:34.920]   Namely the apple watch, but I really think that they should have more low stakes things like this
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.760]   It's it's again. It's such a cool thing that the number of times i've sold
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.000]   Uh
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.320]   An amazon I keep I keep wanting to call it my alexa when it is the amazon echo
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.240]   That's how important it is
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.080]   But the number of times that people i've just
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.920]   I've someone is i'm leaving for to go out to go out to dinner or something with somebody
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.760]   And we're meeting up at my house and i'm just you know as a as a casual thing i'm saying hey
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.240]   Alexandria, uh, what's the weather right now and without even looking because i'm working for either the light jacket or the heavy jack
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.240]   Is it what did it just do? Oh, it's just the thing
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.000]   Is just a lexa how does it work? Is it okay? Well, okay?
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.080]   Then i'm afraid of what's gonna happen when i turn off the lights in the house
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.920]   By saying okay, i'm leaving now and god dang it
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.120]   We're gonna miss the from the movie because i'm gonna do another 20 minute demo of this thing
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.200]   So it's it's clearly something that works great
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:31.800]   Why doesn't apple make one if i hope it's not because i hope it's because they feel as though they've got they're plateful already
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.400]   And they don't want to take on more than they can effectively communicate and support and market
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:41.080]   I hope it's not because we are not going to make this until we've decided it's the best one of these it's ever been made
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.440]   I think rene makes a really good point about the fact that apple so much of what apple does is with serious personalized
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.760]   I think another issue is that siri resides on devices with screens
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.720]   And if you've ever used siri you've realized that a lot of times in in most modes of siri
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:02.200]   It's going to frequently kick you to things that are on the screen and say i looked this i looked this thing up for you
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.400]   Here it is and on something like the amazon echo you can't do that you can't
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.160]   punt and send it to the screen
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.440]   And so it's a different siri experience that they would need at the same time with the existence of apple music
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.720]   And itunes match the fact that you've got so much of a music infrastructure that apple already has
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.000]   And uh and the fact that siri already does exist even if you were to take off some of the personalization of it
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.040]   I feel like that would be a great product just as an apple music product plus some other stuff thrown in
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.240]   It's certainly not an easy product to build and I don't think anybody's saying that
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:40.360]   But I think it's intriguing to imagine what an apple product would be that was like an amazon echo or like a google home
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.560]   But with a little bit of a an apple spin on it and I hope they play because I love that feature like like Andy was saying
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.760]   You know, I love that amazon echo. It is a fun product
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.000]   It is it is just is it the best speaker in my house?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.360]   Not even close is it the best personal voice assistant in my house?
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.640]   Probably not but the fact that it's always there and everybody in my family can use it
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.400]   That's compelling and I i'm interested in what google will do with a google home
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:09.400]   And i'm very interested in the idea that maybe apple could do its take on that and it would be better integrated with the rest of my life
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.800]   That I keep in in apple stuff because I am an apple music subscriber
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:20.440]   I would like to say hey lady play this song and I can't do that with Alexa because the amazon music library
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:25.080]   Doesn't have the stuff that's in apple music for me to get a cheap plug in the
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:30.280]   Next and maybe final episode of debug. It has leon appalitana on it and she was
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:37.400]   Experienced lead for syria on carplay and on apple tv and she explains just that like how when you have a screen in front of you
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.920]   What sort of visual affordances you have and when you don't have a screen like on carplay
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.080]   You can't stare at it for a long time or apple tv the context is so different than a phone
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.080]   So if they know you're looking at a screen they give you much they give you much less information
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:56.360]   Uh out loud than they would if they don't think you're looking at a screen like in a car and then they explain more and it's a whole fascinating area of user experience on its own
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:04.600]   Yeah, and also points out that you're experienced with uh Alexa and music that uh, it's also a missed opportunity because these devices kind of
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.400]   Convinced people to buy more services. I was not a I was not I was
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.000]   Uh
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.240]   What got me to finally spend 20 or 25 bucks a year to get like unlimited music storage on uh on my amazon account
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.040]   Was knowing that I could just be doing the dishes and then just simply call out and ask Alexa
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:26.600]   Play play some beetles for me too. And that's what got that's what got me to say. Okay. You know what?
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:33.160]   It's worth uh two nights of uploading and 25 bucks a year to keep my entire music library sync to this thing
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.400]   So that's another bit of opportunity that the apple might be missing out on the longer they wait
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:43.000]   Yeah, I agree. Well, we we uh have a little more show left to go. We're gonna do our picks
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.600]   It's been a big show lots of stuff going on, but before we do that
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:52.120]   It's time for the big plot twist maybe which is this other message in a bottle cast to us
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.600]   And it just washed up on the shore from leo l'apport leo
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:59.800]   More macaré weekly coming up in just a bit, but I want to tell you I'm missing my cat. I can tell right now
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.080]   I'm on vacation. I know i'm going on a very nice boat and everything
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.840]   But i'm gonna be missing my cast for mattress. I love my cast for mattress
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:12.520]   Casper is reinventing the mattress business. They they are an online
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:18.120]   Retailer, but they make the mattresses so there's no markup. There's no middleman

[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.840]   And I know wait you're saying but how do I know if I like it?
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.280]   Well, this is and i've mentioned this before I know you know the beauty part is

[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.680]   You have a hundred nights if at any time in the hundred nights you say well, that was nice

[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:12.600]   Lisa and I you know she likes a cushy mattress. I like a firm mattress

[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.040]   They are just great

[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.160]   Casper mattresses by the way
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:53.320]   They uphold the highest environmental production standards. They're made in the USA
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:58.600]   They come in a very surprisingly compact box which makes it easy to move in

[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.960]   That's your plot twist it was Casper all along
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.760]   It's a it's a cue we're supposed to
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.280]   Be awake now awake and everybody awake and she cries against the machine
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:51.080]   All right, it's time for the picks of the week. I will go first as your sub host. I will go first
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:56.040]   I looked I can I'm convinced that I've talked about this app before but I'm going to talk about it again because it's great
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:02.200]   Especially if you use a Mac and you tether to a cellular device a lot which a lot of people do
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:07.400]   It's called trip mode it costs eight bucks. You can get it at trip mode.c h and what does it do?
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.080]   It lets you decide what apps and processes on your Mac
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:20.280]   Use data and which ones do not see unfortunately unlike your iPhone where there the apps can actually behave differently when they're on a cell network and a Wi-Fi network
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.480]   Your Mac just thinks it's on a Wi-Fi network all the time or ethernet, right?
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.840]   It doesn't know that you're tethered to a cell network
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.440]   Well, sometimes it does but it doesn't care. I guess is what I'm saying it doesn't care
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.680]   And so it will kill
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:37.160]   Your cell connection and use all your bandwidth doing an online backup
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:40.680]   Let's say because it doesn't understand that it really ought not to be using data
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:45.720]   So with trip mode you turn it on you choose the apps that you want to have access to the network
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:49.800]   And uncheck the apps that you don't it'll also warn you if an app tries to use
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.240]   Data so that you can go in there and choose whether to let it have data or not
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.080]   I use it actually all the time for podcasting because when I'm podcasting
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:01.160]   I want to use as little network as possible so that my audio and video can get through
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.360]   But I still want access to the internet, but it is perfect if you're somewhere where you have a very limited amount
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.480]   It's good for hotels too
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:12.360]   Not just tethering but hotels where you've got like a very small amount of bandwidth that you can really get out the door
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.760]   And you don't want that online backup firing you don't want that iCloud drive sync happening
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.800]   You don't want Dropbox triggering when you're trying to do something else so trip mode eight bucks
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:27.080]   It's cross-platform. You can actually buy for a little bit more get it for Mac and windows and I love it a lot
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.560]   So if you are a person in one of those circumstances
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.280]   It is great to let you manage your own data
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.480]   I wish apple would add some of this to macos in the future some intelligence about
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:45.000]   When you're on a certain kind of network, but alas, I think it is not to be so in the meantime we will use trip mode
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   Andy, what's your pick?
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.560]   My pick is a book. I've been I pre-ordered a long time ago and finally came this week
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.800]   It is w
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:59.800]   Let's say classroom in a box from adobe is the lightroom cc and photoshop cc for photographers and written by
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:05.320]   Really great trainer lisa snider. She has she's a friend of mine have known her for a long long time
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.240]   But this is I was so excited about this book that I didn't even do the
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.520]   Lisa
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.520]   Maybe I'd like to review this sometime
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.120]   So could you put me on the comp list? No, I just went right on amazon and pre-ordered it
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.640]   And i'll tell you why because I've been I've been I'm a
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.040]   Photography fan i'm an amateur
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.680]   So I'm no stranger to lightroom and photoshop cc
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:31.400]   But the problem is that I'm sort of in the same boat as a rank beginner because I have never took taken classes
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:38.600]   So every technique that I use is something I figured out for myself as opposed to the right way or the better way of doing things
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:44.280]   And every time that uh every time that I look through the menus of photoshop and lightroom
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.680]   I will find a feature that oh
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:50.920]   So I could have done that in eight minutes instead of spending two days editing it
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.600]   Using my 1998 photoshop skills
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.040]   And it's a beautiful book like I said she at lisa is an educator
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.120]   She just teaches classes teaches classes teaches classes and she's been writing books pretty much forever
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.840]   So she knows how to teach stuff to people who don't necessarily know know what they're doing
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.000]   And it's beautifully illustrated every page is in color and it really will take you step by step by step
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.160]   Not in like academic sort of language saying a Gaussian blur uses the following algorithm
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.640]   It's here is a picture. I think we want to fix it by doing this we can do that easily by
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.320]   Using edge detection or we can use it better with a smart fill
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:33.960]   So the as a classroom in a book they're not dirt cheap the the cover price of this is a 5999
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.840]   But it really is a classroom in a book. It means it's not it's not a cheap book
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.320]   That's printed on bad paper with black and white illustrations with that one that is a
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.920]   Swipe strip of real color photos in the middle written by somebody for whom this is the third book
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.200]   They're writing this month on such disparate topics as microwave cooking feng shui
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.040]   And making the most of your xml based base database
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.720]   This is an expert who does nothing but talk about photoshop and it arrives three days ago and already
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.720]   I've been like I was going to edit these three or four pictures I took over the weekend
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   But I want to read this chapter before I do it first so as far as I'm concerned
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.080]   It's already paid for itself. So this is very very high recommendation again
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.600]   I realize that 60 bucks isn't cheap
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.200]   But think of it in terms of going and taking a structured class only you can basically do this
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.440]   You can do this on the plane. You can do this on the train
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.040]   Keep it next to your desk. Keep it wherever you do your photo editing
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.000]   I guarantee you it will just pay for itself in the amount of time
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.360]   It saves you and the amount of pleasure gives you and being able to take the picture that you actually took
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.480]   And make it look like what you had in your head when you took that picture
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.280]   So that's where I got I would love to read the microwave cooking book by lisa snider though
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.280]   So if she wants to bring a job
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.320]   Um, it would involve kick but it would still involve kickboxing. Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure it would and feng shui too. Why not?
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.800]   Renee, what's your pick?
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:38:00.280]   I have two picks, but first breaking apple has released a new ios beta ios 10.1 beta 2 and apparently
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:05.720]   It fixes things like reduced motion for message effects and lets you replay message effects and all sorts of things like that
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.440]   So if you're on the beta track, uh run and go check it out
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.760]   No new portrait mode features, but some some some things I think will make some people happy
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.640]   Um, my two picks the first one Jason mentioned earlier, but I had very little to do with this
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.400]   But I'm delighted with how it turned out
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.720]   So there is an imore show sticker pack so you can find all the hosts of the imore show
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.120]   From mica sergeant to georgia doubt. It's friend. He called well
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.080]   Laurie Gill all of them in sticker form
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:35.160]   We tried to pick some of the catchphrases that we are mocked the most for and because stickers are delightful
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:39.400]   You can now throw a srenity true facts on anything that you want to put it on
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:42.040]   Or like an animal or you know
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.720]   Sort of anything that you find delightful at the moment. I really enjoy it and we have been sticker obliterating people with them
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.400]   So uh your mileage may vary check them out though if you haven't it's free
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:54.120]   So you have nothing to lose but your time and maybe your sanity
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.760]   The second pick is a wonderful article mica sergeant the afra mentioned mica sergeant put together
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.080]   On apple lugs now
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.480]   I didn't link to a specific product because it really depends on which watch you have what color it is and what size it has
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.000]   And he went through and put together a list of all the different
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.000]   Lugs and what it is is apple has a lot of bands and third parts have a lot of bands that just ship with uh stainless steel lugs
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.880]   And some people are okay with that other people get really upset because they have a space gray or a space black or a rose gold or a
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.800]   Gold watch and it just doesn't match and they can never unsee that
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.320]   It's like a panda look or something and it it it really bothers them
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:35.560]   So with this you can just go and pick a separate set of lugs ones that match the casing style of the apple watch that you have
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.320]   it comes with
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.360]   Uh the torx screws that you need so you just unscrew the lugs on that your favorite band you screw them into the new
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:50.360]   Um, lug and you pop it onto your watch and you have blissfully coordinated apple watch serenity in your future
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.920]   Uh and he tried it with a bunch of different ones and really like the results and I I'm ordering and spending my entire weekend
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:02.120]   I think fixing all my apple watch bands. So if you're into apple watch if you have a few bands like I do
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:06.520]   You might be super interested in this. That's the understatement of the week right there a few bands
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.520]   I have the leather
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.360]   I have the leather band. It's got the stainless steel lugs and I've got a space gray
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.480]   Watching it doesn't bother me too much, but I have friends who look at it. They're like that's like clown pants there man
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.040]   I think you're an animal. That's right. Exactly right. You can't do that
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.240]   Well, I think we've reached the end. Did I did I do okay? Did I did I ruin the show guys or was it was it okay?
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.800]   It was fantabulous. Okay good
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.560]   Good you were you you landed yet you landed the plane on the water
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.120]   You were and and you were
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:41.320]   A list actor. It wasn't meant to be a water landing or have I landed in the wrong place
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:47.240]   That's terrible the pontoons out. Do we we landed? Okay? Good. All right. Well leo is going to be back next week
