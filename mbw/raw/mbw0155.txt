[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Join me in studio as usual, the great Alex Lindsay from the
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Pixel Core, Pixel Core.tv and Pixel Core.com.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   With that great guild of multi-meter artists.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yes.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I am oogling over the new board.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Oogle, googly.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   We're all digital today.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Wow.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's so awesome.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I was using it yesterday.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I loved it.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's really nice.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   As a former DJ, you'd appreciate this.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   They designed this for DJs.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It has all the little...
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Every time you think, "Oh, it'd be really great if they added this"
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and then, "Oh, it's there.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's there.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's a pretty neat stuff in it."
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Also with this via Skype, Mr. Andy and not Co.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I thought you were going to be like sitting in the park with
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   your MIFI.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I need to.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I did one test out with the MIFI in anticipation of being in
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   New York on Tuesday and not wanting to miss the show.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It turns out that I left that day because I had a little bit
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   of the freelancer's deadline remorse saying, "Oh, I am
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I in central park enjoying myself, but I could be working at
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   home."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Which would be much, much more pleasant being in a beautiful
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   city.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I definitely wanted to start doing some remote segments.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Load up, have a two computer setup.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   One just for Skype, one just for Twitter and just pretending
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   that I know what I know about by using the Wikipedia and other
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   deep insider resources.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   MIFI actually works pretty okay in video streaming video via
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Skype.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I don't think it's quite as wonderful and dynamic as what
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   you would see right now.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I mean, for God's sakes, this is practically cinematic.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I mean, people probably skyping you and saying, "When did you
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   hire Thomas Schumacher to edit your videos?"
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Because it is just, you know, I think when we actually got our
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   own focus puller, that's when things really got good.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yes.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That made the difference.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You still have to subcontract to the clapper though.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You don't have your own guy.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   No, we don't have our own guy.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   If you had one of those really tight crews, you wouldn't have
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   to go out on Craigslist.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You would have to go out on the market.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You would have the guy who always claps your films.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I need a clapper.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's a slight in market.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Does a clapper do anything but clap?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Well, it's usually a camera assistant.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I think it's usually the second camera assistant.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And once again, it's another one of those things that is
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   remarkable.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's very easy to do.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You don't fully appreciate it.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's very easy to do the basic, you know, put it in.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I could do that.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But you've got to write down the right take, the right,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   all that stuff.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah, you've got to keep track of that.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And then you have to make sure, can you do it with one hand?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Can you do it with one hand with everything moving?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It takes a lot of skill and causes a lot of RSI.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So then the shots started.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Couldn't handle it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Christian Bale is emoting.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   What does that person do now?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Well, it's not so much that they're doing something during the
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   shot.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It's not during the shot.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's a down.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know, people ask like, why is there so many names on those
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   credits?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Why are there so many people on the set?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And the thing is, is you realize there's not that many people.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   When the actual shot is moving, there are hopefully not that many
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   people moving because it gets confusing for the actors.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And so there's, you know, four or five people doing something
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   at that time.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But to get a lot of shots done all the time, you know, to get a
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   whole bunch of setups or shots done in a day, you need all those
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   people right around it.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So the moment the shot shot ends, everyone goes back to work.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so they're writing down, you know, they're writing down
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   camera information, lens information.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So there's, oh, there's lots to do.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It's, it's a, it's an intense, intense thing.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And there's guys, there are guys that sometimes are standing around,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   but you need, when you need them, you need them all.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And it doesn't make any sense not to have them.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And we used to, I, I vastly undervalued having lots of people on
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   set until we started doing lots of shoots.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And then I, we've slowly added more and more people.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, I'm getting rid of everybody.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I'm doing my own clap.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   You're using mini slate.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Yeah, do the mini.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   You're outsourcing your clap to Mumbai.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Look, everybody else.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Actually, believe it or not, you are outsourcing your editing to
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Mumbai.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I mean, I'm not sure if you're not, but I, I do need a clapper because,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   we haven't decided yet, but I think we're going to have separate recording of audio and video streams.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So I am going to actually have to begin every show with a clap or something.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Well, you've seen, you've seen the iPhone after that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   There is.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   There's lots on the iPhone.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   There's a, yeah, I mean, there is a, what's the call?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Clap it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I actually have one and I can get a snapper.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Hey, on beep.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I have a fee if I can find it using the power of, of, of.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I have, hold on.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That's bizarre.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   What does it do?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It makes it sound.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.400]   It puts up, it puts up color bars and then when you tap it, it just goes beep.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.840]   It's actually very, very useful if you're using like cheap, if you're trying to fake
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.000]   sink is always a problem.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Here's one.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Right.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Right.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So here it is.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Here's, it's called slate.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And so when you just hold it up, it just goes.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Oh, I would have to get that.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Look at that.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Alex, is that the one you have?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Tap parts.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Who is it?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Oh, that's all that.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So, so that, so that means that like if.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I want it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I want it.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.800]   So it means that if you have like two or three like cheap little, let's say you're trying
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.240]   to fake like a multi-camera setup.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   Right.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.240]   You have one decent camcorder.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.240]   Right.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   But then you realize, wait a minute, I've got the iPhone 3GS.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.720]   I'll just like put that, I'll just like put it on a little tripod in the corner of the
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.000]   room, start that going or I have like a, I have a little flip my now.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'll just start that going.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.520]   All I have to do is start the scene by just holding this up, slating it.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.920]   Not, not that you care about the timecode, but all you care about is that every single
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.440]   one of these recordings has a beep and that little, that little visible flash that has
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   that.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Alex has that.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   I used to do that.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   I used to do that.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   Smart slate.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.000]   And then the, and what was we'd have three cameras all, all I soed.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.240]   They were each had their own recordings.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240]   Right.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.240]   You'd have to sync them up somehow.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   And so we would, we would use a smart slate.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.760]   And then if you, if you have a smart slate, it's showing you timecode.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.240]   And then what you can do is you can literally go into Final Cut and you just look at the
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   timecode and say, modify timecode and you just type in the timecode that you see on any,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.160]   any given frame of any, you don't even have to find the same one.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.360]   And it'll just, they're all, they're all lined up after that.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.240]   So Snow Leopard, it's official.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.600]   The rumor mill was right.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   I'm starting to credit the Apple rumor mill better.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   They're getting better and better.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.720]   They are getting good, aren't they?
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.280]   I'm thinking we're going to get the tablet maybe even.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.640]   I think that's kind of at this point of foregone conclusion.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   I guess so.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   Apple said nothing.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   There's a lot of argument about when it's coming out, but I think everyone is pretty clear
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.960]   that it is coming out.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.720]   Snow Leopard will come out Friday.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.880]   I immediately rushed to the Apple store to my pre-order and Apple's pretty good.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.240]   I already had a pre-order at Amazon, but Apple's pretty good about getting it day and day.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.320]   Amazon said September 1, so I said, okay, I'm going to get it from the Apple store.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.360]   I'm glad that the Apple store is 100 feet from my office.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.240]   You can just walk over and send someone over and pick one up.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   It's about time because I have lost every copy of Leopard we had lying around us.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.920]   I've disappeared.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.200]   I'm going to keep the Amazon order and then I'll have 10 copies of Leopard, two family
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   packs.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   I think that's actually a really good idea.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   For 49 bucks.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   It's actually.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.440]   So for $100 less than one copy of Windows, I've got 10 copies of Leopard and I can put
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   it on everything.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.440]   No Leopard.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.280]   You really want two sets of disks.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.200]   Yeah, well, this is another thing I'm going to do.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.040]   Can you burn a DMG file of the people have sold this?
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   You can.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.000]   We have had trouble in the past where we end up with Arata.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.200]   When we do any Apple spent a lot of money doing.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   Is that copy protection?
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.920]   Well, I know that with the final cut disks, it's copy protection because we wanted to back
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.400]   cars up because we lost them.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.280]   And so when we got new ones, we wanted to back them up and we couldn't.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   And so we.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   That's interesting.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   So we really moved to, you know, we treat the Apple disks in general and maybe it's not
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.200]   as bad with the with the OS, but we treat we treat Apple disks in general kind of like
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.360]   gold.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   We don't try to.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.160]   Last box with a little hammer, it says break only an emergency.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   I wish they would sell them like USB.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   Yeah, I know.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.640]   I really don't need to put all those disks in.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.840]   Just give me a USB stick that I can just seven there and say go because it will it definitely
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   works with Leopard.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   I mean, I always have.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   You can't do.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   Okay.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   Well, you can't write.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   Yeah, my my Drobo.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.760]   I have like DMGs of most of my master does, including again, the third time I was looking
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.480]   for an installed disk, but could not find it and wound up saying, am I really going to
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.880]   buy another copy of Leopard just because I need a clean install and I can't find.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.760]   Now let's talk about this clean install issue because this is the upgrade version.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.240]   You will have to have a copy of Leopard to put snow Leopard on for the $29 version.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.640]   Does that mean I have to have it on the hard drive?
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.440]   Do we know?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   Anybody?
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   I don't know.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.920]   Bueller to me, usually I want to do a clean install.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.280]   For me, a big upgrade like this usually means a truly clean install, which means I start
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.520]   with a blank drive and I just start building everything back up again.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.560]   It's a very painful process that usually takes me about three or four days to finish.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   You feel good about it afterwards.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.440]   But it runs well and I feel like, you know, I don't do it very often.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.960]   I do it every year and a half or so and it's really I find that it just gets rid of all
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   the gunk that I have filled my computer up with by installing lots of little apps that
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.160]   we want to cover for the show.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.400]   He's volunteering in the chat room, by the way, to be a clapper for us.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   Very good.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.960]   It would be a good gig.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.280]   He just sit around all day.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   So Ozzy, no, see, I'm sorry, Ozzy wants it.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   Ozzy wants it.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   I'm sorry, Ozzy.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   I didn't mean to do it.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   There you go.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   We can make this into a bid position.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.480]   I have one's the die.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   I have one bark.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   One bark.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   Do I hear two?
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   Do I hear two?
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.560]   So we don't know then what the requirement will be to upgrade.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.240]   Will you have to have Leopard installed on the disk that you're up?
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.080]   Ozzy.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.720]   I'm guessing that all you'll need is if you already have Leopard on your drive, I'm guessing
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.200]   that it will upgrade.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.000]   But what if I want to do a clean install?
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.720]   Like it's wiped off.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.520]   You can tell it to do a clean install, can't you?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   Oh, I see.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.960]   You can just say you put this all that's going to say I want to clean it.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.280]   So don't wipe it ahead of time.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   It'll just copy it.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.920]   I'm going to wipe it ahead of time.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   And I'm not sure how that's going to work.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.360]   Okay, you be the one and you let me know.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   Okay.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.360]   Get back to me.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   I'll let you know.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   You might be installed Leopard first and then it's not Leopard.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.920]   Good website that they've been telling me about in the chat room, the Snow Leopard compatibility
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   wiki.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.320]   It's at snowleopard.wicky.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.640]   Now that's confusing.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.840]   That really wasn't a good name choice.com.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.600]   So it's snowleopard.wikidot.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Period.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   C-O-M.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.560]   If that makes any sense.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.560]   And here a list.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   Wow, I'm crazy.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.120]   Yeah, this is great.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.760]   This is really great.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.360]   So you can see ahead of time which apps are you're going to have problems with.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.600]   You know, backup bouncer will not work.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.240]   For instance, bento two, a bit flaky, but when restoring from backup.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.920]   I mean, somebody's really put some notes into this.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.000]   So that's I think, you know, something I probably should review.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.040]   There's some things you've got to have.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.160]   And if they don't work, you know, final cut doesn't work.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   I'm going to be in trouble.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.360]   Final Cut Express works.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.440]   I don't see Final Cut Studio.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.760]   Of course, Apple stuff will all work.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.960]   In fact, I think Final Cut Studio may work better.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.280]   They work better.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.520]   I know they're probably more focused on stability and snowleopard than they were in leopard
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   because they're releasing so close to the release of the OS.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.840]   No one in this room or on this call has used the final version of slowleopard.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.960]   If they could, they wouldn't be able to talk about it.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.440]   Would they, Alex?
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.000]   No comment.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.800]   Would they, Andy?
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.640]   Well, I really don't think we're going to see a tablet any time before.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   You're expecting something else to speak.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.400]   That's just the five.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.560]   I think it's going to be great to talk about it when we all get the final disc on Friday.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   I'm the only one who hasn't.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.640]   It's apparently hasn't used it.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.360]   So I'm completely, I have no NDA.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.880]   I completely can talk about it.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   And I know nothing.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.760]   I have read many of the things on the Apple site about the operating system and I've developed
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   a lot of greater pain.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.240]   So actually out of curiosity, they were saying for a long time, this isn't a huge upgrade.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   This is just a polishing.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.600]   But I get the feeling there's more than that, like with OpenCL stuff like that.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.720]   Well, I think that, and I think some of those things, I think some of the things that are
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:41.280]   the most interesting about the new OS, and this is just from the PR that we've seen so
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.400]   far, of course, is a lot of that stuff that's kind of under the hood.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.480]   Like OpenCL will not affect us immediately.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.160]   Because programs have to use it.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.640]   People have to build the programs and get them out.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.400]   But as people start, we're looking at regearing a whole bunch of our software to take full
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.680]   advantage of OpenCL with our compositing software.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.000]   And we think that we'll see massive speed increase.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.680]   Is the SDK out the toolkit?
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.880]   I mean, have you been able to start now or do you have to wait?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.880]   Our guys have been looking at it.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.160]   But we haven't built anything yet.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.200]   We've been working on the second version of Conduit right now.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.520]   And so we're just trying to finish that.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.160]   And then the next version after that.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.480]   And I think we're kind of in the same boat that a lot of developers are in, where it's
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.120]   the version after the one we're finishing that we're going to kind of rebuild everything
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.960]   to take advantage of the OS.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.000]   And so that's the, I think that's what's coming.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.800]   But I think that OpenCL is going to speed things up a lot.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.920]   I think that there is a, you know, I think that one of the things to look at is also
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.160]   services, which has been completely rewritten.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   Which I don't know.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   Does anybody use services?
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   They will now.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   That's his menu.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.440]   Yeah, because nobody, I mean, you know, it was there and it was great.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.320]   Applications was stall stuff and services.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.080]   And if you look at what they've done to services, if you can go, you can see some of this on
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   their website.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.120]   And also if you go to, I think it's Mac OS automation dot US.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.560]   This is the, and if you look at what they've done with services, it is by itself a reason
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.640]   to upgrade to Snow Leopard.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.080]   You're basically able to now build your own services with Automator and then make them
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.400]   contextual.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.280]   So whatever program you're in, if you're in a text editor, it'll do certain things
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.480]   if you're in a, and there, and it's really been extended, cleaned up and they basically
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.520]   took something that was not used by anybody that I know of, except for people like in
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.120]   pre-press and turned it into something that if you're not using it, I mean, it's basically
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:39.240]   like putting, what's that crazy program that you use that's really fast, that pops things
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   in and out.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.200]   You know, quick silver, you know, that program.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.120]   It's like, it's like quick silver built into services.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.720]   But imagine being able to do anything you want to do, you know, operations, uploading
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   things, moving things around.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.080]   If you know, you know, sell any changes to an Automator or Apple script in the new one,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.720]   I think that's the big change.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.040]   So it's tied to that.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.480]   And so, and so we're going to be doing some videos with Sal that we, as soon as we get
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:13.360]   the, as soon as we get the, the final version, like we're hoping to release stuff literally
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.200]   Friday afternoon.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.520]   If everything goes well of stuff we're recording with Sal to talk about services and automation,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.240]   but it's, it is exciting.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.440]   And you can see some of this stuff.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.240]   I mean, some of this stuff is already on Apple site and also on Mac OS.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.280]   And I think this is something that we're talking about here.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.080]   I don't think anybody's, this is like the sleeper, you know, the, the services, the
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.960]   upgraded services and the change into service.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   So that's your prediction that this will be the thing everybody will be talking about.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.000]   I'm going to be talking about it, but it's something they should be talking about if
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.080]   they're not because it is a, it is a, it, it is going to change our workflow.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   Completely, you know, when we're doing production, predictions.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.160]   Andy, you agree?
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.960]   Again, I was like Alex, I was at the big keynote at WWDC and based on the stuff that
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.800]   I saw at that public keynote.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.400]   There, there, I don't think there's going to be that one big slam dunk feature like,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.920]   Oh my God, time machine.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.280]   Now I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm ungodly protected against any form of malfeasance against any
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.800]   one of my individual files.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.600]   Like I simply make it, where I can wish any problem back into the cornfield from which
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   it came and restore any file to where it was to any given point and time since I started
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.840]   up this Macintosh, we're not going to see features like that, but we are going to see
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.840]   cool little individual features that are like, wow, what this should, this is the way
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.960]   it should have worked to begin with or wow.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.720]   Isn't that a cool little tweak or cool little feature to me?
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.360]   The changes they made to the doc again, based on the demos I've seen at WWDC, but before
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.800]   starting the show, I'm in my last couple of weeks of finishing up a book, which means
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.720]   that even with spaces going on, I've just got windows and windows and windows and applications
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.480]   running and it should never be this difficult to simply say, I've got this picture in I
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.160]   photo, I want to drag it into a message.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.560]   I want to drag it into a document window.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.760]   It shouldn't have to be drag, drag, drag, reveal, reveal, reveal, drag the windows around
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:11.520]   if I get, drag around my window so that I've got a non overlapping path from the source
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.160]   to the destination.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.280]   Just the simple fact that it doesn't matter what order your windows are in or how they're
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.360]   stacked up, I can just simply grab that photo, drag it into the doc, drag it on top of the
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.440]   mail app.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.080]   It won't simply, it won't simply drag it into the application.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.560]   It will simply pop up a list of every single active window in that application and I can
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.440]   simply drop it onto whatever window I want and it will simply be pasted and dragged in
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.720]   wherever the insertion point happens to be.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.360]   That's the sort of feature I'm talking about.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:50.720]   For 29 bucks, imagine that you bought about 400 really cool little $10 share where utilities,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.560]   only instead of being some college kids spend a couple of weekends on it or some open source
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.360]   guy, just did it to have something to show off at the next meeting and then sort of dropped
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   it.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.800]   It's been polished, it's all been argued and it's all been made really, really pretty.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.560]   I think that's going to be the point of it.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:13.440]   But I have to say that I have to make room in my brain for two different rooms full of
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   idle speculation.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.480]   One of course will always be the Apple tablet.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:23.160]   The other one now is I wonder if Apple isn't up to something because if you go onto Apple's
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   website, they go...
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.160]   It's always up to something.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   Although, okay.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.800]   I'm going to talk unusually up to something where if you go to the Apple website, they
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.240]   get to choose of course which three big features they really want to show off.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.960]   It's got a list of all these different little tweaks but here are the three things that
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.520]   have their own little logos and their own little special pages and almost all of them
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   are...
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.800]   Of the three, two of them are performance related.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:58.200]   It's about making better use of multi-processing, better use of a better substitution for multi-threading
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.400]   and using the unused bandwidth of a graphics processor.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.480]   Another interesting feature that I'm curious as to why it even exists, they're making a
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.400]   big deal out of the fact that now the operating system is much, much more compact.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.680]   They're promising a footprint that's much smaller than it was before, that they're using
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:22.120]   a variety of techniques including compression to reduce the size of the system folder.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.120]   You know what?
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.080]   For $50, I can get what?
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.280]   80 terabytes on one hard drive?
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.840]   This is not 1992.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.760]   We're saving an extra five gigabytes on a hard drive is a really, really big deal.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.840]   There are two things that I'm wondering.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.320]   Number one, on the idea of having a more compact system folder, does that imply that they're
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   going to be making a really heavy move towards solid-state drives where the big drive is
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.480]   going to be 160 gigs now and now having an extra five or ten is going to be a big deal.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.480]   Now wild speculation.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   Good TV play-free eating.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   I like that.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   Right.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.960]   Or are they going to come up with a new device that is not necessarily a computer-ish device.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.280]   It's only going to have about 16 gigs worth of workable storage and inside there it's
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.920]   going to have to be able to run some subset of the Mac operating system.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.640]   I'm trying to think of ways in which that sort of savings is going to be significant
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.760]   and really, really translate to something useful.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.760]   You know, I know.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   Go ahead.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.880]   I was going to say that I'm dealing with that because as I look at really rebuilding my laptop
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:28.200]   with and replacing the drive, I have been strongly considering a 256 gig solid-state
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.400]   drive to swap out.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.360]   I've been very happy with my SSD.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.480]   I love it, but it's just not big enough.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.800]   So this gets back to exactly what Andy's talking about, which is that as I go down from the
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.320]   drive that I have, the 320 that I have now down to 256, I'm like, "Oh, I've got to squeeze
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.400]   it every little bit out of it.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   I've got to move all my-
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.280]   You know, a shameful secret.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.680]   I just ordered a 320 to take out that nice SSD that I like so much with my SSD.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.980]   It's 128.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:00.680]   And I just had to watch my weight so closely that I couldn't put a file cut on it.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   Things like that.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680]   So I couldn't put my pictures on it.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.280]   I had an external hard drive for my pictures.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.040]   Well, that's not what I want with a laptop.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.720]   And I have to admit, I've been moving all of my pictures out of my laptop because that's
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.920]   not what you want with a laptop.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920]   You know, I take too many.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.480]   I mean, like I took over the weekend, over the weekend I took 40 gigabytes of photos.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.240]   So I can't expect to be putting those all on my 5D, just choose up.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.280]   So Andy, how does this solve it though for a laptop?
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.880]   Because you don't have two drives or do you?
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.200]   Well, again, imagine that there's a device, be it a laptop, be it whatever, where it's
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.240]   not implied that you're going to have, you're going to be able to put a 320 gigabyte drive
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.880]   in there or for the price point you want to sell it at, you won't be able to include
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.520]   256 or even 160 gigabytes worth of storage.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   That's one possibility.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.640]   Again, I keep looking for reasons why they would even bother trying to slim down the
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.160]   install because again, that's again, it's such a 1992, such a 1998 sort of thing.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   Oh, I think you're right.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   I'm almost here.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:05.320]   The second thing, and this is also comes under the heading of wild speculation.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.520]   I'm starting to wonder if I also remember that Apple is being really, really open about
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.000]   saying that, hey, this is not a landmark release.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.600]   We're just putting in lots of little improvements, lots of little fixes.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.000]   And maybe the $29 price point bears that out.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.320]   But again, most of the above the fold, above the headline new features they put on the site
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.360]   is we've really, really goost up the performance of this operating system.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.400]   A, B, again, it's $29.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.760]   It makes me wonder if the purpose of Snow Leopard is just to set the stage for 10.7.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.480]   If there's going to be a really, really awesome new technology or an awesome new interface
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.000]   that requires a lot of new infrastructure, that requires that we don't simply give away
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.520]   the top 20% of bandwidth of that processor, that we get every ounce of performance out
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.080]   of that process that we can.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.400]   And it's going to be so important that there at some level, they thought, I know it's traditional
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.160]   that we charge this much for the operating system, but we need to make absolutely sure
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.440]   that everybody running 10.5 upgrades to 10.6.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.080]   We need to have that we need to have a clear path to this new thing we're going to do.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.400]   We want to make sure that everybody has this new infrastructure and this new performance
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.600]   built in and ready to go.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.120]   Maybe it's a set up for 10.6.5.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.440]   And again, that's just wild speculation.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.920]   Once again, I like it.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.840]   Well, speculation is some of this sometimes what I'm paid for.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.800]   You're answering important questions.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.520]   Why are they shrinking the system folder?
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.240]   And why are they pricing this so low?
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.880]   And I think those are both very reasonable speculations.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   And a third reason is I think this really is one of the biggest middle fingers that
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.760]   Apple has ever flipped towards Microsoft.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.000]   Well, I think that's part of it.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.960]   Especially when they're making the same damn mistakes with Windows 7 as they did with Vista,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.440]   where there are 17, like 17 different versions.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   It's very confusing.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.760]   The cheapest one costs, I think, $220.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.240]   Well, you can't get an upgrade for a family pack for $150 for $3.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   Okay.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.280]   That's not $29 and you have to buy $3.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:07.400]   But if a compare contrast to the similar deal that Apple is giving you, not only $50
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.720]   for $5, but they're also saying that if you are so far behind in your updates that you
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.360]   need to basically buy a brand new operating system, we will charge you $50 less than what
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.760]   Windows will charge you to upgrade to 7.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.640]   And not only will we give you that, we will give you the entire pack.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.440]   We will not just give you the operating system.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   We will give you every professional, sorry, not your professional, but every consumer
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   grade app that we sell, not a simple little photo editor and viewer, but we'll give you
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.920]   a photo, we'll give you a movie editor, we'll give you a keynote, we'll give you a page.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.600]   I think that's probably, I mean, that's the Occam's razor.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.040]   That's the simplest, most likely reason for the $29.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.000]   It's just saying, you know, they beat them, actually, they were going to beat them by
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.920]   a month, they beat them by two months almost, because October 22 for Windows 7, and they
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.160]   beat them by a factor of 10 on the price almost.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.720]   That's probably good enough.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:03.680]   Well, and I think that it's such a developer, it is such a great thing to see people all
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.000]   given a reason to upgrade immediately.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   You're like, so I don't have to think about, like as a developer, I can just say, here's
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   the deal.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.360]   This is compatible with Snow Leopard.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.080]   It is not compatible, you know, we're not going to worry about, it's cost $30 upgrade, you
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.240]   know, and I think that it's easy to say that at $29.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.000]   It's harder to say that at $129.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.400]   And so, anyway, I just think it's a great business model.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.760]   I think that it makes an enormous amount of sense, and it really helps not just Apple,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.200]   but a lot of the developers able to take full advantage of this operating system because
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.560]   you don't have to worry about backwards compatibility as much.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.560]   Would you agree, Andy?
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   I'd say so.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.200]   I think they're a lot of different.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.960]   As I said, I'm glad that I identified that so strongly as just a wild speculation.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.280]   There are a lot of good reasons for charging just $29 for it.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.560]   And I think that one of the primary ones was the realization that we are building this
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   as lots of little upgrades, not one simple one, not one single, I must have this feature,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   I must have the feature.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.600]   That's what got me in this conversation because when I hear what you, what Alex talks about
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.080]   with OpenCL and I, and services, and I hear what you're talking about with lots of nice
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.680]   little features, Apple could have billed this as they did with Leopard.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.720]   150 improvements.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.040]   They could have said this is $129 upgrade.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.480]   It sounds like this.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.520]   That's why I thought maybe there's more than just, it's just a polishing.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.200]   Well, but I think, I think also there's so much being done under the hood, I do think
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.280]   that one challenge that Apple has is that while I believe this is one of the biggest
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.880]   upgrades that Apple's done in many years, I think that it's hard to see the surface.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.040]   Well, but we said that about Leopard 2 was hard to see a lot of those fixes.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.920]   So, but I, well, I think Leopard in some ways created more problems than solutions.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.520]   So, I mean, there's a lot of cool things about Leopard, but you know, not Leopard, Apple's
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.520]   Vista.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.280]   I don't think we're going to look back on Leopard as one of their better operating systems.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   I think we're looking at Snow Leopard as what they actually, when they actually got it working.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.360]   That's a pretty big stick.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.640]   Well, I think, as a matter of fact, I think that Snow Leopard is the official end of the
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   development of Mac OS 10 1.0.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.980]   That's the point at which this is an absolutely finished, absolutely mature.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.840]   Every idea that we would have been able to put in if we've been developing this since
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.280]   1990, 1991 is now in here, which is not to say that's the end of the road.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.640]   But I'm saying that it's sort of like the final act of a really good epic movie where
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.320]   the tanks have been destroyed, the girl has been saved, the secondary hero has been killed
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.280]   heroically, and the lead hero is now safe and sound and in a hospital somewhere.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.040]   I mean, it's not the most exciting thing, but it wraps everything up, takes care of every
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.840]   little detail that still needs needed to be attended to for the past x days, hours or
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   years, and basically says that we're done with this.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   Great.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   We're done with 1.0.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.360]   Now we start losing sleep over the next really good iteration of Mac OS 10.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.920]   Next week, we're going to be talking a lot about Leopard.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.320]   So I'm going to kind of terminate the conversation at this point because we have so much more
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.080]   to talk about new tablet rumors from the Wall Street Journal of all places, a new Apple
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.360]   ad that we've got.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.720]   Apple's response to the FCC.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.960]   There's a lot of stories here.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.400]   I'd like to have you seen the new Apple ad yet?
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   They're great.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   I love them.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.440]   But we have to do a paid for ad, a real ad as opposed to the Apple ad.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.240]   Our own app gets their free ads, but we're going to have to do a real idea real quickly.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.960]   And then we'll get to we'll get to those.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.760]   There's don't even get a pre hat out of it.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.360]   I'm not getting nothing.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.640]   I just play them.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   I give it to them.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   I do want to mention carbon.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.560]   This actually is a good time to talk about carbonite.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.880]   You've probably heard me for a long time on the radio show talk about carbonite for windows.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.600]   They have a Mac version now.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.040]   Does require Intel.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.840]   But this is if you're going to go to snow leopard, I think now is a very good time,
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.600]   at least to get the trial version of carbonite.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.920]   Start that backup so that when snow leopard arrives on Friday or next week, you've got
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.120]   a good solid backup and you can install with impunity.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.840]   Carbonite is backup done right.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.520]   It's backup over the internet.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.800]   So what happens you install carbonite and immediately starts backing up those irreplaceable
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.680]   files, your photos, your music, your financial documents, your emails, whatever it is that
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.360]   you cannot lose.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.200]   It does it in the background automatically.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.360]   Now it doesn't do it instantly because it's using your internet connectivity.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.800]   So this is the time to start with that free trial of carbonite.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.440]   Get it backing up so that you don't have to worry when you install snow leopard.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.880]   Of course, there's a lot of reasons to get carbonite.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.680]   If your student going off to school, the guy who created carbonite, David friendly, his
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.760]   daughter was a college kid, lost her papers, you know, important, I don't know if it was
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.680]   her thesis or something and freaked out and David said, "There's got to be a better way."
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.600]   He invented carbonite as a response to that.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.160]   So great to send a kid off to school with so that, you know, you're not look.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   You know your teenager.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.040]   They're not going to be backing up.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.320]   Let it do it for them automatically.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:55.200]   Unlimited backup over the internet, fully encrypted using AES and SSL, double encrypted.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.280]   Click restore for less than five bucks a month.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.400]   It's $54.95 a year for unlimited backup.

[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.880]   Use TWIT as the coupon code.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.280]   And I'd invite you to do it now to get ready.

[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.160]   months.

[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.680]   For that price, less than five bucks a month for that kind of peace of mind, that's worth
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   it.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.800]   It's less than a couple of triple tall lattes.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.400]   Speaking of which, did you bring in triple tall?
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   I didn't.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   I didn't bring one next time.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   I'll bring one next time.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.240]   I'm going to have to make a rule, you know.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.000]   I could be one of those people that says you can't, you know, if you come to the studio,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.840]   you bring triple tall lattes.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   That can be a rule like that.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.960]   And for now on, on Tuesdays, you'll have your triple tall lattes.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   I love those.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   You got me hooked on them.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   They're good.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.280]   Single tall latte at Starbucks is just not worth it.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.840]   The only bad thing about triple tall lattes, I actually don't get to sleep to have four
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   in the morning.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.920]   That night, I can't sleep.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.760]   Here's all I can say is if you do that, if you do that for a couple months, you'll find
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.600]   that it doesn't really affect you at all.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.360]   Yeah, your body will react.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.560]   And then, and then you'll be fine.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.000]   Same, the same is true about whacking your hand with a claw hammer.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.120]   After a while, the nerve endings just die off.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   You don't feel it.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.160]   You don't feel the thing.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.920]   Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.720]   We thank them so much for their support there.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   I think they're new.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   Is this their first time?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.320]   I think this is their first time on Mac Brick Weekly.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.000]   And they've been big support of the radio show on Twitch in general.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.640]   It's now a great time on Mac Brick Weekly.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   All right.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.400]   I think how many new ads are there for the Apple?
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   I think there's just two.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.400]   I think so.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.960]   All right, we'll play one right now.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.280]   This is the one I like called Top of the Line.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   Hello, my man.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   I'm a PC.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.640]   And I'm looking to buy a great computer.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.680]   Well, allow me to introduce the top of the line, PC.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   Hey.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   Cool.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.400]   Well, I want a computer with a big screen.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   Look, no further.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.400]   And a really fast processor.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   Some say I'm too fast.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.720]   And I want one that just works without thousands of viruses and tons of headaches.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.120]   Look, waitie.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.520]   Any PC you get's going to have those problems.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.160]   Well, I think I'll go with Mac.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   Crayons.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.200]   When you're ready to compromise, you call me.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:17.840]   When you're ready to compromise, you call me.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.640]   That's a good line.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.520]   You know, there's a lot of women who want to settle down, but then there's a lot of women
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.440]   who just want to settle.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.320]   That's a smooth.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.440]   You're ready to.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.320]   I love it, smooth.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.480]   That's a Apple Apple hired the tick.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   It's awesome.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.160]   The ticks and Brock Sampson.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   And putty.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   He was putty on Seinfeld, wasn't he?
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.720]   He was a Elaine's boy.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.800]   If you get tick, that's your that, you know, you get the tick.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   That's your show.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   You get Brock Sampson.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   Also, that's your show.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.240]   You get them both together.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.960]   For God's sake, you got a QVC show.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.760]   He was so smooth and he had the red tie and the little handkerchief showing.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   Oh, man.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.760]   Smooth.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:05.640]   So I think that these really dig deep, you know, I mean, in a lot of ways and maybe just
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.120]   from my point of view, but.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.360]   Well, this is about the HP ad, obviously.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   Absolutely.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   This is this is the laptop hunter.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   In fact, she even looked like the laptop.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.040]   But I think it cuts the legs right out from under those, you know, because what happens
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.360]   is you play that enough and people will have that in the back of their head when they're
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   watching the.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   Well, they need to.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.520]   They need to respond to those laptop hunter.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.880]   This is a good response.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   Very.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.040]   Hey, I'm a beautiful, beautiful, good looking machine.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Are you ready to settle?
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   I'll be here.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:37.840]   R.A.M. which stands for memory, which makes it suitable for cutting video.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:45.760]   Oh, I said don't you don't think there's a little bit of karma risk saying no viruses,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   no security flaws.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   They've been doing that.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.760]   They've done that before.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.680]   I mean, this isn't the first time that Apple has has gone into this.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.760]   We don't have a lot of viruses.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.520]   I mean, this is not this is this is a this has been for a year or two in these ads.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.080]   We've seen them talk about virus.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   Makes me so nervous.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.440]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.720]   I mean, obviously they do have security risks and there are some potential viruses, but
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   there it is.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.440]   There isn't that kind of problem on the max side, but it just makes me nervous to kind
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.760]   of call attention to it.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   It's like, but I guess that's the selling point.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.480]   In fact, for, I think, for a long time, a few years ago, we were mad at them for not
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   selling it.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.480]   Right.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   We said, why don't they mention it?
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.120]   And when it becomes a problem, I think that we can talk about it, but it's just, you know,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.000]   and it's still a small part of the market.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.160]   I think that's part of it as well.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.160]   They're not a target.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.560]   That's really the reason, but that's fine.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.720]   Why not sell it?
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   That's your selling point.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.760]   Look, nobody can gain say the fact that when you have a Windows machine, it suddenly all
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.360]   becomes all about protecting it.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.040]   And as a Mac user, you know, when I'm on the window side, the one thing that I don't
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.960]   touches the the Internet's.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.400]   It's not that bad.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.840]   I literally, I work on my PC applications, and then I go back to the Mac, and then I go
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.520]   surfing, and then I, and then I, the PC side, like we had, we had in a production, we had
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.760]   one time had some, one of the interns actually went up on the Internet on one of our PCs.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.840]   And yeah, we, we blew the whole PC out.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   We should point out, and this doesn't gain say what's in the app, but Apple does now
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.320]   include malicious software scanning and downloads.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.480]   Snow Leopard has a malicious software scanner.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.040]   In the background, just in the background and up downloads.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.960]   You know, if I'm Apple, and I want to continue to sell as no security problems, no viruses.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.720]   I got to keep on, I got to keep ahead of the game.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   And it's way easier.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.920]   I will say it's way easier in many ways for Apple to do this when there's not a thousand
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.280]   of them coming at them.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.760]   You know, so being able to attack these one at a time rather than window, you know, Microsoft
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.680]   having to attack a thousand at a time makes it easier for them to, you know, launch it.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.480]   They've been a little slow sometimes, but it's easier to stay ahead of it.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   I'll play the other one.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   Hello, Mac.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   I'm looking to buy a great computer.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   Oh, great.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.280]   I go with a PC.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.960]   But I want one that just works without thousands of viruses and a ton of headaches.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   That's a PC.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   Really?
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.920]   I thought Macs were much more stable and secure than PCs.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.160]   They're not.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.960]   You can't believe everything you hear.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.920]   I'm going to think about it.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.880]   Just get a PC.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.280]   Man, never ends.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   I don't even want to ask.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.760]   Of course that was PC pretending to be Mac.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.960]   My only my only critique of the mission impossible take take off is that I didn't think that
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.480]   the face transition was very good.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   They use an edit.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.800]   I was a little I was a little bummed.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   I know.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.600]   This isn't allowed me to be able to be deeper to your Cisco.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.080]   See, I thought I thought they broke it because they should have put Mac on the left side instead
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.640]   of on the right side.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   It just low.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   You're right.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.000]   It looks a little weird to have the Mac guy speaking anti Mac, even though you sort of
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.920]   suspect what the reveal is going to be.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.320]   He should be on the left where just where he should be on the left.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   So hot.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   Usually is.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   And you're sort of, Hey, what's going on here?
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.720]   And it's just they're starting to break it a little bit.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.320]   They break it a little bit when they bring in when they bring in the tick to like make
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.680]   it to be like the PC.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   Okay.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   Way to break it.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   It's not it's not a bad.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.280]   You know, how's been probably one more money and they're just they're just given a little
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   nut.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.360]   She's a little legendary diva that hodgman.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.480]   He probably said, I, you know, this is going to cost you more.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.680]   And they said, well, we've got the tick.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.320]   I do not know if you're not.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:21.120]   If you want to see anybody on my set with a Fiji water, I am going to be in my trailer.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:28.160]   No, I mean, it's I think what makes those commercials work is the fact that PC is really
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.200]   a love a loveable loser sort of persona where you sort of feel sorry for him.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   You don't you don't like, Oh, he's the he's the jerk.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   He's evil.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   He's not evil.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   He's not evil.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.800]   He's just frustrated because he really can't.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.600]   He doesn't really he doesn't have a way to fight against this.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.400]   That's the character that they really should maintain.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.920]   I mean, it's it almost feels like any good sitcom in the third or fourth season when
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.800]   they've done so many stories with these limited list of characters that they start to sort
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.000]   of forget what makes the individual character work.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.160]   It's a lousy edit.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.160]   Also, I wonder I wonder which of the two who got to take the mask home?
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.160]   Why?
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.520]   It's even a Justin long mask.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.120]   It looks like here's thing is he's not even pulling off his head.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   It's in front of his head.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   Look at it.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   It's in front of his head.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   Look at it.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   It doesn't look like Justin.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   No, look, it's just in front of his head.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   He didn't even pull it off.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   Yeah, that's cheesy.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.960]   Yeah, I guess they do cheesy things.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.520]   But if you're going to if you're going to do the whole mission impossible thing, we need
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.960]   to see a little stretch against the skin and we need to at least pull something off of
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   his head.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.400]   It sounds it sounds like a challenge to somebody in the community.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   Dude, you better do this better.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   That's all right.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   We have computers.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.640]   You could probably like even like do some morphing.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   This isn't even as good as it was in the sixties with mission impossible.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   Okay.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.920]   So we I think I think was as good as it needed to be.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.840]   This is good as good as it needed to do.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.560]   It didn't pull me out of the reality that they were trying to build.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:58.920]   The part of the cinematography of this is to judge the balance between light and dark.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:04.120]   And within that milieu, I felt as though I was willing to buy what this director was
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   selling.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   Okay.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.760]   So he's got the hand.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   He's got the elbow.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.400]   Oh, this is a brutal.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   Okay.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.280]   See, then they cut the cut and the mask goes back into the head.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.680]   He's got a piece of plastic.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.040]   Yeah, no, that's not good.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   It's not even on him.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040]   It's not even on him.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.640]   No, we could we need a little stretch.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   We need a little latex.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.280]   Well, you know, you know what happened?
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.880]   They started with like they took a life cast of the actor.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   Okay.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.800]   And then they realized that of course, well, we can't just use this as a mass because,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.080]   you know, husbands, his head is quite a bit bigger than this other person's.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.600]   Again, I didn't I didn't it's not it's it didn't make me go out and buy a PC.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.320]   Let's let's let's start with that.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   Okay.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   That's good for that reason.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   It was amusing.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.560]   Also, anything's going to be again, let me go.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560]   Let me let me reiterate.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   Okay.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.080]   The other one had the tick and Brock Samson.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   And putty just as a.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.960]   Yeah, that was pretty good.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   What's going to look good?
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   Chance to that.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.560]   Yeah, that the fact we we probably shouldn't even mention this other one.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.280]   So okay, Alex, here's your here's your pixel court challenge.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   I know I know.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   Pull the head off.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.560]   No, me.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.320]   I want to be on camera and do this and I want to be have Kevin Rose's head on your mind.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   Okay.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   Okay.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   So Kevin will be here.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   We have to get Kevin.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   Kevin will do the stretch.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   Well, we'll do it over white.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.520]   It's easier to do it over white.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.520]   We got it.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.520]   We'll come up.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.520]   We'll maybe do it.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520]   Maybe we'll get you guys.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   We'll get you in our chat room.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520]   I think it's exactly the right way.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520]   All right.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   So we got it.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   You got it.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.520]   You're going to do it.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   If you're doing Kevin to come play and then we'll work on it.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.640]   And then we have to somehow integrate it into a show.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   The end of Twit.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.280]   I could say another Twit is in the can.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   Right.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.640]   And you'll have been watching me the whole show because I'll be wearing the same shirt,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.240]   the same outfit, everything.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:47.280]   And then we'll we'll do a cut away from me to one of the guests cut back to the video
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.800]   of me.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.440]   Another Twit is in the can.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   Are we off?
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.680]   And then I'll pull this off and I'll be Kevin Rose.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   Okay.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   We'll work on it.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.240]   I got to call some I got to call some of my peeps.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   It's my turn.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.240]   Or should I be?
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   Who should I be?
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.640]   I think no, no, I think Kevin Rose would be perfect.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.640]   I think it's good.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.240]   But at the end you have to have you have to have some Kevin Rose mannerisms and I'll
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   drink a cup of tea.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   There you go.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   People will be like, what's going on?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   And what?
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.680]   Yeah, we'll just leave it like that.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   Yes.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.680]   I like it.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   All right.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   I like it.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   You know, might require a head cast.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.200]   Oh, I'm for that.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   A head cast.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   Oh, to make the mask.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.840]   I mean, you're like, go for a real mask.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   You're not going to do this.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   It's CGI.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.080]   No, you would do it right.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.280]   You need a head mask.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.040]   Now I'm understanding why they didn't do this app.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.720]   But it was, you know, I know that Apple doesn't have any money, but a head cast is not that
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   complicated.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.200]   You know, we're going to do it here for fun.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.040]   They probably didn't have Justin for that long.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040]   That's true.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   It is.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   I will say it's harder going.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.920]   It's easier going from you to Kevin than from over to you because your head sizes are
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   different.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   You have to have.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.080]   Oh, you got to go from the big head to the little easier to go from one, you know, one
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   to the other.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   Okay.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.280]   Not impossible, but so who's had his bigger probably hodgeman?
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.680]   He's got more brains than Justin.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.160]   So they really went the wrong way.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   It was just it would be.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   That's why they didn't do it.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.720]   Well, I still think all you needed was a little stretch.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.120]   You just needed a little stretch there.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   Okay.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:17.360]   And he can get up and he can say, God, how does he sit on that ball all day?
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.480]   People's going to retain and redesign the plastic MacBook family.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.600]   A lot of people wondering this.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.960]   I love this unit body design.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   It's fantastic.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.160]   The only plastic Mac laptop out there.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.840]   In fact, the only plastic Macintosh in any form or factor is the white plastic MacBook.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:37.720]   According to Apple insider, Mac books are going to stay white and plastic and 13 inches
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.920]   for some time to come.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:47.160]   A redesign is on the way though, a refresh of the kind of the base model of the Mac laptop.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.760]   I think that's great.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   I think it's nice to have a.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.680]   You need a sub 1000 or a 1000 dollar laptop.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.040]   And I think it does create that.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:01.200]   I think in that room or I think at least the one that they had, I think on Apple insider,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.160]   they were showing you really are getting this clear progression.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.880]   If a tablet existed somewhere between the iPhone and you have.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   Yes.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   That is nice.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.040]   It's perfect for $99 to $3,000.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.920]   And you have like even increments all the way up.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.840]   But apparently, Sremor is really solidified.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.080]   Now the Wall Street Journal just a little blurb said Steve Jobs is back at work.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:28.520]   Now, by the way, I think the Wall Street Journal has an Apple official conduit to Apple.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.600]   That's why they were the ones of the Steve Jobs liver transplant story.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.760]   They now say Steve Jobs is back to work and focusing all his attention on the tablet.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   Tablet.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.520]   I think that if you if you ask me, the journal has now really made this.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.120]   I mean, we all agreed it was going to happen, but this putting it journal.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.440]   It's going to be Fox News is the Republican Party.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.080]   The Wall Street Journal is the Apple.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   Yes.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   Exactly.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   They're the house organ.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.480]   Well, I think that I think that this is this tablet.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.800]   I think if that's true, I think it's showing you how important Apple and Steve Jobs thinks
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.000]   this tablet will be.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.480]   Why would they change their policy and leak it?
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   What is the benefits?
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.240]   It's just from a purely strategic point of view.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.040]   I understand the benefit of not leaking it.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.520]   You get all this speculation, but at some point you kind of want to.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.520]   Well, I think Apple's gotten very good at it.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.360]   I think what they control the story may have been.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.800]   Well, maybe that's what they're doing.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.520]   The idea is, is rather than have it be wild speculation all over the place, they can get
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.480]   it a little bit more focused, but keep people hungry for whatever this new thing, this new
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.120]   fangled device is going to be.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.240]   I mean, it's something that has been floating around for years.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:44.080]   I mean, they have rumored to be working on this for four or five years.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.760]   And so for the fact that it to only really get to the surface, to percolate to the surface
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.200]   now, they've done a pretty good job.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:58.080]   Also again, assuming that there is a backdoor conduit going on here, they definitely, if
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.560]   they're getting within, let's say five or six months of an actual release, they're going
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.680]   to want to make sure that they manage expectations for this device.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.160]   Because at this point, people can start floating rumors that, oh, and by the way, it's got,
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.680]   it's made, the case is made out of obsidasium.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.680]   So we'll just hover exactly where you leave it.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.680]   In mid-air, wherever you put it, it'll have not just a 3G, not a 4G, but a 5G network
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.600]   that actually has part of this data network.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.160]   Not only is it free, but it converts solar energy into electricity.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.960]   So it's actually putting electricity back into the grid.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.720]   So you will actually make money the more you use the internet on this device.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:39.120]   If at a certain point in the development of advice that is so heavily rumored like this,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.920]   you want to have a source of official-ish sounding things that they don't have to really
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.400]   back up, that they don't really have to ever defend because they never actually announced
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.400]   everything.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.000]   That keeps people's minds on the thing you're actually developing, not the thing that they
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.320]   want, that the consumers would have if all laws of economics and physics and business
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.080]   were rescinded for life this product.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:06.920]   Yeah, I think that that's a really good point because I think that that is one of the problems
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:13.440]   that Apple has had in the near past is the rumors get way ahead of the product and people
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.120]   have, people get kind of, "Well, it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be,"
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.240]   because all of the rumors started building up and people started, their imagination took
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.480]   over from whatever people were telling them about what it could be.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:30.120]   And I think that that is, 720p, for instance, in a small tablet is going to be a big challenge.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.760]   But if people started saying, "Well, it's actually going to be 1080p and it's going to
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.360]   be able to, and output to a plasma."
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.520]   So they really, at this point, want to start leaking details.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.080]   Just enough to keep people interested.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.680]   The great thing about not making any official announcement is they also don't have to tell
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.160]   anyone when it's going to be released.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.440]   So if they're still working on it, it allows them to keep positive control over the story
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:55.040]   without having to be caught up with, "Are we on time or late or anything else?"
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.440]   And here we're seeing one of the many advantages of them pulling out of the keynote position
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.680]   of January and Mac world.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.680]   Now that they don't, right now everybody would be simply assuming very correctly that, "Well,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.400]   they're definitely going to show off something."
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.640]   If we all think that they're going to be releasing it in 2010, they're definitely going to
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.920]   at least show it off, at least give some sort of a demonstration or preview in January.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.640]   Now they're absolutely free to, not care to, simply wait until it's absolutely right and
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   not show it until they're ready to show it.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.880]   We've got to get to our picks real quick.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:31.200]   A couple of other big stories, Apple responds to the FCC with a very, well, a kind of weird
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   response.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:37.640]   First of all, they said, "I think it's the kind of the Eddie Haskell response."
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.520]   We didn't block Google Voice.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.600]   We didn't do it.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.960]   We're studying it.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   We didn't say no.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:50.200]   We said, "For John Gruber," because Gruber quoted a source that said Apple hadn't rejected
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.840]   it, and he assumed that that source was saying AT&T rejected it.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.720]   In fact, what the source was saying was exactly what Apple said, "Well, they haven't yet
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.280]   rejected it."
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.400]   They just didn't put it in the store.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.120]   We have top men examining it right now.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   Ooh, they really parsed it.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.760]   Apple gave a lot of details about why they might reject, redefines the experience with
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.000]   a new voicemail.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.400]   We put a lot of energy into visual voicemail.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.240]   This replaces that, replaces our SMS experiences and get the little bubbles.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.120]   They actually explained a lot.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:29.920]   Google's response was, "Apple rejected it because redacted."
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.680]   And AT&T, also acting like a teenager, said, "We didn't do it.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   We didn't do it."
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.360]   This is not a good time to be pissing off Google, because they're coming up with much,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.080]   much better and much sharper online services.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.200]   They came up with Google Listen.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:50.840]   It's right now it's an Android-only phone app, but it could be one of the coolest podcatchers
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.560]   on any platform anywhere.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.760]   It's more like an audio aggregator than a simple subscription manager and men playlist
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   manager.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   What?
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   And Google Voice?
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   No, Google.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   It's called Google Listen.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   It's part of Google Lab.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   Oh, the Android Listen.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   No, I love Listen.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   I think it's really impressive.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.320]   Have they made a move to put that on the iPhone?
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.160]   Of course, it wouldn't be approved.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:17.880]   Well, they've also said that if Apple is not going to prove Google Voice, they'll just
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.240]   make a server-side version of it and do it as a web app.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:29.680]   But it does make you wonder if Google stops seeing Apple as people who make hard Apple
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.760]   as a -- if they stop seeing Apple as a conduit towards the sort of users that they want for
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.760]   their web servers and start seeing them as an obstacle that has to be worked around,
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.080]   and the next step after that is saying, well, what would -- how would it be to our advantage
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:48.360]   to create a service that works on every single platform except for Apple's iPhone?
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   It's something to worry about.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.040]   Again, the first one, when I got my -- when I got my hands on Google Listen for the first
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.520]   time, I'm like, wow, this would be even better on the iPhone.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.960]   Oh, wait, it doesn't work on the iPhone.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   It does some neat things.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.320]   You could search for a topic and find podcasts that talk about that topic.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.520]   I mean, yeah, I agree.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.520]   I'm with you.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.760]   I think this is a really, really great app.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.640]   Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the kind of thing Apple would ever allow.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.200]   Although they do allow -- there is a pretty good pod catcher, RSS, what's it called,
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.080]   RSS reader, RSS feeder.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:25.320]   I wonder if there would be a good idea to have a paid position at Apple of people -- someone
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:30.360]   who is just -- who was that idiot who used to be the mouthpiece for the motion picture,
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   so Jack Valenti.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.160]   If Apple were to designate somebody as the Jack Valenti, the person who gets to go out
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.760]   and explain things.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.400]   Yeah, and we will tell you -- we will give you exactly what needs to be said, and we
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.120]   will be able to tell you things that we wouldn't ordinarily simply give to the press with the
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.800]   provision that everybody knows you're just a stooge who says what we says.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.120]   And that not only that, but if anything really, really cool were happening that we definitely
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.800]   didn't want anybody to know about, the last thing we would do would be to tell you.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:01.320]   So that -- I mean, they would at least have even a BS conduit to explain a human face
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.960]   on the decisions that Apple makes would be better than no face whatsoever, or at least
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.400]   the floating face of the Wizard of Oz, which is what we have at the moment.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   Right.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.080]   We've got questions, motives of the app store, approve a process.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:23.360]   You must bring me a bucket of water from Odin's spittake valve.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   They have 40 people approving the application.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   As fast as possible.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.600]   Well, and I just saw a number that was huge, like 40 people have to do something like a
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.960]   800 -- no, 1,000 applications a day they have to look at twice.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.360]   So the two people look at it.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.520]   So it's a huge number.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.520]   It's really undoable.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:51.720]   It's the handmade craftsmanship that comes through in every single Apple approved.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.920]   But I think it's a sweatshop.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:57.360]   But I think a lot of them -- my guess is that a lot of the apps are very quick like, "Oh,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360]   yeah, that works."
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.360]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.240]   I don't know because, okay, Facebook has updated its Facebook app.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.800]   They did it last -- it's been seven days at least since they announced we've got an update.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.400]   It still hasn't appeared in the store.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.600]   Now, you'd think that'd be kind of a no-brainer.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.840]   You think they have to sit and really examine every detail of the Facebook app before they
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   can update.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.360]   Not even a new app.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.360]   Right.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.360]   I don't know.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.200]   I think that they -- I don't know if there's any automatics.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.520]   Well, I don't mean that there's automatics, but I don't think that many -- when you think
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.240]   about 40 people doing, it means that they have to go through 25 applications a -- 25 applications
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.040]   a day, which would mean that they'd have to go through, you know, about --
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.440]   I have the number here somewhere.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.680]   So, say they have to go three or four an hour there.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   Before that.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   It's more than that.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   It's huge.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.680]   It's more than 1,000 a day?
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   Well, I should have bookmarked this story.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   I don't know.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.880]   I didn't -- I thought it was 1,000 a day.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   Maybe it isn't.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   Maybe it isn't.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   App Store applications.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.280]   You know, there's one that I hope they put through, but I don't think there's a chance
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.440]   of them getting this in.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   Rhapsody.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   No, it's submitted.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.080]   That's not going to happen.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.960]   Rhapsody has submitted an iPhone application.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   Why?
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   Well, it was a Rhapsody, I guess.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.520]   I guess putting a line in the sand saying, "Look at what they did to us."
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:10.760]   It's kind of like when someone in soccer falls, when someone ran by them.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.200]   I think that's why Rhapsody is actually --
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   Oh, he hit me.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.880]   Yeah, and then they fall on the ground and they hold their leg and they go, "Ah!"
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.800]   You know, that's kind of what Rhapsody's doing there.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   If you had a $15 a month Rhapsody account, you could listen to your Rhapsody music on
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   your iPhone.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   Hmm.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.800]   Boy.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:34.600]   Boy, I sure -- there's video of it on Engadget.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.440]   I sure love to have this.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.960]   I just -- yeah, you're right.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.960]   There's just no way.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.800]   There's just no way they're going to introduce this.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.160]   They'll allow this.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.160]   Apple's not crazy.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.160]   Do you see the new pre-ads, by the way, instead of doing the creepy lady?
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.480]   Now they look exactly like the iPhone ads.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.560]   There's an app that might as well say there's an app for it.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.320]   8,500 a week.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.200]   Okay, thank you, Icat.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:03.320]   So 8,500 applications a week, you've got 40 people reviewing them.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:08.800]   So that's 210 applications, but they have to be a week that have to be reviewed.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.400]   That's 30 a day, but it's more than that because two people have to look at it.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.760]   So that's 60 a day you'd have to look at.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.200]   In an eight-hour day, that's a lot.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.080]   Could you look at eight-seven or six or seven apps at an hour?
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.680]   It would make me a little crazy.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   Make you crazy.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:26.640]   But the thing is, I guess I would say that it's number one.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.760]   We don't know how -- it's really that number.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.280]   That's a big number.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.360]   But the other thing is, is that I think that there are ones that -- when I buy apps and
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:41.040]   I buy a lot of them, I make a lot of decisions about that application in three or four minutes.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.560]   You know about what it can do, what it can't do, and especially if I had a list, probably
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.000]   when they're testing it, there's a little list, like, "Check this, check this, look at this,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.120]   check this, look at this, boom."
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:56.920]   So I mean, spend -- I think that for an average application that is a heart rate monitor,
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.480]   I don't think that they're looking that deeply into it.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   Let's face it.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.680]   They could hire more people.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.640]   They must hire people as needed.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:10.080]   You're not going to kill somebody, but making them look at eight applications a day, 20 applications.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   You're not going to do that or now.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.800]   But it just depends on what it's testing for, too.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.320]   It could be like hook it in, make sure that it's not talking to back to the server or sending
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   certain information back to the server.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.120]   It would explain how many stupid mistakes they've made.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.240]   Well, I mean, I think that there -- with that many going through, I think that no matter
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.600]   what happens, you're going to have a certain level of problems.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.520]   But I don't -- I think that when you're not testing it for how great the application is,
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.920]   but just how does it fulfill whatever the basic requirements are, I think you could go through
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   them pretty quickly.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.440]   It also underscores AT&T's position that Apple doesn't ask us.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.880]   There's no way Apple could ask them.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   They're not thinking.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:46.120]   I guess you could -- if it raises a red flag, you could ask them.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:52.200]   I'm sort of -- someone was telling me about how at least one part of the medical business
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:58.600]   works where when you have a screening or test that involves just the MRI film, oftentimes
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.680]   it's sent to an industrial park where people are paid sort of piecemeal to look at these
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   images.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.840]   They're not terribly experienced.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.920]   They just know what constitutes an absolutely clean, absolutely no questions about it, perfectly
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.120]   healthy scan.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.600]   And so they're sort of given a list of things where if you see anything that is not exactly
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.360]   this rejected or a flag it's saying this needs to be passed on to somebody who's more
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.800]   experienced or has more -- someone who's better at this.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.520]   And that sort of -- that story comes to mind when I think about how App Store apps are
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   processed.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:33.360]   It's possible that they're not making a very, very -- well, it's our job as -- as I've seen
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.560]   themselves as editors, so to speak, and gatekeepers, they're simply given a list of things that
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.920]   are automatic, just don't even worry about it, just kill it and then go on to the next
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.480]   one that show stoppers.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.240]   I think that's a lot of these things.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:49.560]   A lot of these problematic apps are just simply tripping automatic rejection buttons.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.760]   Well, I think also it's that they -- I don't think we want them to look at them any closer
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.520]   because we think that we want them to kind of just let through most of the applications
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.280]   unless there's a really big red flag.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.240]   So you're looking for porno and that's about it.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:09.080]   So, Apple has released -- if you had that clicking problem, I don't know, I haven't, but apparently
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:13.640]   some people had a clicking problem with their Mac Pro hard drives and Mac with Pro hard drives.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:18.440]   Apple has released a firmware update last Wednesday for some of the 7200 RPM drives,
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:22.400]   the June 2009 MacBook Pro systems.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.960]   It will apparently reduce certain infrequent noises.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.000]   Mate, we had some guys in the office that took theirs back for that.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   Really?
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.400]   I think we have a firmware update to fix that, but there is a fix.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   Come back with your picks of the week, Andy and Alex, prepare yourselves.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   Gird your loins.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.880]   Oh, you know.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.320]   If you have loins that are unguarded, you might want to gird it.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.080]   Yeah, you know, we are for whatever reason.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:57.360]   But right now it's time to tell you about our good friends at AUDIBLEaudible.com, the
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:03.520]   place to get audio books, audio entertainment, enjoyment for the masses.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.760]   Lovely stuff.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.120]   You go to audible.com/macbreak, your first one's for me.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   And we always like to give you some suggestions for books you might want to listen to.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   But you know what?
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:17.240]   Before I get your suggestions, Andy, and I'm sure you have a good one, I just do recommend
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.600]   going to the audible homepage because they've really made it increasingly a great place
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.680]   to browse looking for new books.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.840]   It's really gotten to be more and more like a bookstore where there's suggestions, recommendations,
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.600]   the top downloads of the week.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   If you hover, this has that Netflix thing where if you hover over a book cover, you'll
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.680]   get a synopsis of it, all the kind of basic information, then you can go deeper.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.280]   You can listen to samples.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.720]   They've made this as pleasant an experience as going to a real bookstore.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.160]   You really can browse and enjoy.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.640]   So even if you're not interested in any particular book or you maybe you don't even know if
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   you want to try audible, just go to the website and take a look.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:59.720]   You know, even if you like written printed books, it's a good way to find a new book
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.000]   to read audible@audible.com/macbreak.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.840]   What are you reading, Andy?
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.720]   Anything new that you'd like to share with us?
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.000]   New to me to audio, hopefully new to most people listening in.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.120]   This is a Shahra's space by Wally Shahra is a book that I read about 10 years ago when
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.280]   I was on a jag where every Mercury, Gemini or Apollo related book I could find I would
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.240]   have to buy and read.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:32.320]   And it's one of those really, really great personal astronaut biographies where you're
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.120]   getting the really early guys, wasn't he?
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.120]   He was one of the original Mercury 7 and that sort of tagged him as an especially interesting
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.400]   individual because what we forget is that most people know that the original Mercury
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:51.680]   7 and most of the subsequent classes of Gemini and Apollo astronauts were taken from the
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.080]   test pilot core.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.800]   People and really hot, not only hot shot pilots but hot shot engineers, people who really
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.680]   know what how flight works and how to really analyze things correctly.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:06.440]   But the original Mercury 7 had an extra little twitch about them in that nobody in the military
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.080]   knew what would happen to your career if you spent X number of years in this brand new
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   space program.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.000]   So linear sort of if you really wanted a career in the military you wanted to retire as a one
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.040]   star general or as a colonel or with your own command.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   There is sort of a progression.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   Well first you get this posting then you get to that posting then you go to test pilot
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.840]   school then you get posted here then you get this experiment.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.320]   Nobody knew what would happen to your career if you went into the space program.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.520]   So the seven people who became the Mercury 7 were very, very, were really quite unique
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520]   individuals.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.360]   They weren't they certainly weren't there for the glamour of the posting.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.760]   They just wanted to be the people who got accepted because they knew it was a very competitive
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   sort of thing.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.720]   Scharaw got a reputation amongst the Mercury 7 as not only an extremely skilled pilot and
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.600]   extremely skilled engineer but he would not take any crap from anybody.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.040]   Not the scientists, not the doctors, not the engineers.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.280]   It was all about producing a good spacecraft and a successful mission.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:05.000]   And so it's no it's really no no accident that to his two most particular flights he
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.160]   got a Mercury flight after Scott Carpenter's mostly fail build Mercury flight because they
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.160]   needed somebody who would when the reason why Scott Carpenter's carpenters flight supposedly
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.160]   landed down range.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.160]   He ran out of fuel.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.560]   He got all kinds of problems because he was the sort of person who was really interested
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.600]   in oh yes if a doctor said we really want you to put in this extra sensor.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.280]   We really want you to run this extra experiment.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.880]   They'd say yes bring it on board.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   While he was a guy said no.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.240]   I'll screw up my timetable.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.440]   It's another thing to go wrong.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.440]   It's nothing.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.000]   I won't allow that at my spacecraft.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   For the same reason after the Apollo one fire the first return to space after that was Apollo
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.240]   seven he was given command of Apollo seven because again within the hierarchy they knew
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.800]   that he would ensure a successful mission not only because of his skills but also because
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.960]   he would not allow anything onto that schedule that would screw that would be ancillary to
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:01.080]   the purpose of getting this Apollo spacecraft tested out for the first time in space and
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.680]   basically making sure that NASA would have a nice full success in their hands.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.040]   It was also cool space flight because it was known as the first in space mutiny of an
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.560]   American astronaut crew because everyone got sick on board and so he was already sorting
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.200]   a bad mood and the ground was really like giving him all these like what he felt to be
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.400]   unreasonable demands and finally he just basically made it very very clear and very on NASA
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.160]   astronaut sort of tones that here is where you can stick the following eight commands
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   you've given me.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.520]   They're not on the flight pan.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.040]   I know you think they're important but I'm the guy.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   What are you going to do?
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.160]   Come on up here and take the controls away from me.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.640]   If you think you can do that I know it's going to be expensive for you to even try.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.600]   So why don't we just pretend I'm in command of this mission.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   That's awesome.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.600]   So it's not a biography.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.360]   So it really is in his words.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:00.080]   Basically the tone is not that well the difficulty of the Saturn 1B stage was in the refueling
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   valve.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.080]   They rerouted.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.200]   It's more like but it's more about here is what it was like to be there.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.840]   Who would have liked to train for these missions here what this team of seven people were like
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   working together and here's what it was like to try to prepare and execute an absolutely
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.040]   flawless space flight and again all of his flights were absolutely perfect.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.920]   So they definitely had the right man for that particular job.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   That's neat.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   What a great sounding book.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:28.080]   I'm going to have to get this Shiraz space by Wally Shiraz read by Richard Rohan.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.600]   Now that could be your free book but there's 60,000 titles.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.880]   Don't feel limited anything that you see there.

[01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:00.160]   I will start my pick today is something boy this was a nice treat the other day I came
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.480]   home and I admit I'm susceptible to bribes.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:11.120]   I came home and there was a box for me inside was some software and some delicious ginger
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.680]   chews like little brownies.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.080]   They were so good and the whole family ate them.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:20.320]   I took a great risk feeding them to my family and we loved them and inside was a note from
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.080]   the author of this program saying you know I just thought I'd give it a shot.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.560]   I'd like you to take a look at the program.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.080]   Maybe my wife's shoes would would help ease the pain.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:36.480]   I thought well at least after eating his delicious desserts I ought to take a look at
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.280]   the software and lo and behold it's actually really great.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.560]   Now this it sounds like I think one of the reasons I didn't take a look at it when it
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.920]   first came around.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.240]   It's called pair note from useful fruit.com.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.720]   One of the reasons I didn't take a look at it when it first came around is because I
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:55.200]   thought oh not another notebook program for the Mac.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.200]   How many do we need?
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.880]   I've been really happy with Evernote.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:02.720]   I see no reason to change so I just really wasn't willing to take a look at a new notebook
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.720]   program.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   But this isn't another notebook program.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.200]   It's kind of very different.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   If you go to meetings and you take notes or if you're a student and that's why I'm mentioning
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.320]   this now everybody's going back to school.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.360]   If you're a student and you take notes this is a great solution for you.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:26.280]   It records using the microphone or the built-in camera on your laptop, the audio of the lecture
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:33.520]   or the meeting side by side with a text window so that you can write down notes.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.920]   You can click kind of what program does this?
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.600]   Oh that one with a pen where you write and then you click.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.040]   That's actually what I have.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.840]   I was just saying this is a lot like that but I could definitely see myself wanting to use.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.800]   I'm not going to use a pen because my hand ranks terrible.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:54.960]   What this does is you record the audio or the video and then you can as you're in the
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.040]   meeting take notes.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.240]   It'll be tied to the recording.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.200]   It'll jump to that part of the recording.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.360]   You can go back and listen, go through your notes, supplement your notes.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.880]   I mean from now on when I go to meetings I'm going to have Perinote running in the background.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.280]   This is a really simple but very good idea.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.160]   I use my little pen and I can't think of it right now.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.840]   My little pen a lot.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.480]   Do you use it specifically for?
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   What is it any?
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480]   I can't hear Alex's mic.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.640]   Oh I turned off Alex's mic.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   I'm so stupid.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   I use my live-scribe.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   Live-scribe.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   That's a lot.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   To do this.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.080]   Primarily what I use it for is meetings with clients.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.840]   One thing you have to remember in most states you need to tell people that you're recording
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840]   them.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840]   Don't just turn this thing on.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.960]   Say may I record this meeting.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.320]   There are two reasons for it.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.280]   One is I make sure that I don't forget anything that happened in the meeting.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.880]   Two is I make sure that they don't forget anything that happened in the meeting.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.920]   We're all on the same page about what we decided we were going to do.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   This is just going to help me to really help me.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.200]   I'm much more comfortable with a keyboard than I would be with a live-scribe pen.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   Same exact idea.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.520]   It matches up the audio or video which the live-scribe can't do.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.960]   To the notes that you've typed allows you to change.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.040]   By the way you can also embed slides from the keynote presentation or the PowerPoint
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   presentation.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.400]   There's a whole world of product that you could do with a class where you have someone
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.360]   sitting in the back with a camera feeding and they're putting in all the notes and then
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.120]   you have a link to class.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.280]   This would be so cool for that.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.560]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.640]   It's $39.99 if you want to buy it.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.560]   I'm actually going to pitch this to my daughter's school.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.800]   It's a high school everybody goes.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   My son is now in there too.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.640]   Gets a Mac book, one of the white Mac books when you matriculate for the four years.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.360]   This should be on every one of them.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.000]   I'd love to see this on the iPhone.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   I don't see it.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Well, I'll have to talk to him.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Paranote, yeah.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   I don't think it's an iPhone.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.520]   I take a lot of notes also with my iPhone.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   Yes.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.200]   It would be great to be able to do that as well.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200]   Got complete search.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.480]   It's got folders.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.240]   You can jump to the recording.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.800]   You can either recording to your PowerPoint keynote or PDF slides jump to that point.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.960]   So you can see what the slides were.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.800]   I mean, this is just a very clever little application, not another notebook.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:21.600]   Paranote, it's from usefulfruit.com, which is I think a great name for a software company.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.400]   And by the way, when you get Paranote, you get the recipe for the ginger shoes.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.560]   So just a little ad bonus.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.680]   It's in the sample Paranote, I think.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.800]   Let's get Alex's pick of the week, Mr. Lindsay.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.360]   So I said I was going to move back to Mac App.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.480]   Another iPhone app, that's okay.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   That's okay.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   I'm trying to stop.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480]   That's okay.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   We'll forgive you.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.480]   I have two that I didn't need to talk about.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.480]   Two is good.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   Two.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480]   Okay.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480]   I think we should make that the rule if you do an iPhone app.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480]   You have to do two.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.480]   Okay.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   Okay.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   Okay.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.480]   So one of them I think I might have talked about, but I don't think that I didn't recommend last
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.480]   week.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480]   I don't believe I recommend a nutrition.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480]   I recommend something else.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   Work it on losing weight.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.480]   I've lost a little weight.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.480]   I have high.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.760]   You more successfully than I.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.640]   But it takes when I'm not on my diet, it takes a lot of effort to make sure that I'm
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.800]   staying on my diet and paying attention to how many calories I'm eating and so on and so
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   forth.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.960]   And it is very tricky.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.480]   So because you get a salad.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.360]   I got a salad at QuizNose without my iPhone, without nutrition handy.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.400]   I walked back and I looked at...
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.880]   I went to QuizNose.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.800]   Basically, what this nutrition guide has is every 1500...
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.120]   You just call nutrition.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.200]   I see nutrition menu and I see restaurant nutrition.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.680]   It is called nutrition menu.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Nutrition menu.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.720]   It is like 1500 of all of the major restaurants.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.800]   This is what happens in New York.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.240]   So basically, this is all the data that New York has.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.880]   You have it in your iPhone because you have to in New York, every restaurant has to publish
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.760]   it and I nearly stopped eating when I was in New York.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.400]   I mean, when I saw when I saw like a caloric intake.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.720]   I bought a salad at QuizNose that was 1000 calories.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.160]   I mean, right now I'm eating just a little bit more than that every day.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   Let alone the salad at lunch.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.120]   The salad shouldn't be 1000 calories.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.920]   Well, and so the thing is, is it allows me to go, "Oh, I'm in.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.880]   I'm at Taco Hell or I'm at Noah's or whatever."
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.200]   And I know exactly what I'm eating.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.360]   I went to in and out burger with my daughter and I was like, "Well, I'm only going to budget
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   about 250 calories."
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.840]   And I walked in and I found the burger protein style that I can order that fits inside of
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.600]   the diet that I'm on.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.920]   And I think that it totally revolutionized.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.720]   I wasn't as afraid of restaurants because I got to a point where I just wouldn't go,
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.320]   I wouldn't eat out because I just didn't know.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.800]   And I'm really trying to finish my little diet.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.120]   And it's $1.99 or whatever.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   $2.99.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.400]   And being able to have that there is just, it allows you to at least be conscious if that's
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   what you want.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.560]   Talking what you eat is I think the single best way, frankly, to lose weight.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.760]   It's always worked for me.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.680]   The problem with these is not having enough choices in there.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.240]   This says it's the biggest database in there.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.480]   It's not just restaurants either, right?
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.800]   You could enter in snow peas.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   It doesn't have to be.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   I think so.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   I haven't tried that.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.600]   I mostly use it when I'm in restaurants because when I'm at home, I'm eating out of the nutrition
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.000]   system kind of plan and so I don't think about it.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.960]   So the second one that I wanted to recommend, and this is something that Sumash was put
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.680]   up that I just, it's just incredible.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.480]   It's called Hitchcock.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   And it is.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480]   Now this one's a little more expensive.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   This is like 20 bucks.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.680]   And what it does is it lets you build storyboards on your iPhones.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.880]   So you can sit here and you can go, okay, I got a camera.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.160]   I can go for my photo library or I can go, you know, I can take a picture of, let's see,
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.920]   I can take a picture of Leo here.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.280]   I'm in this movie now.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.680]   You're going to be in my movie.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.520]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   Okay.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:50.400]   So now I have a picture of Leo and I can say use that picture and then it's going to pop
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   up.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.720]   Okay, cancel that.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.680]   So now I have, you know, I have this picture here and I can say, okay, I want to, you know,
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   pan in on him.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.240]   You can show it to camera too if you want.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.200]   So I, camera two is right there.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.280]   So there's like a little, there's like a little pan, like I want to, or I want to push
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.280]   into Leo.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.520]   So you show what the shot, so you can take a picture of the shot and you can actually
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   make the move.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.480]   And then what I did is I did a storyboard version.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.680]   It doesn't actually do the move, but you know, it allows me to do kind of a, say, or I can
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.160]   take Dolly to the side, you know, I can, I can drag something and it says, I want to
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.920]   Dolly from, you know, one side, you know, one side to the, you know, one side of the
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.920]   other.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920]   There you go.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.920]   And so you can add all those little bits, like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, throw it
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   together.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.600]   So if you're trying to, a lot of times what ends up happening is your, um, yoga, when
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.200]   we're scouting a location for a shoot, we might be thinking about, oh, the person could
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.440]   come over there and then they go over here.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.920]   So just take a bunch of photos and then on the flight home or on the drive home, you
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.200]   can just open up your iPhone and just throw a bunch of ideas together and then export,
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.080]   you know, send it out to, you know, and we're just starting to play with it.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.400]   It's just really, it's a slick little application.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.640]   And again, it's a little bit more expensive, but there's a lot of features here.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.760]   I mean, it's not a, you know, and it's a very, you know, a special, you know, unique
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.240]   audience for movie makers.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.080]   Anyway, there's a lot of them in the, it's called Hitchcock and, uh, and it is really,
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.480]   really, if 1999, and now Andy and not co with his pick of the week.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.960]   Uh, well, this, uh, there you go.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.880]   Well, this isn't my pick of the week, but, uh, given your pick and the ginger bars, I
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.120]   like to point out to Mac break, recent listeners and developers that, uh, almost Omaha steaks
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:34.800]   dot com, value quality, the gourmet banquet for five on top, sir, loins, two, five ons
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:40.000]   filet mignons for four, bornless pork chops, two stuffed soul whisk, all ups and crab,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.280]   eight gourmet, Frank's for gourmet, bourmet burgers, 10 potatoes, all gratin.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.200]   That's a lot of impact for 69, 90.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.800]   I mean, compare that to any ad buy on any podcast anywhere.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.400]   We have no delivery information available via email.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.360]   We will have the address.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:00.120]   I really, I didn't want to imply that people should start sending me dessert items in
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.360]   order to review their products.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.320]   In fact, that's probably a bad idea, but, uh, he, he just kind of got my attention and
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.920]   I actually was, it was a great program.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.800]   So there you go.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.280]   No, no, look at it.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.760]   The proof was in the pudding.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.320]   Uh, well, it's putting exactly the way, but speaking of putting, if you have putting, um, okay.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:21.200]   Well, uh, I got a little device in the mail that, uh, really made me very, very happy.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.680]   Uh, it is a USB, uh, thumb drive.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.080]   You can see it right there.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.240]   Let's go late screen on it.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.720]   It looks like that's not it.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.520]   It is actually this little USB.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.320]   Oh, I have one of those too.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.760]   They are so cool.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.680]   It is the verbatim, tough and tiny, uh, USB, USB drive.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.520]   It is the size much smaller than a penny.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.880]   It is thin as anything.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:51.760]   And believe it or not, you just stick this right into your USB drive and you get two to eight gigabytes worth of storage.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:57.640]   Uh, and I love this because number one, eight gigabytes, that's a lot of storage.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.920]   You can do a lot of really useful things with eight gigabytes.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:10.280]   I remember when was came to the screen savers and had a two gigabyte USB thumb drive around in his neck and I thought, wow, was it's cool.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.720]   Eight gigabytes on my key chain.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.720]   It's a format for PC.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.440]   Alex, it's all got portable apps on it.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.640]   I'm sorry to disappoint you.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.920]   Oh, you just borrow mine.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.800]   But of course, you got, of course, you can reformat it as well.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.120]   Is there a portable apps for the Mac?
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:32.480]   Cause that's what I, what I put on there was, you know, key pass and Firefox and Thunderbird, all the, all the windows portable apps.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.560]   Can you do that on a Mac?
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:38.800]   Cause that's what this would be great for is like to bring your Mac, all your stuff around with you.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.680]   And for me, I'm going to put all my presentations and sample files on it.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:50.000]   So I just have no matter what happens, I can walk up and if my presentation isn't working, I can just, in my computer or isn't working with anything, I can just stick it in a computer.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.960]   You have everything you need.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:58.880]   Well, see, the, the really double cool thing about it is that it's so thin that what I've been doing with it, I just like literally I keep it in my wallet.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.120]   And so I always have a critical utilities and something.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.800]   I can back up a couple of files onto right in here.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.280]   And it's not terribly expensive either.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:19.480]   So there have been times when not with this drive, because I only had it for about a week, when I really want to give some, but someone like a gigabyte worth of stuff, like a, oh, here's some, some really cool videos.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.200]   Here's some music that I really want you to try out.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   And you know what, if you have something like this in your bag that probably cost you all of like $3 or in my case, I'm, I'm this close to just having a big, like brandy snifter full of these like free USB drives that I've gotten with press kits on them over the past year, just giving them.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.720]   You have a full size Snickers bar or two gigabytes of mass storage kids have would take whatever you want.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.200]   But I mean, it's good to have that a big, big pile of storage so that you can do those backups.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.480]   You can even again, sneaker net a file over to somebody in a pinch.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:58.640]   And again, I don't necessarily like to put flash drives on keychains, but I always have my wallet with me when I leave, you know, driver's license legality.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.360]   Also my, my, my radio shack battery of the month club card.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.760]   I never, never leave home without that.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.680]   And so it means I will always have a pile of data with me wherever I go.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:29.400]   And that's not only that, but I also have, I also keep my system keychain, a copy of it rather on there so that anytime I'm at selling else's computer for a sec, I can essentially just open up securely open up that keychain and attach it to the current system keychain, have all my passwords, have all my accounts accessible, like with just one or two keystrokes.
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.800]   And then when I disconnect that keychain and unplug the drive, all those passwords go away.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:40.720]   So it's a very, very easy way to have some love measure of portability that only takes up, you know, like half an ounce in your wallet.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.280]   I love it.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.520]   I got one too.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.480]   I wish there were portable apps for this on the max side that there are on the PC side.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.680]   That's what's, that's really cool on the PC.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.880]   You can put all of this stuff on here and just put it in and it's like you're carrying it around with you.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.600]   Well, with a lot of applications that probably would run right off.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.640]   You could run, I mean, a lot of the applications say, especially the ones that say like drag to your application folder, right?
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.720]   You can run those from anywhere.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.680]   You don't need to install them.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.720]   So you could, you could literally have a bunch of those, those little helper apps.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.800]   I'll have to try and see the Firefox because really would just be Firefox.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.480]   I could use Thunderbird for the email stand alone because then it's really cool.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.400]   Let me see what they're saying in the chat room.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.480]   Yeah, there is free smug.org/portableapps.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.000]   There you go.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.200]   Always 10 portable apps because right now I have to find a Windows machine to use this.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:26.560]   Right.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.440]   Good choice, Andy.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.960]   And there, we did it on the Giz with, I think there's 39 bucks or cheap for a gig.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.120]   There are eight gigabytes on Amazon is 2842.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:37.960]   We even cheaper.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:38.480]   Twenty eight.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:42.600]   I mean, two gigs, which is something you can give people is 13 bucks.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.360]   Wow.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.720]   Start now.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.640]   That's why they should be shipping software on these.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.640]   You want to save a packaging Apple?
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.440]   It's the new Apple packaging.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:53.960]   Pecanio.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.400]   Huge.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.560]   When you go into the Apple store, they give you something the size of a penny.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.400]   Oh, I mean, it's also it's also very convenient.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.840]   You know, if you want to if you really want to annoy people, you can say, Oh, you're like your Bible.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.200]   Well, here's your Bible.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.400]   I've now got your whole Bible at my nose.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.760]   That was attractive for your Bible.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.120]   For those of you who have got your Wikipedia, my news.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.480]   Richard Dawkins.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.200]   I've got everything Richard Dawkins ever wrote up my nose.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.000]   I'm like, when they say tough.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.480]   I'm really mean, tiny and tiny.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.360]   I'm sorry for those of you who were listening only in audio.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.200]   You missed a moment.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:34.400]   Andy Anaco is the editor.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:34.920]   Not editor.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.360]   He's the well, the guy in charge of the celestial waste.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.120]   I don't know what you do.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:38.880]   You do the whole thing.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.200]   Celestial waste your band with CWOB.com.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.360]   Thank God.

[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.080]   And also, of course, the non localized phenomenon.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.640]   Let's put it that way.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.480]   The tech guy at the Chicago Sun times.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.080]   And he joins us every week.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.840]   And it's always a pleasure, Andy.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.360]   You could you know, you could stick this entire
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.040]   erv of shows up your nose.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:58.960]   There you go.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.280]   I get your make pretty quickly up my nose.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.600]   Also here we have a show title finally.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:09.680]   We always get a show title by the end of the show.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.720]   News storage.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.840]   News storage from Andy Anaco.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.800]   Alex Lindsey is the guy in charge of the Pixel core at Pixel
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.400]   core.com, that great guild of multimedia artists.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.240]   Pixel core.tv, the website for their podcast.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.480]   You've got a bunch of new ones coming up.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.880]   Well, and also the big thing is either on Friday afternoon
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.600]   or on Monday, we're going to have some stuff about services.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.000]   And then we're going to do a lot of videos on Macbreak related
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.320]   to the new features of Snow Leopard.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.120]   But so will you do a series Mac breaks video series of snow
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:40.240]   leopard.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.000]   Yeah, and we're going to probably do them a lot closer
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.840]   together than once a week just because it's just coming out.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.320]   So we'll probably have a lot of them coming out over the
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.000]   next couple of weeks.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.560]   Excellent.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.000]   Excellent.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.400]   We invite you to join us for the live version of this show.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.640]   We do it on live.twit.tv every Tuesday at 2 p.m.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   Eastern 11 a.m.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.520]   Pacific 1800 UTC.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.800]   And then of course you can listen to the podcast anytime by
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.440]   just subscribing in the iTunes store.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.320]   But thank you for joining us now.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.280]   But I screwed it up again.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.760]   Back to work.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.120]   Right time is over.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:14.680]   Back to work.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.920]   There was nothing.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:39.260]   But the hope of a dream that burning your soul will incredibly breathe
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:47.960]   And now, the moon through the ground, are the dream that's the world
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:55.060]   In a class how we change all our lives
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.060]   We are our hope
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:02.460]   Leading away
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.460]   We are our hope
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.960]   (upbeat music)
