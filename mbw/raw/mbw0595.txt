[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.260]   Want to get away from the snow
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.060]   In Montreal. Yeah, are you at the junction of highway?

[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.220]   I
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:34.160]   Anyway, great to have you on from I'm or calm and the vector podcast. We also have Alex Lindsay in studio today from the pixel
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   Gour hello hello back from his
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.300]   Circum navigation of the Matterhorn we took a little yeah, if you go to my Facebook page, I I was up with Andy
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.300]   I've got some who's the founder of hazoo and he flies helicopters and so he was kind enough to
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.540]   Take me for a and this wasn't for work or any no no we're just having fun
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.820]   When we were just on around I was like well, we're up here
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.880]   We were talked about I was like do you think your phone will be able to work and he's like I think it will
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.040]   All right, you know wait you streamed it via your we streamed it. Yeah, we streamed it from Andy's cellphone
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.780]   He's got a local connection. So there you go. There's so
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.380]   When Lisa's thought she thought oh, I'm jealous. He's at Disneyland
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.340]   And then she realized well, it's actual the actual Matterhorn
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.380]   Holy cow there it is. That's it. That's what it looks like at Disneyland - oddly enough looks like that at Disneyland
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.820]   But it's you know, it's it's oddly enough. I've been to both and this one's a lot larger
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:36.500]   Yeti's and this is an R22 it is a tiny helicopter. So it's like you're in a bubble in the sky. So it was um
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.700]   It was it was pretty nifty and I was kind of surprised at how how good the the streaming quality was looks like Colleen was a big part of your stream
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.180]   Well, she just she it was the middle of the night
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.860]   So I mean Colleen is a tends to be working in the middle of the night
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.300]   So I think she just happened to see we were just going back and forth. I said you know, I was answering questions live
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.320]   Oh, that's so much from all. Yeah, that's so much from there wasn't that many people watching so so still cook about you being 20
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.580]   Start, but you really are yeah. Yeah, he said he's up in his helicopter
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.660]   Circumnevegating the Matterhorn. Oh, yeah, just to know an ordinary day
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.980]   Also with us Andy and I co in his new studio. Hello Andrew. Hello. I guess I gotta say that
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.980]   I saw those pictures on Instagram and
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.820]   10% I thought there was a chance that you had a gig like in the area and you're just getting
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.780]   Having such problem streaming that you're just looking around said if we could somehow put a Wi-Fi repeater on the top of that
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.260]   Right all of our problems
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.220]   Well part of it was we have tried you know, Ariel is actually Ariel streaming has been something that we played with a little bit and we we have not
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.500]   kicked it we haven't been able to figure it out on a jet so
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.580]   So the helicopter was actually dramatically easier lower altitude. We're only at 9 or 10,000 feet instead of 30, but
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.940]   But anyway, it's always excited. Yeah, that's my shot. Is this an iPhone 10? What are you shooting? That is an iPhone 10 nice
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.820]   Yep, and the streaks you see there I think are actually oh no those are those are those are clouds at first
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.220]   I thought there were reflections on the the no no, I think that's actually there's the there's some reflections. That's flying up the
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   Or flying up the the valley towards the Matterhorn
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.500]   Yeah, Zumat somebody says I got it. I got to tell you that's why we're flying air's are not that there's the question
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.820]   I don't have a response to that one yet, but yeah, so so last week the highlight was
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.940]   Renee's picture of himself with Tim Cook this week the the highlighted the Instagram picture of Alex over the Matterhorn
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.380]   You're really goading me to go really bring my a game for Instagram for next week
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.300]   It's got to be more than squirrells. It's got it's gotta be me and Beyonce or
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.980]   Actually suited up inside the neutral buoyancy tag
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.860]   Or I got six days to make more of it
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.460]   Okay, Andy we're waiting
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:03.060]   So let's debunk or maybe not so we've been talking about and I think debunking rumors that the iPhone 10
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.620]   Supply was weak
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.740]   The you know rumors from digit times and other supply chains kgi that apple was disappointed with the sales that
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.380]   now it's coming from
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:22.340]   The wall street journal apple to cut iphone 10 production in the face of weak demand they're quoting
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.860]   People familiar with the matter saying that instead of 40 million iphones apple plans to make
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.020]   20 million this quarter that's a 50 drop other people
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.860]   According to the wall street journal familiar with the iphone supplies chains that apple cut orders for components using the iphone 10 by 60
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.660]   Now thursday apple is going to tell us how many iphones they've sold yep
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.660]   They won't break it down by
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.180]   8s and 10s and 7s and I guess you could still buy a 6s is
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.900]   Do a s p math to do that Leo
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.940]   Is this credible?
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.020]   Renee it is so
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:10.020]   Anything is absolutely credible and I prefer stories like this that have actual reporters names on them and sourcing and things because all too often
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.300]   Even the wall street journal even nbc will post up these
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:21.220]   Unattributed unnamed really bizarre apple has increased decreased this supplier apple has cut increased orders
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.260]   And that always smells to me of stock manipulation and you know
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:32.100]   I don't think media should ever be a tool of financial analysts or wall wars three people aiming to cover their shorts or their buys or anything like that
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.660]   Um, but also we see these stories so
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.620]   Freakin every year at this time
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.700]   And once in a while they're true and most often they're not and then we see a story saying that apple didn't really do this or apple
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:50.500]   Actually cut orders at this supplier but brought on this other supplier and in ear past him cook as cautions strongly caution investors
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:58.740]   That they shouldn't follow these things too closely because what apple does with any one supplier or any one set of orders is generally not reflective
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.380]   Of what they're doing with the overall business and one of the important things to me is that like these are all cool and interesting stories and people flock to them
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.420]   But there's a lot of people who either lose or make a lot of money based on these stories
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.660]   And we don't we should say upfront. This is not a show for investors. This is my show by analysts
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.940]   This is and frankly, I don't judge technology by how well it sells or how poorly it sells
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:28.900]   Um, you know when I said the i apple watch was a flop people said but leo it's selling like crazy and I said that but i'm not talking about it flop
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:36.420]   Financially i'm talking about it as a technical product and by the way i've revised my opinion the series three has completely turned that around from my point of view
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.460]   However, that's the point is we're talking about
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:45.060]   End users buying products and whether this product is worth buying so the only thing that would be
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.900]   You know relevant about this story. It's not a financial story for us is
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.580]   Is there something wrong with the iphone 10 that consumers are rejecting and the first thing you'd look at is cost
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.020]   It is and the other models because apple put out three flights
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.180]   Ever apple's had all of these models for sale at the same time
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.420]   And I think you could also perhaps point to face id
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.540]   And I I hear this from a lot of people saying uh, I I like touch id i'm not
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.980]   Convinced in face id and even people who have iphone 10 aren't you know are saying yeah?
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.020]   Maybe it's not as good as face id and then third and final factor might be the size of the screen
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.820]   Which is slightly smaller than a plus sized
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.580]   Uh, and so you're sacrificing a little screen real estate because of the bars at the top it's kind of narrow too
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:37.060]   What's what i'm hearing from a lot of people is that it was just hard to differentiate between what they're getting with the iphone 10
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.260]   And what they're getting with the iphone 8 and then you realize that these are people who are considering upgrading from an
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.620]   iPhone 7
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:49.700]   Uh, and it's I think that in retrospect it might have been more interesting if they went for
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:57.300]   Really the here's the ceramic case here is the here is the solid 18 karat gold case that it comes in
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.900]   Not this that's ridiculous, but the idea of where here's what you're getting here is something really distinctive
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.740]   You're getting for the extra thousand dollars that doesn't require a technology demo
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:12.100]   Doesn't require thousands and thousands of words of columns explaining how face id
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.180]   Works here is something where hold one in your hand hold the other one in your hand
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.900]   If you have if you had the capability of spending a thousand dollars for
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.140]   Again the version of this phone with the amf m radio no air conditioning
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:31.140]   Would you get that that would lead you to get that instead of even spending a thousand dollars for the iphone 8
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.340]   But with all the bells and whistles on it. I just think that is as impressive as uh as the iphone 10 is
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.460]   I just don't think they managed to create a package that
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.540]   Appeal to those people in the way that it needed to to get that extra couple hundred bucks
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.820]   It's interesting to see that we make we sometimes say that oh well apple people are there there
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.900]   That's where all the money is those the people who are the really really exclusive
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.980]   budgeted
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.500]   Buyers but it turns out they're just as sensitive to price as anybody else
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.180]   It's not they may have a thousand dollars to spend but they're not going to throw away
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.220]   $200 on a phone if they don't know what they're going to get for it
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.020]   I have to say I
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.460]   Purely industrial design. I think it's beautiful. Yeah, I like the stainless steel. Yeah the
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:20.340]   Edge I think it's a gorgeous phone. I'm very happy with the only but I'm less price sensitive than the average bear
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.740]   Because I got to buy it no matter what and I think for me the only things that I find difficult are
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.740]   Sometimes quitting apps that don't want to like now you don't have that hardware like I'm gonna
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.260]   Like it knew I like the new UI though. Oh no, I like the eye. I don't really like swiping up
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.620]   I like swiping but there are times there are some apps that don't properly support it
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.340]   Don't give you an art, you know something to grab onto and it becomes like this
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.700]   I'm getting out of them and the second one is like taking if you want to take picture
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.700]   I take a lot of pictures of
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.180]   And it seems like this like hit in this thing about when I hit the two buttons whether it's actually going to take a picture
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.020]   Or it's going to go to sleep. There are a few yeah and there are a few issues with the yeah
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:59.220]   So there's a mechanical switches that but other than that it's definitely I mean obviously the best phone I've ever had
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.340]   I mean, it's it I think the pictures are great the it's kind of a fetish object for me. Yeah, it's
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.980]   I mean honestly, it's it's it's a it's more emotional
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.900]   than technical it's more and actually I do like the UI I feel like that's a good UI going
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.980]   Overall I love the UI it's just a couple little yeah, but you're right and that's you can't play map over that
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.420]   That's really apps not yeah, probably not taking it
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:28.260]   You see still to this day I'll get app updates to say now works with the iPhone 10 and I said oh it didn't work before
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.980]   I was confusing sometimes like google maps when you swipe up
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.180]   It doesn't take you home it intercepts that and brings up the information box
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.100]   And then people don't realize you have to swipe up again to get back to home. They just think it's broken
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.180]   Yeah, so it's it's hard to like they have their own paradigms and sometimes they collide with apples
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:48.900]   So because this is by line by yuko kaboda in Beijing and trip mikle in san francisco because it's the wall street journal
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:55.940]   Uh, we're gonna give this some credence right. I mean, uh, yeah now how much of is is that apple orders a bunch of stuff up front
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:02.660]   And doesn't you know it doesn't it usually drop the number of I think that one thing that bonus it buys in the second quarter
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.900]   I think that I think that what apple is incredibly good at is managing their supply chain
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.740]   Right, so so they're gonna tell everybody make as much as you possibly can
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.660]   We're gonna we're gonna have all the fields in there and then and then what you're gonna want to do
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:21.060]   Is you're gonna want to like immediately stop that if you as soon as you know that you can coast for this net number of months
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.300]   On what on what they're producing you definitely want everybody ramping to a hundred percent
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.780]   I hope this means that like starting next month or maybe by the late spring
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.380]   Like if you go to ada fruit, they'll suddenly have an influx of like 3d
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.700]   mobile cameras
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.820]   With with with certain logos scraped off of them at a really good price
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.300]   Yeah, we actually know that that that in fact does happen. I talked to somebody who makes
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.780]   Uh a sensor in here
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.940]   Uh, that's very important for the face ID and they're making 50 more now
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:56.020]   Than apple's buying because they're because they because they've created a demand. They've got the price down. They've got the production
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.820]   Uh yields up and and now there's a demand and there's and there's now seasons and when you can buy some of these chips that that you can't buy them
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820]   It's when I was talking to a manufacturer who had
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:12.260]   Three three little components in there in their hardware and they literally had to wait until the iPhone run before they were able to
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.100]   Build their product. Yeah. Yeah
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.140]   Now that's as sophisticated and as expensive as these companies get
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.980]   We don't realize you sometimes forget that this is a factory that has a capability that is booked well in advance
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.740]   And they have scheduled three and a half months as though it's a Broadway theater
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.060]   Okay, great three and a half three and a half years in advance
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.380]   You have booked this theater for three and a half months
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.020]   But after three and we will be manufacturing other things before that and other things after that
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:44.820]   So if you have if you may you may lose the ability to get this kind of a screw or this kind of a lens
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.340]   Or this kind of an assembly out of this factory after this date
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.580]   So why not hedge your bets and make sure you have
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.420]   More components because if you don't if you're not going to use them in manufacturing
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.700]   You can just put them in the repair chain. You'll you'll use them somewhere, right?
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.020]   But remember the IPS panels where they were so expensive and then apple just put them in every iMac
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.020]   And they put them in every led display and then after that everyone started being able to afford
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.580]   Um, IPS panels and it just it does that because it could order so many of the same thing
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.380]   At one time that really ramps up the production for everybody
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:19.620]   Do you remember the the eight the helipacard was the playbook or the uh, oh god bookpad or whatever?
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.940]   I forget what it was called, but I was trying to figure out what to do with mine because
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:30.740]   Yeah, something like that, but it was like there one that one of those wave of waves as soon as everybody got slate
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.100]   Uh, the slate. Yeah, the the first wave of tablets after the ipad came out
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.540]   Uh, and I was looking at what to do with it because obviously
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.220]   This is the mark of failure that I note in a manufacturer when it's like, okay
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.220]   Well, uh, my loan period for this thing is up
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   Uh, do you do you want it back and then they do a calculation where it'll cost them $24 to ship it back that we don't want it back
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.580]   Just keep that yeah, you always know that's that is a sign
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.420]   But it was but it was a funny thing
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.540]   So I was looking for something to do with it because now i'm going through all the stuff that I have
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:07.060]   Uh, and I discovered that it was using almost the exact right I think actually the exact same ips panel
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.540]   Uh, as was in the original ipad
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.780]   Uh, I know that because you can pop it out and buy on ebay like a $30
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:19.140]   Uh board that will turn that will use use this component and give it an hdmi port and all this other cool stuff
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.580]   So you can actually make some use out of it
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:28.500]   But I was surprised that enough of these components were floating around that hp could make at least 10 000 of these things based on that same
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   Panel technology
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.500]   so do uh
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.420]   Do we think that maybe the fact that rumor says
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.380]   Pretty good rumor from people like mark german
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.460]   There'll be two new iphone 10 style iphones one less expensive lcd based one larger
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.140]   Oled based in the fall did that does that have something to do with the calculus people are making
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.500]   And i'll stick with my i like if I had an iphone 7 I might say yeah, that's fine
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.140]   I'm gonna wait till this fall and i'll get the bigger iphone 10
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:06.500]   Maybe I think a thousand a thousand bucks is a really big deal. It's the price. I really I really think that was it
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.300]   Yeah, I think I think that all these features are going to be hugely successful once they migrate down into the usual
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   Uh 650 to 859 hundred dollar iphones even the 900 dollar one I think will be I think more people can tell themselves
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.380]   Well, i'm gonna spend an extra 100 200 bucks. This is gonna be my big splash
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.700]   Once you're once you once you self identify as someone who is willing to spend a thousand dollars or more on a phone
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.460]   It's sort of like the hump you have to get over the when you get your first tattoo
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.060]   Now once I do this, I will be someone who has gotten a tattoo
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:43.060]   For good or for bed. I'll have to redefine myself as someone who's willing to spend that much money on a base model
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.340]   I'm still i'm still curious because every time there's a launch I go to is
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.060]   I usually go to one of the big flagship stores for launch
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.060]   And then I go to a bunch of local stores and I ask the people buying it and I get is it expensive
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.700]   And resoundingly this time the answer I got was it's a thousand dollars. I don't know
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.420]   It was $28 for the last one is $32 a month for this one. I figured what the hell it's $4
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:08.420]   And I still think that even though there's no contracts they have gone to great lens and they i mean apple and the carriers and every phone vendor
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.140]   Has gone to great lens to make the price the actual price of the product as invisible as possible
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.380]   Uh to buy her so for them it really just as a matter of how much is my leasing agreement
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.540]   And they don't even think about it as a leasing agreement anymore
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.580]   It's like how much is my whatever i'm paying t mobile bill every month and if it's three or four dollars one way or another
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.260]   $5 when we know that they don't seem they don't seem that pressured by it anymore
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.620]   I'm from wonderfelcer. They're if if apple had a let's say a one week return policy instead of a two week return policy
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.340]   If it gave you if you had or or let's say a month long return policy
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:46.340]   I think a lot of what bit a lot of people was the differences and how you use this phone versus what they were familiar with for the past
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.940]   uh 10 years on their existing iphone with a physical clicky home button
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.780]   uh and
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.020]   They see that two weeks staring that they're they now they now have 48 hours left to decide
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.180]   Am I going to get used to this in the next two weeks or is it time for me to bail
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.740]   Uh and go back to my old phone or split or down grade to do an iPhone 8
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:10.980]   It's it's a huge jump. I mean I I have I have I have the seven is what I take international because it's got t mobile and then and then my
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.460]   AT&T or whatever's on my 10
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.700]   And going back and forth constantly is almost as hard as going back and forth to android
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.500]   Yeah, you know, it's like it's where you're just like what is it doing now? You know, so it's the control center
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.980]   I get confused every time to be fair and balanced. We should also mention apple insider kind of did a little deeper dig on these claims and
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.380]   And basically says this is
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.740]   The journal got it wrong. They've talked to a lot of people who say that supply
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.980]   The orders are up that supply is up more people
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.740]   more
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.340]   in other words
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.420]   It doesn't seem like there is
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.780]   It's a cut so we just we just don't know
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.860]   I mean, that's every year it does have an every year. Seriously. It is every year. Yeah
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:20:00.820]   Um, is it not true every year or is it this is just business as usual? What is the thing is that like the
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.220]   Wall Street Journal, Nikke
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.540]   CNBC they have all gotten it wrong
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.860]   They've gotten it right sometimes too, but they've gotten it wrong often enough that you can't just depend on them
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.540]   Because that's the name on the publication and some of those reporters
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:18.980]   Just based on what we know about apple have gotten it's so wrong so often that you can't depend on it based on the reporter name either
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.220]   So we like the only thing I can suggest that people is and actually someone on twitter apply this to me
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.500]   Goes I'm a stock trader and legitimately this stock should only move when the reportings are reported
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.740]   Or events are held in new products are disclosed, but walnut doesn't make any money that way
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.060]   So every other day is a battle for room respectuation and you end in order to move the stock and make money
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:44.660]   And I could be wrong, but I believe that the iPhone 10 was still the best selling phone on the christmas season
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.380]   at the price point that it was
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.860]   I believe that that was the
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.700]   Yeah
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:58.020]   So also if they if they sold 20 million phones for heaven's sakes that's a that's a success on almost any balance sheet
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.580]   29 million phones according to canalis
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.420]   Of course, that's not a number from apple. That's its estimate
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:10.580]   In q4 2017 calendar fourth quarter 2017 29 million units
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.180]   So there are 29 million people willing to pay
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:21.220]   Thousand more or most of the other other companies are other than samslung no one seeing those kind of numbers right?
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.620]   Yeah, and it'll be just the numbers this year
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.780]   But also the guidance they give next next quarter that i'll be really telling because they guide sharply down
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.700]   And we'll know that the product is trending down
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.060]   So usually apple does its results on tuesday and rene has to run out the door early, but you get a little break
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.420]   Thursday
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:42.020]   Yeah, we'll get we'll get the actual numbers at least some numbers from apple and some and people like niel sibert
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.180]   Are really good at breaking down what what the asp is and what that means for the mix
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.540]   What's asp stand for the average selling price so you can determine because there's a range of iPhones
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.740]   Depending on what the average selling price is if the average selling price is high
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.820]   It's an indicator that there's some more expensive iPhones that are selling if the average selling price is low
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.460]   It's an indicator that the less expensive ones were selling and it can change like previously
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.300]   Asp for ipads was low because there were so many ipad minis
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.340]   But then that bit many sort of fell out of favor and with the ipad pro came out
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.740]   It went up and we saw with iphone 7 that apple had unusually strong demand for the plus model
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.860]   Which is more expensive so it went up and very very rarely tim cook will answer that if there's like a really good answer
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.420]   Like you'll say iphone 7 plus had exceedingly strong demand strongly anticipated demand
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.460]   Most often he won't but people are really good at sort of taking that asp
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.220]   Running the math and figuring out okay
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.100]   There's only seven or eight possibility possible ways to get to this number and these are the more likely ones
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.660]   So we think the mix is you know, it's is like this
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.980]   So the home pod ordering began on friday immediately ordered a space gray model
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:48.980]   Looks like you can still get it in fact you could still get it delivered on february 9th
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.180]   That means they're not selling out
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.060]   It's all three countries
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.780]   Yeah, and it's and it's also the first edition of something
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:03.060]   Where apple really gets going is when you get someone who's who loves their iphone
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.460]   They want the next one. They love their ipad. They want the next one
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.020]   Right now, it's just a speaker
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:12.580]   And it's not like this was november where people are going to say hey, what the hell it's
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.540]   I'm already $5,000 in debt for christmas shopping
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.820]   Let's what's 349 more or i'm going to buy for someone who doesn't know what it is right now
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:28.100]   And i'm sure that that this really is something where the first week of reviews is going to be very very telling about how people
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:34.340]   I want I want to actually see how the waitlist shapes up after the first wave of reviews
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:41.460]   It's a it's a device that i've been reading thanks to thanks to uh, rene and uh, and and uh serenity
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.940]   You know the other people who've had a chance to actually listen to it
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.300]   It's really hitting me that this is not a device to me
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.020]   Excuse me that really impresses when you look at the specs when you look at a table of what it can do
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:57.940]   This is something where you have to listen to it before you decide whether it's good for you or not
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.900]   And that's going to be something that's going to be it's going to require a lot of youtube videos are saying of people
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   You know with their caps like this
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:13.060]   Dude, I can't believe the sound out of this. I'm just i'm just throwing away my time window speakers because it's so awesome
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.020]   Oh, then any bends in a home pod
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:23.060]   One thing to remember about the about the the quantity the supply of home pods is that apple was expecting to launch this back
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.660]   Uh last year and the hardware didn't change
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.700]   And they were expecting to ramp up to more countries so they've had extra months to just produce these things
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.500]   So the supply likely far exceeds what apple would have had at hand if they launched this last year
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.220]   And they're only launching in three countries now which may not make a significant dent in the supply they had for
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.220]   What should have been a bigger rollout by now are they launching prematurely?
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:52.500]   Even to even this launch because uh airplay 2 is not ready. There no stereo pairing. There's no multi room sound
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.820]   It feels like it's it's still and that may also be suppressing sales
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.180]   People might be waiting until to see when they do add those features. I think apple didn't do a really good like
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:08.660]   Based on the amount and repetitiveness of the questions that i've been getting like nobody seems to know how it works with an apple tv
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.660]   Nobody seems to know how how does it work with an apple tv?
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:20.100]   So is it related to the apple tv somehow it will do apple music and iCloud music library natively
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.900]   So anything that you've put on apple music or iTunes match will just play and you'll have full silly control
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   Everything else is airplay so you in apple tv you can choose it as an airplay target
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:36.260]   And say play through the home pod on your iphone you can say i have spotify play spotify over airplay to to the
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.820]   Home pod you can do all those things and it'll just ingest that do its computational
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.380]   Audio magic and just fill the room with this 3d sound that it's really really good at
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:52.340]   Um, and if people who say that apple doesn't know speakers have really not paid attention to what's happening with iphone and ipad speakers lately
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.420]   Because apple has significantly
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:00.260]   Up their speaker game recently and it i am the i'm the i'm the austrettany got a chance to listen to it against google home
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:06.500]   And so knows one and there was a great reddit thread the radio the reddit audio file for um one of their contributors
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.820]   Got a chance to listen to it and it is just
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:14.180]   Even me terrible listening i have so knows i love so knows so knows always sounded great to me
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.860]   Then i heard the air pod i'm like oh i've been listening to muddy audio for years
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:23.940]   Interest well i will uh we're gonna i mine comes february 9th what we'll do on february 10th and new screen savers
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.060]   Will have a sonos one will have a google home max
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:32.020]   We'll have the air pod i'll bring in the sonos play five too. We actually have plenty here
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.900]   I don't have to bring it in but i'll bring in the expensive sonos and we'll do a listening test
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:41.300]   I think that's a good idea. We'll just get a bunch of people not just me but a bunch of people and say
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:47.700]   Well, we'll have them face that way and play the same song through all four try to get the volumes the same
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.300]   And see well that's the best way to do that right i think i think i think then you get them all talking to each other and you can have this
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   Week in intelligent assistance
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:01.620]   Well, syria is quite limited because of the leo have them move around the room because that's one of the cool things too because
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.340]   You want you want them to see how it sounds all through the different areas of the room
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.180]   Now they mentioned beamforming they've got those seven tweeters along the bottom
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.460]   All the way around so that it could aim in any direction
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.180]   But is it i understand that it'll sense what it's getting because it has microphones too
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.620]   From its position in the room, but is it smart enough to aim at it? I mean if you move around is it going to change for you?
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.620]   It it should understand the room. I don't think it changes
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.380]   You because it doesn't know where you are no well it can probably
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.340]   It understands reflections and echoes and things like that
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.140]   But it really wants to fill the room with a 3d environment
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.660]   So if it's close to a wall it'll bounce off that wall if it's in the middle of the room
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.020]   It'll project out through the room it'll modulate based on its position
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.420]   But it really wants you as you move through the room to get a good sound and to have almost no
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.100]   Dead spots like I couldn't find one down down on the line moved all around trying to find
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   A terrible room for audio. So this will be the greatest place to do it
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.260]   We'll get a bunch of people will put blindfolds on them jerry make notes
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.260]   This is what we're going to be doing in a week
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.020]   And we'll put blindfolds on them. We'll have them face away from the speakers
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.540]   We'll play all five speakers. We'll have them wander the room
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.380]   Looking for dead spots and if there is a room with dead spots, it's this room
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:16.260]   There are plenty of things that I should point out is that people got super angry when people who heard the home
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.420]   Pod said that it sounded really good compared to their speakers
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:25.220]   But in general those other things aren't primarily speakers if you've got like a thousand dollar pair of speakers or really like that's what I want to hear
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.380]   We could do that we could get some bnos in here
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.300]   Like the most on echo is like a hundred dollar
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.580]   Commodity speaker of course a three hundred fifty dollar speaker is going to sound but that's that's that's not like rocket science
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.420]   I want to hear like apples aspirations that this is the next generation of audio
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.900]   It sounds way better than a three hundred fifty dollar speaker
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:46.500]   So I want to hear it compared to like people who are really good at audio putting it up against a thousand dollars
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.020]   Terri-O system of fifteen hundred dollar stereo system to see really how
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:59.460]   There's no way it's going to get speaker that's you know, I'm I'm more fascinated by what someone who is not an expert is going to react to this
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.340]   I think that this is a such an interesting example of
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.780]   Making it I think that oftentimes especially with stereos
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.740]   You ever taken a walk down memory lane and taken look at like stereo ads from the 70s and 80s
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.020]   And it's all like graphs and specter grams and yep
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:20.420]   Because the way you sell these things is you make sure people know how good this graph is and how good this table is
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:27.860]   And you put on the and you put on the front plate all of the dobe ax one four four one point eight not point four seven
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.340]   And that's inscribed right into the thing you try to convince somebody that in the in a
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:38.020]   $1000 listening room, which you certainly do not have as a as a reader of popular mechanics
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.340]   This is the best sounding one. It's really going to be great to hear
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.900]   I'm just going to take this 350 dollar thing
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.740]   Which is something that most people who are interested in better sound can afford
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:55.620]   Plop it in the middle of whatever room people hang out with the list of music in and see how good it sounds in that space and
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.700]   It's I'm going to be interested
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.500]   I will be interested in the first person who has access to one of those
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.980]   $1000 listening rooms. I was actually in preparation
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:11.380]   I was actually looking at youtube videos of super high and like stereo setups and they're incredible
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.540]   But that's going to be interesting
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:20.260]   But I want to see what the what people's reaction is when they've been going from whatever five six seven year olds
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:26.900]   Stereo system. They've spent maybe a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars for what happens when you put this cassava melon size thing
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.020]   Just wherever it is the most convenient place for it to go and then see and then see how it works
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.900]   That says as as rade and other people have been saying
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.900]   If it's not necessarily the greatest speaker system in the world
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:44.420]   But it's the greatest at making the best use of whatever random room you're in and again
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.620]   I I moved to a building that was built in 1911 and used to be a high school
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:54.900]   You will not you will you cannot believe the contours of this office. I'm in right now
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:02.420]   This is not an ideal listening spot. It's almost a waste of money to buy a $10,000 stereo system because it just bounces off in so many directions
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:08.020]   That's why my listening test spot is going to be yes in the living room where I have the good stereo
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:15.220]   But definitely in here. I think that if if the apple device can really shine here boy apple has got something
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:22.100]   I've been looking for a reason to buy one of these deviolay phantoms the three thousand or two thousand dollar
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   Speaker, you know the french
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.700]   Yeah, these are single speakers. I'd be very
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.420]   I have two words for you. What do it?
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:36.100]   Because that's okay. I mean honestly if you're gonna compare apples to apples
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:43.380]   Not by price but by you know, this is a single speaker you can do this pairing of course and all that stuff that
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.780]   Audio files are raving over this
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.420]   This is to me is like the ultimate in great way to get one with the titanium tweeter
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.820]   But that's only $3,000. I know I know you think titanium is a better tweeter
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.580]   I think it must be and they they made it sound like a hamster
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.780]   Because I think if you really wanted to test this you would want to
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.820]   Test it against the deviolay. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.140]   um
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.140]   Go for it
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.340]   I can't really can't justify it. It's like should I jump off that clip? Yeah
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.140]   You guys aren't really
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:20.740]   Skye, but alliter's in the room. So I would I would say though if you hired enough good audio engineer
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.260]   I mean really good audio engineers
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.300]   And you said to them your task is to take this really
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:30.820]   Any audio engineer I'll tell you it's because it's too small to give really deep bass and good sound
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.220]   And we want to give you computer modeling algorithms
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.260]   Right we want to give you the ability to sweeten it
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:43.300]   Well, and I think to make it sound better. I think that we have a really fully explored that realm
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.540]   I think that software could make computation exactly computational audio is going to be something
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.020]   Fotography exactly. This is the beginning
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.100]   But I and I don't think it's the end but but I do think you know and I've had in my day
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.980]   Some pretty nice speakers in the house, but I had to build the room for it because otherwise it wasn't worth having them
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.700]   You know and so you can get now things like odyssey that tune the speakers
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.860]   Yeah, I'm totally and I do that with my home theater whenever the question is is that going to be available for 300 bucks?
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.980]   You know, that's the the big thing is no actually sonos
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.460]   I don't know how good it is, but they have
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:21.140]   A technology built into sonos speakers that tune the speakers will be interesting to see if they're comparable to
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   What we're seeing here. I mean, I think that's the way I wish I had the money to buy this
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.780]   File on reddit that sonos one was about 80 percent of home pot to him
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:35.940]   See and I don't think the sonos one sounds particularly good. It's okay for a speaker of that size, but it's not impressive
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.900]   There's a lot of people there's I think the difference is the how uh phone cameras
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.820]   As of two or three years ago really kick the butt of traditional cameras. There's such a thing is good enough
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:53.780]   Honestly, there are people that I want to I want to be I want this affordable device with one button that I press the button
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.460]   And it takes a really good picture
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.900]   It's okay if you photo wonks like and you not go can zoom in and say oh, but look at the noise in the shadow
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.060]   Oh, look at the purple banding in this highlight that it's it works great for me
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.620]   It's it's the best pictures I've ever taken and it just I take it out of my pocket. I press a button it works
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.220]   I think that's what we're gonna be seeing with with speakers right now might actually
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:19.460]   Can I can I ask a question of when later on can I guess a question of Renee? I'm quite I'm interested in what happens when
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.740]   I'll I'm sorry interrupt. I will ask it later if I have time there's a question that I've have not seen anywhere that
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:31.380]   I'm not going to respond to that from official sources yet. Well now that Andy has teased us. I'm going to pause for a station
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:38.740]   Perfect. Oh, so not go is such a pro what a pro I have no idea what he's talking about coming up after the after the first
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.500]   You want to know what this wonderful question is it feels like you couldn't really just buy one of these
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.700]   You should buy two of them. I think you buy six. Oh, you can
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.820]   I can't buy one so
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:56.420]   Yeah, this is the gold phantom with the titanium tweeter. Oh, yeah, it's the stupidest looking speaker
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.940]   You sure there's not a spaceship. It looks like a spaceship. It's just it's very french
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.620]   It looks like it looks like the first suppository speaker
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.820]   It's a little bigger than that
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:12.660]   You're talking about playing the music out of your ago 14 Hertz to 27 kilohertz. That's more than your ear
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.380]   I said more leo I said more
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:23.300]   Should I should your cats will love it. I should just remember when you when you look at when you look at it that
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.380]   Evian spelled backwards is naive
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:31.380]   Well, there is if oh god see I shouldn't be looking at sites like this
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.780]   This is like then then you have to buy their receiver or whatever this is of course
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:41.140]   And then and why you know don't you know they show you the little one
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   I know but really the one you want
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.300]   Yeah, it's the big one
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.860]   2000 watts at six ohms
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:53.940]   And here they are at the pelle gagne looks like there's a hundred of them
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.820]   Let's do some math. That's five ten
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.700]   There's 19 daviettes
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.300]   $38,000 worth of weirdo good bluetooth
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:12.660]   There's a good review. We will we will we will watch on youtube of the devielle
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:19.780]   You know who I do know one person who owns one leuik lemur. Oh, there you go. He would be the kind of he would be the guy that would own him
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.340]   He's french. He's uh rich
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:29.060]   He's insanely well. He's insanely wealthy and uh and he's uh and he likes good music
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.220]   Wow
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.180]   So it's that or the home pod. I think the home pod is going my
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.780]   My mind
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.220]   Well, dude, but I see if I could find a devielle just for the review
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:44.660]   If you're listening that would be kind of fun, you know why because if if the blind tester said
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.380]   Yeah, it's good, but I like the home pod better
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.580]   It's the same guy who lends the bugatti got chiron to top gear would lend leo the speaker
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.380]   Yes, we just come on over maybe get low eek to bring his up
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.620]   Our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage. I will need a rocket mortgage to buy the devielle
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.100]   You can
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.100]   If you're buying a new house
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.500]   If you're not, you know, leuik you're probably not writing a check you're getting a mortgage
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:16.020]   This by the way, maybe the last time to get a great home loan rate at a refi because the rates of
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.500]   Aren't they just went up three times? I think in the last few weeks
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:24.180]   Now's the time to buy to refi with rocket mortgage rocket mortgage comes from quick and loans the best
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.500]   Home lender in the business number one in customer satisfaction eight years running now
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:35.300]   According to jd power number one in the u.s. They also I mean they're a cool company. They're very technologically literate
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.380]   uh, dan kilbert and his crew, uh, you know, no the geeks
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.380]   If there's if there's anything you know about geeks, they don't want to go to a bank
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:49.300]   To apply for a home loan and if and that and the after that this next worst thing is going into the attic of the basement
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:54.500]   To go through papers to find your bank statements from four years ago or your pay stubs from
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.260]   Your last job or any of that stuff. We don't want to do that. We want to do it all
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.460]   On our phones and that's what rocket mortgage is all about. You can do it all online

[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.180]   You could literally do this on your phone without going to get some paperwork
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.140]   You can answer all the questions they need to know the basics
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.460]   Because they have trusted partners in all the financial institutions
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.780]   They can get all the other information they need based on your income assets and credit
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.580]   They crunch the numbers. They offer you the loans for which you qualify great rates. You choose the rate
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.380]   You choose the term you choose the down payment and then you're mortgage with confidence. That's how it works
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.460]   It's easy rocket mortgage

[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.380]   Um
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.580]   There are some interesting other stories in the news
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.420]   Mark german uncharacteristically buried the lead
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.220]   in his story
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.540]   He was talking about
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.180]   The brilliant
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.500]   Work that apple's doing with custom silicon
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:38.260]   And by the way a great article to read just because of that right
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:45.460]   Um, let me see if I can find it because it's kind of funny. There it is how apple built a chip powerhouse
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.660]   To threaten qualcom and intel scroll down a little bit to karstin because it's just
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.100]   This is on bloomberg technology. There's some great graphs
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.980]   Is there a good way to refix listen to these
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:02.420]   Yeah, I know what you mean who has time to read, but I I make time I have to I read I read the whole thing
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.260]   I was just yeah, but the graphics are important on this because it shows you
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.260]   You know what silicon it's actually there's a really nice timeline
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:16.820]   Uh, which I like that gives you an idea of when the you know the various chips came out
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.940]   the a starting with the a4 their first system on a chip back in 2010
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.980]   Then moving through to a 11
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:32.180]   Uh or 2011 with the a5 5x 6 of course we're currently up to the a11 bionic in the iphone 10
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:38.340]   Uh the a10x fusion with the motion co processors which started in uh
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.140]   2013
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.300]   And now we've got those new w1 and w2 bluetooth chips
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:52.420]   That are empowering the uh both the airpods and the apple watch and of course the t1 and t2
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.220]   Chips that are in the new mac books
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:00.980]   Uh the t1 mac co processor and the t2 which is in the iMac pro
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.100]   But what's funny?
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.020]   Is he buries
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   Deep within the story
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.460]   This line
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.820]   The new ipad do to be released toward the end of the year
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.060]   what
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.340]   Wait a minute what oh, oh, hold on wait a minute this
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.980]   We'll probably also include the apple design graphics engine in ai chip
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.060]   Am I was I missing something did?
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.700]   Renee had you heard about the new ipad do to be released toward the end of the year
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:37.380]   12 to 18 months. So it's like new iphone coming in September. It just depends on which event they have it ready for
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.620]   Okay, I mean yeah, usually they come out in october right after the new iphone, but okay
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.940]   If he said it was gonna be a triangle then my draw would drop
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:50.100]   That yeah, so but so but I feel like he kind of kind of has a timeline in his head and then
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:55.140]   Next paragraph so far only two mac lines include custom apple processors as we mentioned
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.540]   That macbook pro with touch bar and the iMac pro apple is working
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:05.300]   He says on at least three updated mac models with custom co processors for release as soon as this year
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.700]   Including updated laptops and a new desktop
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.100]   That's the new mac pro that's got to be the mac pro as soon as this year
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:18.980]   But I I I mean I guess so you're saying this is all just presumption based on history
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.660]   Yeah, I think if he thought this was scooper that he would have spun out an article with with that as a
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:28.020]   So he doesn't have a source saying that this is he really does but he like those those are sort of routine expected
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.540]   um
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.580]   Updates and if it was something like you know mark is really really good at finding the thing that's super interesting about a story
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.340]   delivering the goods. Yeah. Yeah, I think he buried the lead
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.820]   But I think he's too good
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.340]   I think that
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:50.180]   I think he put that piece of information where he thought it merited being placed. He's he's a really good professional
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.140]   So I I wouldn't I don't need make a mistake like that. Okay
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:58.580]   But for those of us who are normals as interesting as this custom silica is
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:05.540]   Uh, I've been thinking when should I should I you know, I love my 10.5 inch ipad pro
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:11.220]   But I wouldn't mind seeing something that had the iphone 10 ui and face id and
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:18.580]   I find myself so less pressured about the ipads as far as upgrading because it's just they I think a lot of people don't push them that
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.100]   Hard so you feel like it's just saying but there's people out there saying should I get it an ipad pro
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.580]   Or should I wait and now you have something a little bit more concrete to wait for
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.980]   Yeah, I just always tell them at least I always tell them wait
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.900]   Absolutely as long as you can look at when up or at least the last model and you know
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.500]   Feel out that timeline because they release new ipads about every 18 months
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.820]   You know check that timeline and then if you can't wait any longer buy what you buy what you have
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:49.620]   And be happy with it because there'll always be something new. I also um, I'm hoping that apple will do new mac books
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:55.940]   Uh, you know because I love the macbook. I guess I can the hope that will abandon the butterfly keys
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:02.660]   That's a big question. I mean the new mac books most years and new macbooks follow intel's chip line and it's not just when intel
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.900]   Yeah, not this year maybe
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:10.820]   But it's when they have the specific chips that apple uses are available and sometimes that takes a lot longer than the initial announcement of that chip
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.820]   This would be a good time to abandon
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:18.100]   The intel platform and look at something else if you ask for a high level performance
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.940]   Like I mean we're stuck with those designs and intel is already done cannon lake and and what is a coffee lake and those things were already
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.380]   You know done so it's going to take a while to get past that
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.460]   I think if we see the move to arm chips
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.220]   It'll and arm chips were affected by this too
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.780]   But if we see the move to arm chips, it'll be something like the the macbook line that gets it first
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.500]   They said only on the mac pro not this year meaning 2017
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.780]   And when should you think of the right they didn't say a year?
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:51.060]   I think they they hate to give dates because they know that you know, it's it's very hard to aim a year in the future and have that arrow land
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:56.100]   So it's easier just to say in the future than they could be reasonable think that it will be a new mac pro will be this year
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.020]   Yeah, I mean it's reasonable. We'll get a highlight of it
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:04.100]   We'll ship at a minute to midnight on
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.300]   Yeah, I don't I don't know about expecting a new mac pro to ship this year
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.860]   Be shocked if they didn't at least show it off
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.420]   at wwdc
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.620]   And I think we're 50/50 that after they show it off it will be
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:26.900]   Available for viewing on a rotating platform beneath three inches of carbon silicate that you cannot possibly get through
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.620]   It will be a long working month. It lays it until meltdown is fixed, but that's years
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.500]   That's not like a month. Exactly. Hey speaking of which until last week said pulled back
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:42.020]   It's firmware mitigation. Yes for specter saying oops
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:48.340]   Because the fixes were making some machines reboot spontaneously. They were really bad
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.260]   Linus Torvalds the creative Linux called them garbage
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.740]   and
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.740]   Microsoft
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:03.540]   Actually stopped pushing them out and and even companies even put out tools to remove the firmware fixes
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:09.380]   Is apple bit by any of this no so apple did not rush to implement
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.220]   Intel's
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.980]   Microcode and I don't want to speak for them
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:17.700]   But my guess is that they they were probably thinking more like Linus and they were like Microsoft
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:23.460]   This stuff really needs to be vetted so what apple did is they because the only known exploits right now for specter are
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.140]   JavaScript based through the browser
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:32.340]   They patched webkit and safari to prevent those types of attacks while they could properly vet the america code and turns out they don't have to vet this first
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:39.940]   So really nice they they have they dodged a bullet a bullet microsoft and it's an OEMs did not dodge
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:46.500]   Yeah, I mean some people think that they're slow, but they are really careful about that those sorts of things. Yep. Does the
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:52.340]   Does the T1 chip have any effect on the security based on those those exploits?
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:58.100]   Those chips aren't effective. Well the T1 and T2 aren't affected by it because they're not primary processing units. No, but I don't know
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.660]   Do they protect you they don't but they don't protect you at all. No
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.620]   They're not used involved in processing there
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.500]   Protecting a secure secure enclave. They're doing the fingerprint right right. I didn't think so, but I just wanted to make sure
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.220]   Doing interesting things the T2 does weird things in the iMac pro we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago like
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.540]   Manage the memory chips. It's replaced. It's all control. Yeah
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:23.460]   All the controllers it's hard it's hard to overstate exactly how big a problem this is and how
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:30.180]   Deed how detail the problem of mitigating this problem is going to be. I'm not surprised there was this kind of shake up
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.300]   So soon after the revelation of the problem
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.140]   I mean, I'm surprised that
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.460]   I think it's a sort of problem where you really have to get right on it and saying that it's telling your customers that
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.940]   We're where the problem where we're the series of the problem
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:46.740]   We're pushing out updates to try to start to fix the problem, but it's not going to be fixed for years
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.540]   the thing that's frustrating is
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.140]   The intel seems to have known about this for a long time
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.780]   in fact warned
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.580]   Two of its chinese oem months before it warned anybody in the united states
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:05.620]   Lenovo and somebody else were told about these problems. What was it in june?
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:11.300]   Um, they found out about it. Yeah, and the government was not informed at all and it's just uh
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:16.580]   And because that intel has actually in all likelihood had had more than a year to work
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.660]   on these fixes the fact they rushed
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:25.780]   Non-functioning fixes out so quickly all of this does not reflect well at all until it's just terrible
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.660]   And it's part of that their initial resources for bad too. Yeah, they they blamed I mean it was
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.500]   It's very sad to be honest. It's just terrible
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.060]   Um
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.620]   Okay, uh, okay. I got another one for you
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:44.180]   Uh, this is ena freed's scoop. Yes enaxios
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.940]   Uh, she says that uh craig fedderiki
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.060]   Had a special
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:57.940]   Employees meeting earlier this month where he announced a new plan for ios and then he and some top lutenants
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.900]   Wisked off to a company off site
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:06.180]   They've shaken up apparently they're according to ena their plans for ios
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:14.420]   For 2018 they're going to focus on reliability and performance and less so on new features
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.460]   Or even adding features to core apps like mail
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.260]   Yep, I think that's great
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:25.460]   Yeah, they've done this before they did it with high sierra. They did it with snow lepso. Yes, and yes and no
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:30.260]   So the snow leopard and high sierra were marketing spins on no user-facing features
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:34.500]   So it's like well, we have grand central dispatch and we have exchange
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.500]   But you know, no one's going to care about those
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   Let's just say no front let neck known you features and high sierra was similar
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:47.540]   It had very few user-facing features, but they had incredibly deep foundational changes things like a new windowing server
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.420]   on high sierra and
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:55.540]   The new file system and those were fundamental changes and both snow leopard and high sierra were incredibly painful
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:01.460]   When they were first launched because of the deep changes and they became much better through subsequent releases where this is like
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:06.740]   They're not going to make the foundational changes in ios 12. They are all they are only going to freeze
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.660]   The user-facing features and that means that you'll have like
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:18.260]   It's way better than snow leopard or high sierra situation because you're not going to have the problems associated with architectural changes while they're busy fixing
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.980]   Bugs and other systems
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:26.100]   It also seems like they're going to be adding without really talking about an infrastructure that will pay off in great features
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.100]   A year and a half or two years from that release
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.780]   Sometimes you really do have to do this that you have to put peta you have to pay a lot of money to have the wiring
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.940]   Upgraded to have the pipes upgraded. It doesn't it's not sexy
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:43.620]   It's not as cool as redoing a kitchen, but that means that you can redo the kitchen you can put in a new bathroom
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.700]   You can't do it until you
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.540]   You get into the walls of the operating system and as i'm
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:56.100]   Increasingly convinced that apple really does think that ios is their entire future not just an important part of their future
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.220]   I really think this is going to prepare them for the next big leap
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:05.220]   The next the first device that has ios and a keyboard built into the same device and maybe a trackpad
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.260]   I think you're going to see the foundations of this in this next release
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.540]   Man, you got to wait a year for the new home screen now leo everyone who complained about bugs is going to complain you have to wait another year
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.820]   Oh, yeah, that's one of the things you're not going to redo springboard, huh?
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.180]   Yeah, just imagine the cheers they would get if they just said
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:26.660]   If all if the entire demo the kraig federiggy did was he hold he long presses on the stock zap
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.060]   Tresses the x button and it disappears
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.780]   Imagine he would they would have to people be throwing chairs. That's all they gotta do
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.060]   Do that didn't they do that with the last version they did do that now
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.500]   Yeah, but it doesn't really delete it. It just takes it
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:45.220]   No, now it does so it'll last last year they would hide it and then you could read you could re show it in the app store
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:49.060]   But now you can actually get rid of it. It's actually gone. Yeah, I took it off
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.260]   I took it off mine according to
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:57.300]   Before you go on what's really funny is one of the biggest complaints we get on android central is a lack of a built-in stock
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:03.300]   Grimey you can't will it can't win can you
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:08.020]   I never asked that question that I wanted to ask rene about about home putt
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.060]   Oh, yeah, oh what's your lot of people thinking?
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:17.060]   I just wanted I wanted to ask since it seems as though everything has to stream from from apple either through
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:24.980]   I cloud or through apple music is we are we going to notice a difference between the uncompressed?
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.700]   Apple lossless files that I've got on mice
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:33.860]   I would play directly for my server the right tunes and the stuff that I'm going to be the compressed stuff. I'm going to be streaming
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.580]   from kupertino
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:41.300]   So I again, I'm not an audio file so I'm probably the worst person to answer this but
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:46.900]   And also like people say they hear a difference but a lot of people can't tell a difference over 256
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.180]   Whatever it is. They see it's not bad. I'm kill a bit per second anyway
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.340]   So I think it's more data for the home pod
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.580]   But I don't know if someone like me would be able to tell a difference
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.740]   So I'm curious for someone who actually could to hear it
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:02.820]   But it should it should just be treated as better data from the home pod than the the compressed stuff. Okay
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.180]   Another mark german scoop
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:12.740]   He says apple is now I don't know how this relates to the next version of iOS or if this may be now
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.900]   It's on the back burner
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:20.900]   But apples apparently according to mark in a redesigned iBooks they're going to take out the i just call it books
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.140]   They've hired an executive from amazon
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.820]   To help they're going to go hard after the digital
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:32.020]   Bookmark at the app which german says is due to be released in the coming months
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.660]   We'll have a simpler interface
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.140]   The better highlights books currently being read a digital bookstore that's been redesigned
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:41.940]   Kind of like the app store was redesigned
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:46.180]   I don't think any that'll help and there's a new reading now section
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.500]   It's pretty good things that are super interesting here
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.940]   One is that I think this will be timed exactly when the previous justice department order against apple finishes
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.980]   It was all the previous stuff about there
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.620]   So they can probably again do most favored nation claw
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:04.180]   They can't do it the same way that it before but it'll give them an opportunity to sort of more forcefully reenter
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:09.300]   The e-book market which was completely shut down with that amazon lawsuit a couple years ago
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:14.820]   But also this is a separate the iOS team is cragfairy because organization and if memory serves and i might be wrong
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.900]   About this, but I think books is still under eddy
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.540]   Q, so I mean it'll work on that
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.620]   It's probably different than work on ios 12
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:29.700]   You know if you were going to make an argument to let apple back into this market you'd show this graph amazon has gained huge market share since
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.180]   the 2015
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:36.180]   Almost like being they kind of knew this would happen if they managed to get their way
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:44.820]   From 74 percent of the e-book sales to 83 percent apple has dropped from 11 percent to 9 percent bnn
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:48.580]   Yes, they're still around barns an oval 8 percent to 4 percent
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.860]   So apple's really the only credible competition at this point
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.140]   For a monopoly in e-books by amazon
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.620]   I think you could make an argument with the department of justice that maybe you should really let apple
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:05.780]   I forget who said this but there was a really caddy statement where someone said if what we need is books anywhere like we have movies anywhere
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:10.660]   So that you're allowed to take the books that you bought and have them authorized on any platform
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.620]   And then that would stop the need to sue apple or just sue amazon
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.740]   You could just buy your book where you wanted and read it the way you want it
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:23.460]   And because books probably won't go drm free anytime soon and until then it's really going to be hard to get any wedge out of amazon at all
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:29.460]   I mean the I think that the apple's mistake here is not that they don't have a good store or not because they didn't compete well
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.540]   It's because they're not forcing
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:36.740]   e-bookmakers to compete at a different level so the the issue is since you know books are gruel
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:42.900]   Let's be clear. I mean like it is like this is a this is a thousand years old technology that we just put into an electronic form
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:49.140]   I mean there is so much opportunity on an ipad to make it interactive to make to add video to add all these other things
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.580]   And what apple needs to do to do that is a have a development platform that doesn't suck
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.900]   Better than ipooks creator
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:56:01.140]   You were so excited when i was excited about the possibility of ipooks creator and then they never developed like they never added
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.540]   They never made it easy to really build those complex pieces
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:09.300]   And here's the other thing is is they needed to spend what apple should have done is spent a billion dollars on creating content
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:15.220]   You know like like let's show what can people like show people great things and what the mistake that they made is they went to
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:21.860]   Um, you know, they went to piercein and they went to all these guys to talk about textbooks and these old companies just screwed them
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:26.180]   They took the money and they ran and they gave they created really crappy things rather than
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:30.500]   When you look at almost any of these other launches whether it's for google or facebook or whatever
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:35.940]   They're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on seeding the idea so that people can see what's possible
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:40.260]   You know, you know, robo recall, which is probably the best example of of 360 games
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:44.500]   You know that was paid for by oculus like it's not that wasn't like a you know
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:47.140]   They they you know and you get to see what's possible and if apple
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:54.340]   A spent real money and real development and real training on iBooks an iBook author and actually developed it into this incredible
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.980]   Platform and be paid people to build the next generation of books
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:04.260]   They could force amazon and everybody else to compete where there's this new thing of books
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:09.460]   The kind of books that my kids are going to probably end up wanting to use and then or you could go back to the thousand-year-old
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.420]   Technology, which is what he books really is right now. I couldn't agree more
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:17.540]   Yeah, but but you you keep back into the same problem of how are you going?
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:22.180]   And let's say they've got a development budget to make a really good 21st century of whatever book
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.500]   I'm working on whether it's a textbook nonfiction, whatever
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:29.860]   How are you going to convince me to get into a locked-in platform with iBooks that would all that requires
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.220]   a
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:38.580]   Really expensive for the market reader in order to access when I can simply hire really good web developers to create
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.300]   standalone facsimiles of what
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:46.420]   Sites like the New York Times is doing for their their and vox are doing for their content
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.860]   It's what are you going to do to make it better than if you did like the article like the article they posted
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.380]   about
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.260]   Celebrities and other people like buying twitter followers
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:01.060]   They really punch that up that article and enhanced it with not just do-dads that make it more
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.500]   Involving but that really put a lot of the data that across so much better than static text
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:11.460]   So how are you going to make this make the claim that the minimum buy-in is going to be not
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:16.580]   Any any hundred dollar 200 dollar Chromebook, but you have to have at least a three hundred dollar
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.860]   Three hundred or twenty dollar iPad in order to access this content for five years
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.700]   You pay the right people to do to build the you know you underwrite their cost
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.260]   You offset the the thing to get people to do it
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:30.580]   I mean that's how and then what happens is is that is people now see a bar
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:35.860]   Where if you're making you know and apple has the money to do this and if apple wants to take this market
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.980]   That's the only way they're going to do it. They are not going to do it by making a better
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:44.020]   You know a little widget that competes with amazon if they don't change what books are about
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.380]   They're never going to compete in this market. They've lost they lost the initiative on that a long time ago
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:54.260]   If you know i'm not saying that they can compete, but i'm saying the only way that they're going to compete is if they
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.820]   uh is if they change
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.620]   Literally just change the playing field somewhere else and that's
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:04.740]   And that's going to cost billions and they have billions to do that
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.820]   You know and the thing is is they you know you look at netflix netflix takes every vertical
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:12.500]   They're not taking they're not trying to make sure that you watch all of their shows
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:18.660]   They're looking at everything from cooking to to this to this to this and they fill all those spaces really effectively
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.780]   You know and and the thing is is that and and they're paying for that
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.940]   They're not hoping that people are going to come up with that and and it started off a little rocky
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:31.780]   But now i mean they're knocking it out of the park and and and the thing is is that in all of these companies when they launch a new product
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:35.060]   What they do is they see it they spend lots and lots of money in apple
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:38.900]   You know the same thing with this is the same problem i think that they're having with home home kit
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.020]   Is apple things that they should just build it and everyone will come
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.140]   You know because they they do a lot, you know that that works
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:49.860]   But but for something where they've lost the initiative or they don't have that that they're not the first ones
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.780]   I think that they need to
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:57.460]   Pay their way in by developing lots of content that that gets to a point where you're kind of embarrassed if it's just a book
[00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.180]   But that that'll take billions of dollars at this point thinking to catch up
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.500]   But I think that that would make you know a huge difference the article and he was referring to
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:11.380]   Was the article New York times did about the follower factor and watches i scroll through it for those of you watching on video
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.380]   This is what you're talking about right? Andy is this is just really interesting way
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:23.140]   They've made this more than just a a newspaper article. These are people's faces. Yeah, it's a long it's a long article when you get to the bottom
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:31.060]   They're they're providing scatter graphs of the rate at which certain accounts are attracting followers and how it's absolutely
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:36.340]   You can absolutely see the spikes of when they were buying 25 000 followers or buying 100 000 followers
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.380]   So it's not just that that's a really nice header
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.660]   That those transitions between pictures that get you kind of interested
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:46.740]   But look at how it's it's explaining how these bots work
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:51.220]   As you as you drag through it. That's that's what i'm getting at it's
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.860]   There's been times a whole department just doing this stuff, but I would say and if
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:00.740]   And if and I agree that if apple had been sort of investing in that sort of stuff
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:06.420]   Uh, even if they were able to say you need the safari browser for now at some point wink wink
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.460]   We will open source it so you can put it into any browser with a plug-in
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.700]   But I I have a problem
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.820]   I don't know how I would convince somebody to do an iBook as instead of a really really rich web app
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.700]   I also don't know at this point how I would convince someone to buy an iBook
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:27.860]   As opposed to buying a kindle book. I hate i hate monopolies, but when there the fact is up for me
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:36.180]   For me subjectively, I can I can I even actively recommend people don't buy iBooks and don't buy a google book
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:40.340]   Because you've got that you got the keys to the kingdom if you buy this as a kindle
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:44.260]   If if all you're going to do is text absolutely it is a complete waste of time
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.620]   And and what they have in the new york times here. This is about 15 percent of where it could go
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:53.060]   I mean, I think that elements which is which is an app that was developed very early on in the ipad thing is is like
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:59.780]   60 percent of where you where you should be able to go with an interactive app and the problem is is the development tools for those kinds of things are really hard
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.540]   You know and and and they can they could be easier. They could be drag and drop
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:08.100]   They could be you know a lot of other things and and and I think that there is
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:13.140]   There is so much that this could go into is changing the paradigm of what we look at because text is
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:17.140]   You know, it's a highly efficient compression technology that requires a lot of
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.340]   You know, cpu power on the end code in the decode, you know
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.460]   And so the thing is is that is that you know, and it's it's old
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:27.700]   I mean, it's a thousand years old and and this is a little better than than that
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.620]   But when you're talking about adding movies when you're talking about 3d animations when you're talking about, you know
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.100]   And again elements the app was probably the closest to that
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.740]   I bought it as soon as it came out and was excited about it
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:40.420]   But still developing it that they still you still had to use xcode to build that you know
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.980]   And you could not build that with and you should be able to build elements
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:47.220]   Specifically as as near drag and drop, you know
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.340]   On iBooks what with modern hypercard. Yeah. Yeah, that's kind of what it is
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.100]   Isn't it the generation of hypercard?
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.340]   But apple has to change that paradigm or they have no chance
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.220]   You're absolutely correct
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.100]   No one should i buy all my books on Kindle because if it's just gonna be books
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.180]   I'm not gonna commit to anything, you know, and so
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.980]   I use iBooks primarily to save all the pdfs of all the tech manuals
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.900]   I buy everywhere because there's some of the books are still region locked in certain
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.340]   Platforms to certain countries and I have to go hunting and finding them
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.620]   You know, it didn't occur to me until this moment that as
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.700]   When you write the history of microsoft you taught you have to write a big section about
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.140]   How their inability to see the importance of mobile
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:30.020]   Just cut them off at the knees for whatever they could have done for their next big leap
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:35.220]   I think that with apple their inability to see the value of what they had in hypercard and hypertext
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.260]   If they had just simply said guess what you guys get your own building you can put your own pirate flag over it
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.380]   Just keep developing hypercard like keep developing hypertext
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:49.220]   And quick time VR interact with them. Yeah, I mean they they could have they could have been so ready for html
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.140]   They could have been so ready for the web
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.980]   Basically, we would have forgotten that it would have been just like all the
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:04:01.940]   All the subroutine calls excuse me all the library calls are start with ns because we don't we forget that it stands for next step
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:07.140]   We will we don't know people wonder wonder why are we calling this this text view a card?
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.500]   Well because we are because it all started with hypercard
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.260]   You're using hypercard version 113 in 2018
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:21.220]   I just I still you know metaphorically weep for the death of what would even today be an amazing
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.260]   Communication and distribution and development tool
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.500]   The tools that we built into quick time
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:32.740]   You know where you could actually select items and have them pop up and show you extra videos and have multiple layers and all of those things
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.820]   That got all stripped out a quick time
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.500]   Are still things that I can't easily do anything anywhere else, you know and and they were way ahead of that
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.340]   And I think that yeah definitely gave up too early
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.340]   But again, I think that in this case there's
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:50.660]   There's so much that's possible and it's so exciting and it's just still so difficult to build that those tools
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.860]   And I think that there are a lot there
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.060]   I mean with final cut being what it is and motion being what it is
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:05:00.580]   Those are all things that are development tools and I think that the idea of iBooks in some ways
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.620]   It might be why Apple spends so much money on continuing to
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.420]   You know evolve those products and why they don't just
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.980]   You know, I mean they've made plenty money they make plenty money every year to pay for the engineering team
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:16.580]   So it's not that big of a deal but it's but it um, but it seems like an odd thing that they keep this video thing over here
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.060]   But from a development perspective, I think it makes a lot of sense
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:22.180]   They just have to build the tools to do that and again, they have to pay people to do it
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.900]   That's how you get people off the ground as you spend billions of dollars
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.220]   uh paying people to produce content until it gets off the
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:34.820]   It's called priming the pump timely article yesterday in bloomberg business week
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:41.780]   A shiro ov the ipad lost years for apple's media partners. She even starts by saying apple
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:47.540]   Is revamping its digital bookstore in another attempt to take out amazon's dominance? I can't help thinking
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:51.620]   What if exactly as we've been talking about the missed
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:58.500]   Opportunity she also points out that uh a number of publishers lost their shirt
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:01.380]   uh, including news corp
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.580]   Uh, right remember the daily
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:07.300]   um and uh
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:12.500]   The parent companies of s choir magazine fortune better homes and gardens created a joint venture
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.180]   To do a ipad magazine subscriptions
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:21.380]   And the hindsight it was a waste and jobs led them all in a costly detour
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.260]   I don't know if you can blame their failings
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.740]   Uh, they were okay. I mean all of those were okay too. I mean they were still like web designers
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:32.740]   I agree there. Yeah, it wasn't like rethink. It was an innovators. No, we're pretty
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:39.860]   Yes, that we're just shoveled onto the ipad if you watch the grammys on sunday night. You saw the return of animoji karaoke
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:44.100]   and it credits a harry macraken for inventing this this is
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:49.540]   I learned uh about a artist named childish gamby no from watching the
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.300]   Grammys
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.860]   This is the apple ad although it I noticed it's
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:00.820]   At the end it says atent so i wonder if it's an apple ad or an atent yeah, dual by dual by marketing dollars
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.740]   We've got aliens
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:07.060]   unicorns
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.940]   Now by the way
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.940]   As they say in the fine print
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.420]   You can't really do this with animoji
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:17.620]   Yeah, it only records 10 seconds at a time
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.860]   You need to keep the content a lot of work
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:25.140]   And you need a lot of video editors working all around the clock to produce this effect
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:29.700]   There's robot heads and kitty cats and pandas and pigs all you're singing
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.460]   If you watch this on acid, it would be awesome. I think I am on acid
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:36.820]   I'm having a flashback for sure. It's all in the aliens eyeball and
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:44.180]   They also did uh me goes culture uh for uh, which was up for best rap album
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.580]   Here's a dog doing the rap
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.300]   And a little animoji poop
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.340]   Up and out on the side
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:58.660]   It's a it's a it's a great ad i i
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:04.900]   I hope that they're communicating that this isn't something that a multi-billion dollar company spent hundreds of millions of dollars to produce
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.780]   This is you staring into your phone and goofing with your friends
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.300]   Well
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.660]   Yeah, and I come on is anybody still using animojis
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.860]   And I think the way when the lion comes out the lion and the dragon are coming out
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.180]   Really a selling point for the iPhone
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:23.620]   Here's the thing it makes you know if you only use it for if you only you will definitely use it for the first week
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:30.660]   You have this phone. Yes, and then it will convince you of how awesome this face ID thing is and you'll be so ready for whatever next
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.980]   I agree that's I think it's like on the apple watch
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.340]   You know sending sketches to your friends and sending your heartbeats
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:43.940]   It's something that locks you it's something that makes sure you don't return it within two weeks because you are you are well invested into how cool the
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.660]   Totally of the hardware is I can tell you my my kids are very upset with my wife that she has a tenon
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:54.580]   I mean she doesn't have the newest phone because she's because they can't do them and send them to me in which they would do constantly
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.300]   Here are the four new and emoji that you were referring to mr
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:06.260]   Renee ritchie. There's the dragon the bear not a panda, but a brown bear a skull
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.940]   And I will be using a lion a lot and ufasa
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.820]   What I don't understand is is why apple hasn't already and why they didn't start to it
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.140]   This is another example of iBooks in in my opinion
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:21.380]   Is they've got this great thing and they're not tying it into like star wars was released
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:25.860]   Why didn't we have a bunch of star wars characters when you know when the next uh, event is cool
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.740]   By the way exactly what why aren't we having?
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:35.860]   Why aren't we seeing tons of an emojis that are attached to all these different characters and and you know and and and time like there should be a
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:41.060]   New animojis all the time that people are playing with uh rather than yeah, and they should give us more than 10 seconds
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.060]   This is apple. We need a nickname k jam and emoji. Yeah, that's good
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.420]   billion dollar app on nick cage and emoji. There you go
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:55.460]   But this is apple they come up with stuff. I know they throw it out there lots of excitement and then just let us just show off
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.460]   The arkets face detection and it'd be really nice that they made it easy for developers to make
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.620]   Like they do sticker and then lucas disney could release the avengers
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.700]   Fate uh, you know animoji pack let them do it like stickers right
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   Because apple just doesn't update fast enough for that's like snapchat
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.660]   Filters all the time apple is still doing these model thick updates
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:19.860]   And it's really not fast enough for the web world like for the insta people who use instagram and snapchat
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.980]   But if they you know stickers were okay a lot of people don't use stickers anymore
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.060]   But still at least they allow for much greater velocity than the built-in stuff
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.660]   Here's something maybe you'll use more business messaging in the next version of messages
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.660]   But
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:43.860]   Well placed can't wait to message with lows about my new purchases
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:47.060]   What which is the health record?
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.420]   So if you're provider, oh, yeah part of the partnering project
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.740]   You'll have access to all your health records inside the health app which a lot of people are really excited about
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:00.340]   That's that's that's incredible. There's a new there's a new industry independent platform for
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:07.700]   uh, basic sort of an RSS for health records that can be used between devices and the ability to simply have your health app
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:12.420]   Simply collect information from your health care providers saying you're your inoculations here your
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:18.420]   Immunizations here's here's what your allergies are also that the results of your last blood work are back
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:23.220]   Here is what your your cholesterol was here's what your heart rate was i do that with an app right now
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:28.980]   My provider kizer does that but it'd be sure nice to have it all ported to apple health
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.820]   And you know who is going to do it by the way?
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.580]   This was actually i think the one of the biggest stories of the day he has nothing to do with apple
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.500]   But amazon is partnering with bircher Hathaway and jp morgan
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.780]   To create a health plan for their own employees
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:48.580]   Which i am convinced is a first shot at amazon health that that is that is the next
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:53.380]   Yeah, i really amazon would like to participate in and there'll be a very tech focused
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.940]   Of course, uh health solution
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.540]   Do you want to take a percentage from every transaction in the world as a big one
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.220]   Yeah
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.620]   Wouldn't it wouldn't it be lovely if amazon instead of doing that actually gave their employees
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:11.940]   There's especially their factory their warehouse workers good benefits job security. They weren't just on three month, uh three month pay
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.660]   Uh three month contracts that which that make it impossible to go into full-time work
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.700]   I really there's there's i love amazon
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.380]   But the thing that i dislike the most about them is how they handle
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:28.660]   Their lowest paid workers because i think that really defines how well they treat their customers
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.900]   And excuse me i think that that defines how well a company treats its customers
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:36.660]   How well does it take to treat its own lowest paid employees? Right?
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:42.500]   Uh, let's see i think uh, we get the grammys we got the home pods
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.260]   We got the brazilian carnival selfies
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:54.740]   There's a new uh, an even more original content coming from apple this time from damian chazelle
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.380]   Who of course was the director of lala land?
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.820]   Variety says chazelle will write and direct a new drama
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:04.660]   With a with the plot and other details being kept secret for the time
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.860]   This is again for this whatever apple plans to do with all this
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:13.380]   Amazing is this kind of deal like marvel and at the end all of these shows will team up for a mini series
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.260]   We're jennifer aniston fights battle star galactic
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:22.900]   No, I think that was what's happens when like you're the show runner and your show has been doing okay
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.820]   But you don't know how well it's going and then they tell you that oh congratulations
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:32.500]   Your show is now being moved under the management team of the apple tv like oh damn
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:38.820]   I was okay. Well, we'll wrap up our storylines all excited when I heard that chazelle's doing a biopic of niel armstrong
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.460]   The first man on the moon. It's called first man till I found out he's cast ryan gosling
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:49.300]   As niel armstrong. It's like there's like only three actors in hollywood right now feels like chris pime chris pratt
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:53.540]   And like there's like there's an every movie. I think chris pratt would have made a good new
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.580]   As long as they don't mean gosling sing again. I I dance. I guess i'll be
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.580]   Plus he might be a replicant
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:06.660]   Such an opportunity
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.740]   See him run through that wall
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:15.220]   Uh, there's a lot more of stuff weird kind of stuff apple is killing
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:19.700]   ftp in the terminal in icera, which is probably good
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:25.460]   So they took um macos server and they moved a lot of the stuff that was really cool like icloud
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:30.100]   Cashing and things into the main line of macos and for a lot of the services
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:36.740]   What apple used to do is take open source services repackage them put apple gooey on them and put them into the server
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:42.180]   And I think it's just it's become too much given the way the company is focusing its attention on mainstream customers
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:47.300]   So they're now saying just go get that stuff directly from the open source community. They're updating it faster than we are
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.540]   It's more secure than the version we currently have
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:54.580]   And some people are really upset about that because they appreciated apple packaging and giving it a gooey and all these things
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.820]   But apple just feels like they they can't do the best job of that anymore and they're going to focus server
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.020]   on things like ipad in the classroom administration and
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:09.140]   Direct managing storage in production companies and the things that they find that their current customers are doing the most of
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   You and I think what I'd like them to get rid of is ns url session d
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:20.500]   I even know what that is, but it's bad. I could tell so it's all the background transfers that apple does
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.900]   You know and when i'm on a plane flying back from london let's say
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.220]   Maybe yesterday
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:32.580]   And I can see that i'm i can see that i'm getting 150 megs or 150 kilobytes kilobytes per second
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:39.060]   Coming down, but I can't actually check my email because when I look at what's actually happening. Thank you iced that menu
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.620]   Um, I can see that ns
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:47.940]   Ns url session d is using all of the bandwidth. Yeah, it'd be nice for them to look at going
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.220]   Hey, by the way
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:54.260]   If i'm on a and this and then I then you search it you find out there's a whole bunch of people that are like that have low bandwidth connections
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.420]   And they're like what is going on?
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:00.420]   And there's you know apple. I really like if they're gonna do like a bunch of fixes
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:07.540]   I didn't even know what ns set url session d was until yesterday and but I was desperately trying to check email and and just
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:13.540]   It kill it every once in a while even my amac pro gets like molasses. I bet you that's what it is
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:17.060]   It's just kind of something right in that movement. It's it's updates. It's iCloud
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:21.380]   It's all those things are sitting inside of that but there's got to be a place that they should have a switch
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:25.940]   This is this is back of that battery thing that they should have a switch somewhere and says now i want to turn this off for now
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:32.100]   You know, I just walk here's the here's the tech now prepare for changes to macOS server in spring 2018
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:38.580]   Here's all the things they're killing and it is a lot of stuff dns dhcp
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:44.820]   The mail stuff the messages stuff net install vpn basically there is no more
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.060]   I actually really liked it that they built a wiki into macOS server, but you know
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:54.420]   Here's the solution. It's called home brew you have a bsd machine
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.100]   Get to know your command line and install all this stuff
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.580]   It as apple says it's more up to date
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:05.780]   You know, it's being kept up to date by the developers. You don't need apple to package it for you. Just get home brew
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:09.460]   And you've got a package manager for macOS and you can install everything
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:14.820]   Including all i would guess most of those things there'll be a few things that you won't be able to
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.460]   Replace but most of the stuff in here you can
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:21.380]   All right, let's take a break and

[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:33.780]   We were talking about the home potty went to order the home pot and his his shopping cart was $9 000
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:36.900]   That's like what happened
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.220]   Extra leftover when we were talking about pricing iMacs. I had priced out
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:46.420]   Almost hit go and it was like literally almost hit by and
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:53.540]   I'm a pro by the deviolay speaker. There we go. Wait, did Alex add a red raven by accident?
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:58.740]   I have to say I love that iMac pro and I you know, I'm not challenging it in any way
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.900]   I have your photos. I haven't done it yet. I will do that. All right
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.620]   I meant to do it before today, but I'll do it before I should send you a
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:08.660]   I should send you a file for you to use that way. It's the exactly the same one good
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:12.340]   Do that and then it just references put that in the drop box you shared and I will do that yeah
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:15.300]   Really really cool
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.780]   What do you got for us this week mr. Lindsay got two little ones
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:22.740]   Yeah, so like the first one
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.940]   So there's a face rig
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.940]   Um, which is by the way does not require your um
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.580]   You don't have to have an iPhone 10 to use this
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:39.380]   um so face rig is I don't know where this is happening with face rig but um but you can actually do
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.460]   It's lots and lots of different
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.140]   Yeah, so you can have like lots of people so you can send messages with you as
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.540]   I don't know if you can send them over messages, but you can record them
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.660]   But they have they have Donald Trump they have you know like an I
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.660]   You know, I think that and what happens is a free download and then of course you do what I do
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.060]   Which is you buy a whole bunch of faces and do a bunch of things
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.980]   I want to do this is this for the iphone
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:02.100]   It's for the iphone and I guess it works on webcams as well and everything else
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:08.180]   But you can like send um, you know, it actually does it it does it about as good a job as as
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:12.660]   As the iphone does on its own except there's just lots of different characters that you can kind of play with
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.460]   So given what we were talking about they call it digital cosplay
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.100]   Yeah, and it's just there's so many you know
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.740]   There's so many things that you can kind of play around with there
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:21.620]   And again
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.900]   I look at it as if when you look at some of the characters they have there because they do do some popular ones like like Donald trump
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.740]   And uh in hilary clinton and i get to all my impressions
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:35.380]   You could do a lot of you could have a lot of back uh, you know, you can have a lot of fun with it
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:39.060]   But you see the possibility of people creating eventually content
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:44.260]   For this that's you know that you'd see on youtuber facebook or whatever that is
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:48.580]   You know utilizing some of these different pieces and so it's just
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:53.380]   It's a lot of fun. So it's free to get the basics. Yeah, you can play with it. It's by
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:57.060]   Downloadable and tell them how much for free it's it's a lot of fun
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:00.100]   And then if you like it you can add a bunch of faces to it how much of the faces
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:04.020]   Oh, they're like a you know, they're like a dollar here dollar there. It's that typical like, you know
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:08.100]   It's before you know what you spent $20 and you're like, well, you got a whole bunch of things and so
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.540]   But it's what happens. It's like, oh, I really want that one
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:18.100]   I want that one and so it's a it's a fun little app. It says remember to calibrate your neutral expression
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:22.580]   Yes, so you're resting its face. It's it's the direction and everything else
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.740]   Okay, day one login six ten creds awarded
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.260]   Okay, so this is calibrating my neutral. How do I do that?
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:36.100]   My name is rocket raccoon
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.820]   I live in my room
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.060]   That's cool
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:44.740]   It's really a detail so much better than an emoji right
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:50.580]   Wow, there's a lot too amazing that that's a that's a trademark violation of a trademark violation
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:56.740]   That's a that's two levels D two levels D baby. It's supposed to be rocky rocket raccoon, but I keep us not
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:01.380]   But then it rocket raccoon was supposed to be rocky raccoon from the Beatles, but they had to change the name. That's
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:05.860]   There we go. That's inception of IP theft. So that's my neutral face
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:12.740]   I don't know now. Let me see what else I can do here. So you got lots of uh, got a kitty cat put a tat
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:20.260]   I got a cosplay blue hair girl fave fairy. Oh, what is that? Oh, that's like a dragon
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.860]   Oh
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:24.580]   You do have to get the angles right. It doesn't do like angled
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:32.420]   You know like yeah, it does have to get that kind of uh, you have to get that like how you're gonna keep it. Oh, I could be a cheeseburger
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.420]   Hey
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.460]   Eat me
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.620]   Wait, it's a cheese in the right position. Yes, it is
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:41.060]   It is. Is it the wrong position? It's well. No, it's the right ish
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.100]   There's two layers of cheese one glued to the top one
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.740]   There's some french fries for eyebrows
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.740]   I don't know what my eyes are all of us. Oh, yeah
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.060]   Very nice
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:57.460]   Face trick. This is the most fun. I've had in years. I know I don't have no slaw hair
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:02.900]   You know, that's what it looks like. Hey cheeseburger smiles
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:10.100]   I want like face trick for for for hands only will put like go you know when you put you got your board during dinner
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.900]   So you put olives on your fingertips or or bugles
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.780]   Those just automatically think you look like you're bored during dinner
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:19.620]   You know what this is good because you could do this posted on instagram
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.100]   And
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:28.180]   And then people will go where can I get that snapchat filter exactly throw them off
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.980]   Doing an elephant
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:38.500]   Okay, you said you had to oh the second one I probably shouldn't recommend, but it's it was a little too much fun as goat simulator
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.500]   Have you seen goat simulator?
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.220]   Yes. Oh my god. Stop playing. He's running around
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:46.020]   Running into people with the goat
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.260]   Yeah, basically. There's a whole bunch of them now
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.380]   Like a variety of goat simulators. Yep
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.540]   Anyway, it's
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.660]   You feel a little like you shouldn't do this, but it's still fun
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.260]   So
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:03.060]   I swear to god if if I were giving a class on like iOS or mobile app development
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:10.580]   The first 10 minutes would be just running through goat simulator and then ending with now realize that there was no indication
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:16.660]   Whatsoever that this app could possibly be any kind of success and yet it is right?
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:22.420]   This is the environment you want you're trying to put yourself into with weeks and weeks of training right now
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:28.900]   So just keep that in mind if you think that this is you've got you've got a business plan for a wonderful app that you're going to take right to shark tank
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:34.260]   Well, and I well, I might my old thing is it's really buggy and it kind of works some of the time
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.460]   And it's kind of frustrating to run around a little bit once you get good at it. You're just kind of fun
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:41.540]   It's always fun. It's sometimes doesn't work, but it's always fun. Yeah, exactly
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:47.700]   Sorry, I'm still playing and I don't know how to get I don't know what any of the two or any of the points or four or anything else
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:52.900]   I just run around and just a white capo and they got up like hit the one app. Sorry. I can't Alex
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:56.260]   Yes, I want to be a goat face in goat. Oh my god
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.340]   Yeah, if you have your own face
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:04.660]   Doing it while it's and the big the big key is being able to do the jumping hit where you jump up and drop your drop the horns
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:06.820]   And and that's the and then you could have a facial
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:11.700]   Uh, you know expression as you did it. Yes, I think you're naturally making that facial just
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:14.580]   When you're doing it, you're like
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:16.180]   So great
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.500]   Andy Naco, you pick of the weeks, uh
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:24.260]   Mine is more of a second hand recommendation. So it's going to be kind of quick. Uh, it's clip studio paint
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:27.700]   Um, I had lunch with a friend of mine who is a professional artist
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.500]   And he couldn't stop
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.340]   praising this app
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:37.780]   Uh, by you'll recognize it as the from makers of manga studio, which is another name
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:41.860]   You come you you hear about a lot from professional artists who use
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.740]   Styluses on the desktop and on mobile devices
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:50.340]   Uh, but he was praising this particularly because he he said he had gone through pretty much every mac
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:53.220]   I'm act excuse me ipad pro app for art
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:55.700]   And they some of them are good some of them are bad
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:01.220]   But the one thing they all deficiency they all had in common was what happens when you are no longer on a book tour
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.340]   And now you're back at the studio. What do you do with the work that you created here?
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:07.620]   And the answer for most of the other apps is you export it as a
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:13.300]   Photoshop file or something and then you use that as the under drawing for whatever you're really going to do once you get back
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.700]   In the studio. He said that the ability to simply
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:22.660]   Pick up where I left off on the ipad pro on the mac with my with my pressure sensitive tablet is just perfect
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:26.740]   So I don't know I have no ability to test that but I after having lunch with them
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:29.300]   I looked around and saw a lot of people saying the same things
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:33.860]   I do recognize that art tools are an amazingly subjective call
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:38.340]   But if you're if you are a professional artist who can afford to spend real money on art tools
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:42.180]   And one of your big complaints has been i'm sick of spending eight hours
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:48.260]   Perfecting something on the ipad and then having to spend four hours just getting it into a position where I could use it in my
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:51.940]   My desktop workflow clip studio paint might be the thing to look for
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.940]   You do get a 30 day
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:56.660]   Free trial on the desktop app. I think a 60 day free trite
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:59.460]   I'm sorry a six month free trial on the ipad app
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:02.020]   So that'll give you a lot of time to figure out where there's going to be worth
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:06.420]   The depending on the version you get the 50 bucks or the 220 bucks for the real thing
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.060]   So as as as every good
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:14.420]   Every art app for the mac and the ipad the demo picks look amazing
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:17.860]   And i'm sure I could draw exactly like this if I only bought this app
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:22.660]   But it like I said there's enough consensus of that makes it's worth my
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.700]   Giving it the anti-anotco. I have not tried it myself
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:33.300]   But people who are smarter than me about this thing like this seal of well not approval, but i'm okay passing this this along
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:38.260]   Thank you, andrew. Thank you. Thanks. Sure. And now runny
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:42.100]   Hello
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:47.860]   I do have a couple of picks. The first one is just absurd a good friend and colleague of mine
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:52.740]   Derek kessler who some people might remember as the previous editor of web o s nation
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.540]   Well, that was still a tharink and he still works for mobilations now
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:30:01.940]   But he got a phone call or an email or something telling him that he had won two million dollars and a Mercedes
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:06.180]   Of course, they just needed a little bit of money from him to help them get there to give him his prizes
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.980]   And he managed to stretch that out into three weeks of just pure twitter
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:17.220]   Entertainment he he got back he invented a fake persona called steve trever
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:23.860]   And he started he he's a very good graphic designer and artist and he I don't want to spoil it for anybody
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:28.740]   But they kept they called him incessantly they texted him they had him try to mail them things
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:31.140]   They tried to convince him to hawk family heirlooms
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.580]   He went on and on for two to three weeks
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:42.100]   And it's just tailing off now, but if you have an hour and a cup of coffee, this is a phenomenal way
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.100]   to
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:48.340]   To just enjoy twitter for an evening and I can't stress enough just how well he played
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.780]   this particular scenario
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.860]   Just riveting riveting real-time entertainment stuff wow
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.180]   My uh
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:04.500]   Yeah, not not Brandon was the was the antagonist in this story and steve trever his his license does look in fact
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:08.260]   Exactly like christopher pines so it's all perfectly done
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:14.500]   My other pick is logic pro 10 version 10.4, which just came out
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.020]   Uh and the the release notes for it are a thing of beauty
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.580]   So I put a link instead of to the main website page
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:26.420]   But to the release note page and the reception to this that i've seen on a bunch of the forums is just outstanding logic pro
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:32.660]   They put a lot of effort into it and they brought over the smart tempo engine from music memos on the iphone
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:36.900]   Which lets you just throw a bunch of disparate audio adder and it'll figure out the tempo
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:42.900]   It's got new plugins like chroma verb which uses color to sort of indicate the different things it's got a vintage
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:48.020]   Vintage I forget what they're called filters not filters amps
[01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:55.860]   It's way too technical for me, but it's just got a ton of features a ton of new loops and I understand that loops are like the emoji of audio
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:59.140]   I don't know how that works, but people just super happy whenever there's new loops
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:03.460]   And it's got new drums and it's got it they fixed a ton of bugs
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:06.260]   They list a lot of the bugs they fixed and there's just a ton of stuff in there
[01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:09.700]   And if you're a fan of logic pro, it's I think the 20th free update
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.340]   Wow since they moved to the logic 10 platform
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:15.380]   It really is amazing. Yeah
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.580]   Yeah, nothing new for podcasters this time sadly, you know
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:22.660]   I hope when they they'll do a podcast specific release because we use it for all our podcast editing
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:27.620]   But for people who are into just making music it's it's a phenomenal not a new of good new stuff in there
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:30.180]   You know, I should probably try playing with logic
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:34.500]   For my audio edit. I still do a lot a lot of audio editing. I actually use
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:38.820]   A program that you know, it was for a long time using um, amadeus
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.820]   Amadeus pro
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.420]   And I've I've actually switched to a simpler inexpensive program
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.940]   I don't know if you guys are familiar with it. I mean, but maybe I should call twisted wave
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:51.940]   I'm wondering though. Maybe I should try logic. Maybe I need maybe I need something
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:57.460]   And on your eye on your eye mac pro leo it really scaled like they were doing demos with just hundreds and hundreds of
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:02.580]   I don't need that though particularly. I mean, mostly it's just my single voice and I'm cutting out breathing
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.820]   So for something like that twisted wave is
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:07.060]   Oh, there's a great feature that Jason sennell taught me
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:11.700]   Called strip silence where it just takes the auto track pulls out anything that's below a certain you can set the
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:16.100]   Patrol and then you can very easily move the stuff around like the little modules that are left around
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.540]   Yeah, actually twisted wave does that also
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:25.140]   Um, and he he told me he uses isotope for that for that too, which is another
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.980]   I suppose a lot of really good audio like to move echo and do a lot of cool stuff
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.780]   Well, I already bought logic pro ages ago
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:34.900]   Have a big drive if you want to download all the loops
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:41.380]   That's gigabytes gigabytes of stuff, but really well worth it and especially given that one
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:46.580]   Purchase many moons ago has paid off with 20 updates since that's pretty impressive
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.660]   Yeah, it's a really great team that works on it
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:51.620]   Uh, we are at a time
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:57.220]   But uh wasn't a lot of fun. This was thank you rene richy from i'more.com just down the road a piece

[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:07.620]   You know squad goals and all that so so at least they're there people who feel sympathy for my plight at having an inad
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.700]   Feeling like I have an inadequate instagram
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.260]   For january

[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:52.180]   It's not as though like I have posters of her but like her mirror presence every time I see her like at the on tv
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.180]   Like at the met ball or someplace. It's like
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:36:00.100]   It's amazing that she and I are made of essentially the same genetic material
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:08.420]   It's it seems as though i'm looking at something I am either too millennia behind where she's two millennia ahead so i'd have to be
