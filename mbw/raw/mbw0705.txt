[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we covered the latest news from Apple.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And we have the team-assembled, Lori Gill from iMOR.com, where she is the managing editor.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I have to tell you though, Lori, I don't know if pink hair will protect you against the virus.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   But it's worth a try.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm staying more than six feet away from everybody in my life, except for one person who happens to sleep in the same bed with me.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But I mean, I'm not going to sleep six feet apart from him.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   No, of course not.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Now, I just want to mention something to our team.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   There's a little arrow, right?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Right over Lori's forehead.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   There you go.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You moved it.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   A little mouse cursor right over there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's my new tattoo.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I got a cursor on my forehead.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   That would be very meta.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Very meta.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's a good idea.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   A little mouse pointer on your forehead.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Move your mouse.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I can't.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Also with us from iMOR.com and the host of the Vector Video Podcast, Richie.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Hi, Renee.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I try to figure out, do I need the grabby hand tattoo, then Leo?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That would be funny.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You know what?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I think just a little hour, you know, a little face and a watch face.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, the hourglass.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, our glass.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Beach ball.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Beach ball.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Because there's nothing resolving in there.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   If you only could get spinning tattoos.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Oh.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Andy, you not go from the Bichy, the WGBH in Boston?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's only because for 20 years, I said, from Chicago, sometimes.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Indeed, indeed.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I'm not sure if you're wearing it, and you need to do a firmware update in order to replace
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   it.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Laurie, if I hold on the option key, will I get two of you?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Option key drag and you copy, Laurie.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That would be useful, actually.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   That would be useful.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The funny thing about all of us is we all, except for me, we all work from our own homes.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We don't go out anyway.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   So this shelter in place order really hasn't affected anybody that much.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I'm guessing.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.100]   Well, it's affected me a little bit because now everybody is on Twitter saying the same
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.000]   sort of wise as comments that I usually say.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Because everybody else is without adult supervision.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now they know where it's likely.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Now they know what Andy's life has been like all these years.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Also, I can't get pancakes.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Dang it.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I was going to get pancakes on Sunday at the diner that's really awesome up the street.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Well, that would be wrong.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I should only do takeout.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And then the human brain is weird because on Tuesday in the state they announced, okay,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   no dying in anywhere in the state until further notice.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It was a decision that I already made.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   On Sunday, it was a smart decision, still a smart decision.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   But now the knowledge that I'm being forced to not do it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I wish I'd gotten those things.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Indeed a pancake like everybody else in the Bay Area.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.160]   For those of you watching a video, you probably noticed it looks a little different because
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.520]   I am not at the normal round table.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.760]   I am ensconced just a few feet away in my office.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.480]   But my office is off limits to everybody.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   I keep it locked.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.080]   And so it's a safe zone for me.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.160]   And then when I exit the office, I'm very careful.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.680]   I scuttle to the car very quickly.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.880]   There's only a skeleton crew here anyway.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.160]   I think there's only four or five people here.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.800]   We said almost everybody home, all our other hosts are going to be working from home.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.080]   And most of our producers, there's only, you know, engineers have to come in.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.280]   A few people have to come in.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.520]   But everybody else is home.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.720]   So we are taking it seriously.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.920]   I really want our staff to stay healthy as well.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.680]   And you know, as the oldest person on the staff, it's also, well maybe it's me and John.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.840]   It's also important that we be protected from them.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   So.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.480]   But just so you know.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.160]   We're following along.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.960]   I've got my alcohol in my pocket, my hand wipes are here.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   Everything's here.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.240]   I'm doing DIY like everybody else.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.480]   Or do you have your own supply?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.920]   I actually, the last time we flew, which was just, geez, foolish me a couple of weeks
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.440]   ago to St. Louis went to WWT and do an event there.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.800]   The airport had Purell.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.600]   So I have this much Purell.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.480]   I was just talking about that to a friend of mine.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.240]   That like we go like over the years, we go to all of these conferences and we either
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   like buy by hand sanitizer because we're going to the conference or because we're a speaker,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.720]   like they give us like an a goody bag.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.480]   And now it's like if you go through old luggage, you will find like half a dozen, a dozen little
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   balls of Purell.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.720]   And it's exactly like when you take out a jacket, you have an order in a year and you
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.600]   find a $20 bill in the pocket.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.440]   It's like, hey, well, look at this corner of the slap-top bag that I got for free for
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   speaking.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   Hey, look, two bottles of Purell.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.360]   Do we have to hoard bandwidth in case the world runs out?
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.720]   Do we have to like have a stockpile of bandwidth in our garage?
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.800]   There's plenty of toilet paper, water bandwidth.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   Actually, there is a little less bandwidth around here because a lot of people are working
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   at home.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.880]   Although it's interesting, I noticed that a lot of the internet service providers suddenly
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.440]   say, oh, we'll lift the bandwidth caps for the time being, which underscores the fact
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.040]   that they never really needed them, that the technology can handle it.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   It was...
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.000]   AT&T went down because so many people are still on the 3G network and they cut their 3G network
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.640]   so much that the 3G network couldn't handle it.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.840]   And some people I guess don't know that you can go and flip that switch to voice over LTE.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.240]   So they're still kind of, you can see them all the old fields network.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.520]   So on the other hand, I think we're going to all, you know, there'll be some interesting
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.080]   lessons from this among other things I think people have learning how to work from home.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   Schools are learning how to teach.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.840]   I've wondered for a long time, our son who's in high school has been in online learning
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.720]   for a while.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.480]   So his no change for him.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   He works at...
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480]   He goes to school at home.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.080]   He has teachers online.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.400]   He did have some tutors come in, but they'll be online as well.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.800]   So for him, this is really business as usual.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   And I think that I always wondered why there aren't more online schools.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.040]   I think there's a disadvantage.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.400]   You don't have that social element.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.480]   We've been the past on things to give him friends and stuff that he can hang out with
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.240]   so he gets that social element.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.440]   But I think that there's a lot of reasons why online schools might not be a bad idea.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.080]   I think we're going to learn a lot more about...
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.160]   I just feel like we're going to come out of this in a few months and it's going to be
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   a different world.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.600]   There used to be jokes, right?
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.680]   Like the person would say, "Oh, you went to stand firm with a bee.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   Where's that?"
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.400]   In online school in Arizona and then everyone would laugh and try to go on to work.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.240]   Online learning ain't bad, right?
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.360]   Must be hard for teachers who haven't done it before especially.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   We're learning a lot.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.120]   Now, movie studios are saying, "Well, what if we were to actually release movies like
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.600]   On Demand, Day in Date with the actual theatrical release?"
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   And they've tried it.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.400]   They've wanted to do that before but all the movie theaters, of course, are saying, "Look,
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.000]   if you announce that for any title, we are not going to be showing that title in our
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.120]   theaters because why would we help you cut our noses off?"
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.480]   But now they're like, "Okay, let's do this experiment because there are no theaters in
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.040]   which we can show these movies.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.880]   What if we can charge $20?
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.320]   Should we charge $40?
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.240]   Can we charge extra for a blockbuster movie or does it even make any sense to do that?"
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.200]   I think that at the end of this, a lot of different industries are going to be using
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.840]   this as... they're going to be taking a look at the data that they're seeing during this
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.080]   period to say, "Well, we didn't have the numbers to indicate what would happen if we
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.520]   tried this before, but now that we have the numbers, actually everybody was just as productive
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.000]   as they were before.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.680]   Our cost of maintaining a facility went way down and was just a good experience for a
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.080]   lot of people if not all of them."
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   So yes, let's try this.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   Incidentally, 20 bucks for like invisible now, I think is what I saw this morning.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:15.560]   Yeah, so NBCUniversal is making lemonade out of this lemon and releasing a lot of the
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.680]   movies that were going to come out in the big screen first direct to streaming.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.640]   Trolls World Tour, Invisible Man, The Hunt, which they had already pulled back once.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:34.800]   It was going to come out last fall and they decided it was kind of maybe inappropriate
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.840]   because it's all about conservatives hunting liberals with guns trying to shoot them.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.240]   And in September, I don't remember.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.240]   There were so many of them.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.160]   There was a mass shooting and they said, "Yeah, maybe we shouldn't release it now."
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.360]   So now it's released instead of challenging it in the theater.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.280]   Although people have told me it's a very good movie.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.400]   I don't know if I want to watch it right now, but it is $20 stream.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.120]   We don't have any conservatives in Quebec.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.720]   We lost them all in the quiet revolution.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.880]   We only have liberals and socialists now, so we're in trouble.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   We'll be nobody left.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.800]   It's liberals' hunting conservatives?
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   Oh, all right.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   I don't know.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   Hey, some people hunting people.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   It's some human hunting.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.240]   Some humans hunting other humans for silly reasons, yes.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.640]   Like the running man.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   Yeah, I mean, that's it.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   I have a question.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.800]   There's a lot of movies like that.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.280]   Do you, how do you feel about buying a movie you've never seen before?
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.200]   That's my question.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   I do it all at a time.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   It's just a rental though still.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   I don't think you're still buying it.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   It's a rental.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.080]   And bucks you don't even own it?
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.600]   No, because your ticket price is like $12 to $15.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.240]   And if you're the whole family is going to watch it for $20.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.680]   You have $20, you have 48 hours to watch it.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.000]   I don't think even starts and stops are included.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.600]   But yeah, I know that is a big deal because it's now it's like you've got more skin in
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   the game.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.640]   The great thing about going to the movies is that you're leaving the house and you're
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.480]   seeing it on something larger than a 60 inch screen.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.720]   Although maybe you have, it's great to have an audience of people in which you can actually
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.960]   slap them upside the head if they're making noise during the movie when you don't want
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   them to.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.640]   So there are lots of lots of damage to this.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   Candy.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.560]   You have to make your own popcorn by your own.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.360]   We think that's very good.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.240]   Like DoorDash with their popcorn and hot dogs if you want it.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.600]   Like they can't come to move with the adult DoorDash either.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.960]   Scooter X is reminding me and I meant to mention this.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.320]   I tweeted it earlier.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.200]   Glenn Fleischman, who's of course a longtime tidbits contributor, tidbits no longer publishes
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.360]   that take control books.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.280]   They spun it out.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:44.720]   But he has a free take control book, take control of working from home temporarily.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.760]   So if you, in fact, let me pull this up so I can show it.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.720]   So if you are stuck trying to figure this out, we're lucky because we've been doing this
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.800]   for so long.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.760]   We've figured it all out ourselves.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.760]   But for those of you who are just trying to figure it out for the first time, take control
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.480]   of working from home temporarily.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   Can you see my screen?
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   I don't know.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.000]   Yeah, I guess you can.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   There it is on my screen.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.680]   Take control of working from home temporarily.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.000]   It's free.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.040]   So if you need a little help, a number of people reached out to me saying, hey, could
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   you help us?
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.400]   We're trying to stream religious services.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:29.640]   We had the local Jewish temple, the Khabad in Petaluma, had a 93-year-old Holocaust survivor
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.720]   coming to town on Thursday to do a talk.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.640]   And of course, they weren't allowed to have an audience.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.880]   So they said, they called me and said, could you stream it?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.480]   We were going to stream it, but they fortunately, the 93-year-old woman, having survived the
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.960]   Nazis has decided wisely not to risk the coronavirus.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.160]   So she's headed for home.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.000]   So I think a lot of people are wondering, wow, what are you very interested?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.280]   How is this you do this thing that you do?
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   We've developed a skill.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:10.840]   A lot of people using Zoom, Hangouts Meet is now free, some enterprise features, including
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.680]   meetings for 250 people.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.800]   I think it's an interesting idea to have an office, just everybody in the office join
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.160]   a meet and have it on running all day.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.640]   There's no time limit now either.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.240]   A lot of these services are getting their first, oh my God, stress test.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.960]   I think, wasn't it Microsoft's Meet Service team, sorry, that had problems initially,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.040]   at least dealing with a bandwidth.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.080]   The Metropolitan Opera is one of a lot of different opera hoses and theater companies
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.280]   that are saying, okay, well, guess what?
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.040]   We're opening up our streaming libraries for, we're going to stream for free a different
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.560]   opera every night.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.640]   So the first one was Carmen last night.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   Did you watch that?
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   I actually did.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.040]   I actually already subscribed to the on demand channel.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.760]   And it is a wonderful production, but this is the first time they've had like tens of
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.000]   tens and tens of thousands of people streaming at the same time.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.560]   So it's kind of a good thing that they're learning how to, learning what the limits
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.280]   of their systems are and how to improve them if necessary.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.080]   John Lengen just gave a concert for St. Patrick's Day today.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.480]   The dropkick Murphy's are doing a free concert.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.880]   I know Chris Martin of Coldplay did a concert a couple of days ago.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.240]   You mentioned the Met Berlin Philharmonic is doing streaming concerts.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.560]   In a way, it's, and of course, there's always a double edged sword when these horrible things
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   happen.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.320]   I remember 9/11, but it's always kind of, to me, reassuring to see how people pull together
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.480]   and we're all in to see the Italians singing from their balconies.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.280]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.920]   I think it's a good thing to do a concert, but Laurie so far is undertended.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.400]   Sick burn in my balcony, baby.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.800]   We've been talking about whether or not we could do something on our roof or something.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   Like the Beatles.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.040]   It was funny.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.200]   Pat and Oswald was on his Instagram doing his comedy set from like, from like his front
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   porch to the empty neighborhood.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   How's everybody doing?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.120]   It's interesting because like, hella time, 90 days free for everybody.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.520]   I don't know how their servers will, will keep up.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.120]   I guess you don't have to have the Peloton hardware.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.840]   You could just use it on your iPad and do your own ex, because they do other things
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   besides bike.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840]   I have a Peloton bike.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.000]   I've been using it a lot more.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's great.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You want to exercise.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.880]   You know, you can sit in the house a long time.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.120]   You want to get outside, take walks, you know, and exercise.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.600]   Go get de-stress.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   So this is an opportunity.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.120]   I think people are going to discover a lot of new tools and techniques.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.480]   I'm looking at Microsoft Teams and the number of problems reported in the last 24 hours.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.000]   It is spiking a little bit.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.320]   All of the UK cell providers went down this morning.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Did they?
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   Wow.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   Wow.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.360]   That's what the last thing we can take right now, because like, my isolator already don't
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.720]   take away my electricity.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   I mean, yeah, that's the thing you worry about.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:08.280]   Some big Apple news, we had heard rumors that Apple might be, I think it was Apple
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.000]   Insider had this rumor.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.480]   They have a tipster.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:18.800]   They might be releasing a new product or two, the MacBook Air this week.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.400]   They did that last year, I think they had a series of press releases with new stuff.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:30.600]   And then there was a leak of the Chinese repair manual that showed four new iPads, iPad
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.840]   Pros, both 11 and 12.9 inches.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.000]   That's got to be Wi-Fi and LTE.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Yes, it was.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.280]   Do you think we'll see those this week?
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.880]   Because the other big story is that Apple has closed all its stores.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.400]   Yeah, outside of China.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.860]   I think some of it comes down to how the tipster, which I think it was actually Mac
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.840]   rumors, they were the ones that had the tipster.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.480]   I think it comes down to how much, like when that person got that information compared
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.960]   to what's going on right now.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.680]   Because I think a month ago, somebody could say that and I would say, yeah, that's going
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   to happen.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   I could see that happening.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   That makes sense.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   No, with so many things that have changed and so many reasons why Apple wouldn't release
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   a new product right now, that information might have been true when that person originally
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.720]   received it, but may not be quite as true now.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.560]   So I don't know.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.640]   There's a lot of things up in the air now.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.080]   That's a good observation.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.520]   Because this is one of the great things about not announcing anything before you're actually
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.080]   taking orders for it.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.120]   Because now Apple can simply decide that the money, the money for consumer products like
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.520]   this is not out there.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.480]   We keep telling people that the iPad is great for being out and on the go and nobody's out
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.720]   and on the go.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.040]   China is still ramping up its manufacturing.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:54.000]   So if we decide to delay this until for another couple of months, not only will people now
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.440]   be kind of lustful for actually making big consumer purchases because they've been doing
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.120]   nothing for the past couple of months, but we'll also have a much, much bigger backstock
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   to deal with.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.880]   Yeah, I would be thinking that almost everybody who has the opportunity to not introduce a
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.720]   really expensive product that has nothing to do with like B days.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.160]   If you've got B days, release them because you're going to make a real serious bank this
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.160]   month.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.200]   But otherwise, I could see every company exciting.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.680]   Let's see if we can actually delay this for a couple of months.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.520]   Well, I have a personal investment in this.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.960]   Is that like just for me personally, last year they did one product every week and that
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   was fine.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   That was great.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   I would be very proud of the company.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   I would be proud of the company.

[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   I would be proud of the company.

[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   I would be proud of the company.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   It's a great time to stay out of the classroom and take your courses with ITProTV.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   You do it online.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   You can do it on your computer, on your iPad.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   You can do it on your Roku, your Apple TV, Android, iOS.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   It's everywhere.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   You can start your day, have some breakfast, watch it on the big screen TV, hop in the car,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   listen to it as you drive to, well, not work now, whatever you're going, this grocery store.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   It's just awesome.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   Binge-worthy learning for IT professionals.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   The content is always fresh because the IT world is constantly changing.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   They have six live studios.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   They run them Monday through Friday, nine to five.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   That gives them 4,000 on-demand hours of IT training and new stuff every single day.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   You'll get the latest exam objectives.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   If they're new certs, they'll have them first updated software releases, redesign interfaces and more.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   If you're looking for the certs that almost everybody needs, the CompTIA A+ network plus
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.960]   and security plus certs, you ought to know ITProTV is the official video training partner for CompTIA.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   They have 12 CompTIA on-demand courses, including those big three certs.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   If you are an organization, I want to point this out, that has to cancel a conference
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   or needs to start streaming content. ITProTV is there for you.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   Their facilities are state-of-the-art in Gainesville, Florida.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   They can take your conference online with general sessions, breakout sessions.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   They can have speakers in their studio in Gainesville, but they can also do it as we do it remotely.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   I went over there when they opened that new studio a couple of years ago, and I was blown away.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   It is beautiful and it is state-of-the-art.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   Whether you're studying IT or maybe you need a facility that will help you keep your business going,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   see how ITProTV can work for you.

[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   And by the way, we really thank ITProTV.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   As we hit tough times, a lot of our advertisers are starting to back off saying, "We don't want to advertise."
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   So we really appreciate the advertisers that stick in there so we can continue to pay our staff, keep the lights on, keep the shows going.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   I thank you ITProTV. You've always been a great partner.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   ITProTV.tv/Macbreak, you help us out by using that URL in the code Macbreak30.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960]   Help yourself out too.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.960]   All right, what are those new earbuds you guys is wearing?
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   Those look good.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   They look like the old powerbeats. What's different?
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   So they are the old powerbeats. They're not the powerbeats pro.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   They're the powerbeats for the apples not using the number four.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   They're doing like the new powerbeats, but they have the H1 chip.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   So it's an upgrade from the old W1 chip. I think that was in the previous generation.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   And they were a little water resistant and they've redesigned the cord so that it's a little rounder.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   And they say just better for humanity.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   But I think the sound is the same, but I'll defer to Lori on that because she actually knows what she's talking about.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   She's got golden ears.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   Pick hair and golden ears.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   They have completely updated the sound for the powerbeats for, sorry Renee, but basically the powerbeats for have the same beam forming microphone, the same dynamic sound calibration that the powerbeats pro have.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   So in terms of sound quality, now I haven't literally tested between the two of them, but from the marketing information, your powerbeats pro is going to have the same sound quality.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   The powerbeats for is the same sound quality as the powerbeats pro, which is a significant upgrade in the sound quality over the previous powerbeats and beats headphones.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   So that's a big deal. It's a big bonus.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   They also actually changed the design of the ear hooks and the way that the base of it.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   So it actually looks more like powerbeats pro and there's a slight angle to the base and the ear hook itself doesn't go up and around as high.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   It's more of a like streamlined angled back version.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   And like Renee was saying, there's a rounded cord instead of a flat cord so that it doesn't stick to the back of your sweaty neck.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   So those are the main differences.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   So how much are they?
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   $149.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   Oh, they're less expensive.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   $150.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   They're the AirPods pro.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   Okay.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   $100 less expensive than the powerbeats pro.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   And $50 less expensive than the powerbeats three, which I think is really unusual.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   I'm not sure why they made that decision about the powerbeats three are $199 and powerbeats four or $150.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   And they're completely wireless.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   They're Bluetooth.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   They are completely...
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   Well, you have a wire behind your neck.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   They're not too wireless.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   The sweaty neck.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   They're mostly wireless.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   These are still partially wired.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   You know, we had Marcus Brownlee on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   And I asked him, well, so are you using the Mac Pro?
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   Mac Pros, he said.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   He said, you're using Mac Pro?
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   How many Mac Pros do you have?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   Four Mac Pros.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   Wow.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.960]   It's a different world.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   I was watching his studio tour and he goes by like a bunch of red camera, like one red camera is primarily set up on the robot.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   One red camera is on the overhead.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   One red camera.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   I have to think...
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   He's getting those...
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   I don't think Apple would give him free Mac Pros, but I have to think...
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   No, he said he bought them.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   Yeah, I think the reds he might be getting a deal on.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960]   Let's put it down.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   Oh, Leo, I've realized.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   I see Mark Hazzas studio or I see Peter McKinnon's new studio and it's like one thing.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   And then I see what Alex is doing with Pixar and ILM.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.960]   And it's like billion dollar stuff instead of million dollar stuff.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   And I just...
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   And then you see what we're doing.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   There you go.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   How much of nickel on the dollar, huh?
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   Like remember those LCD backgrounds where they were just for the Mandalorian and I'm like,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   you can just never spend enough money.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   There's all the money to spend.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.960]   No, I really like what Mark has said.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   Because I asked him, "You don't do daily."
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.960]   He said, "Well, we decided..."
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.960]   And it's his tagline.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   We decided to go for quality.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   And so the amount of effort we put into every video, we could only do two a week.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.960]   We couldn't do five a week.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   So he is putting...
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   He's decided to spend the money...
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   A lot of money.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   And I don't think they're, by the way, they're not bottom of the line, Mac Pros.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   I think he said mid-range.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   He spent a lot of money, but that's...
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   Hey, he's making a lot of money.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   And that's the standard that he's set for his stuff.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   So I was pretty impressed.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.960]   And the thing I love about him is he's never content.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.960]   He's always trying to do better.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   Like he has the robot.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   Because there's a lot of YouTubers who got super famous, super early,
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   and have basically made the exact same video for the last ten years.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   And they put out maybe three a year and do the exact same video.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   And then there are others who like...
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.960]   They've been doing it for ten years and they are still pushing it every day.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   And he feels like that's what he wants to do.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.960]   I asked him, "When are you moving in with Logan Paul?"
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   Because I think you really guys...
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   You gotta do a call lab.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   What do they call them?
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   Call lab.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960]   I don't know.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   Yeah, call lab.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   What the kids call them?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   I asked him about smashing the red button and stuff too.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   I want to get some tips from...
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   He's only got ten and a half million followers.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   So, when the stores are closed...
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.960]   You might say, "Well, am I gonna be able to get repairs?"
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   Did you read the...
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   Sort of.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   Sort of.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   Sort of.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   Sort of.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   No.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   It's kind of like you have to sneak in.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   But you could go to the store.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   If you have a product that you had repaired,
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960]   you can go to the store.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.960]   I don't know what they're...
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   Open the door, throw it out at you and close it or I don't know.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   Well, actually, the information said if you go on the 15th or the 16th,
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   I think it was very specific that they were saying as of yesterday,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   you can't take up your devices just by going into the store that there's gonna be.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   My guess is that they'll probably ship it to you, something like that.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   You just won't be able to walk into the store to pick it up.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.960]   But how are you gonna bring it in if you need to repair?
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.960]   Well, then they talk about alternate methods of repair.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.960]   So they're gonna try to do some kind of...
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   My guess when they met by that is try to do some remote helping for you,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   like talking on the phone, maybe accessing your desktop or your phone or something like that
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   in order to try to help you troubleshoot it right there at home.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.960]   Because a lot of times when people have something wrong with their phone,
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.960]   it's just a little thing, a setting they didn't know about,
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   or maybe they need to restart it, or a lot of times it's something that can easily be fixed.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   It's just that we're scared of our technology, so we don't want to do it ourselves.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   And if we have somebody over the phone explaining how to do it,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   then we can kind of walk through that.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   And then my guess is if you've been taken through all the steps of trying to set self-diagnosing
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   and figuring it out through a remote conversation and you still can't figure it out,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   or if it's something like a broken screen or something like that,
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   then Apple will have you ship it to somewhere.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   It'll just take a lot longer.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   You won't be able to just get it done that day or get it done within a day or two,
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   because you'll have to add the time of shipping it out.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   That's my guess, is the way that'll work for now.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   You can't walk into an Apple store and get a repair because they're closed.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   So they're gonna probably try alternate methods like remotely helping you
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   or having you ship it if there's no way they can help you remotely.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   They're also helping to help authorize service providers to stay open by authorizing.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   MacRumors got a memo, got a hold of a memo that says that they're gonna be receiving maximum payouts
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.960]   for qualifying product repairs during March and April,
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   regardless of the shop's monthly performance metrics,
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.960]   to make sure that these facilities can stay open and keep working during,
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.960]   while Apple stores are closed.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   Tim Cook and Eddie Q went to a party,
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   the 60th birthday party for the CEO of Universal Music Group,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.960]   who's on Grange, then he said, "I have the virus.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:53.960]   It's not known if Cook or Q have been tested or if they got sick or what,
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.960]   but they were all at a party with Grange."
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.960]   Grange is currently receiving treatment at the UCLA Medical Center.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.960]   I don't know how ill he is, but that's a little scary.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   But that's something we're all gonna hear.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   Pause for thought, definitely.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   He said he's positive.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.960]   I don't think either of them are in the most vulnerable target group,
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   and they have excellent healthcare options available to them.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   But when I read about that, I wasn't so much worried about their health,
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   because I'm sure they're gonna be perfectly fine.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   I was worried about what analysts and what the stock market is gonna think,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   that, "Ooh, what if this one guy that we have told ourselves
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.960]   is solely responsible for the success of Apple,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   were to be out of the picture for a year or forever,
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   what would happen to them when neither of those things is really,
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   really true or really a problem?"
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   It's just really uncertainty is the biggest,
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   the biggest leverageable factor in all of this.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   It's not the disaster that could possibly happen.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   We'll probably write this out just fine, most of us.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   But it's the uncertainty of not being able to plan for what the market
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   or what the world is gonna look like in six months from now.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   Nobody could have predicted all the industries that would,
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   boy, March Madness, there's nothing that could possibly cancel March Madness.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   There will always be baseball, there will always be,
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   we can absolutely, we're gonna make sure we pre-order all kinds of liquor,
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   all kinds of business stuff we're gonna need to support all the people
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   who are becoming in, and poof, it's gone.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   Apple stock, currently coming back a little bit as much of the stock market is today,
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   but it's off from its 52-week high of 327 bucks a share.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   It's down to 254.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   Do you think maybe you should just bought some while it's low?
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   It's not like Apple's gonna stay down there, right?
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   Maybe, and I was wondering, I haven't looked into it,
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   but I wonder if Apple's been thinking about buying themselves back a little bit
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   because they can buy themselves in a back opportunity.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.960]   They had a pretty good bargain.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   Yeah, they've been doing that.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   Watching the shorts talk about it has been crazy.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   Like, "Can we keep shorting? Can we keep shorting now? Can we keep shorting now?"
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   Oh man, just to erase that train.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   It feels like speculating on suffering.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   Speaking of suffering, if you're an Apple TV plus executive,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   your head, actually all of Hollywood is basically shut down.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   But Apple was shooting in Ireland for their foundation show,
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   the one based on the classic Isaac Asimov.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.960]   They're shutting that down. You had the story, I think, Oliver did.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   A bunch of shows have just ended.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   Like, if they had 22 or 21 episode orders and they were at episode 19 or 20,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   they just shut down.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   No kidding. Just said that's it. It's over.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   Uma Thurman's show, "Suspician" has been halted.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   Fear is a mind-killer, Leo.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   Was it you who showed me the hand-washing chart with that,
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   or was that somebody else?
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   No.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   There's so many of them, though.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   I think we showed it on a twig last Wednesday.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   Yeah, because there's actually a great site where you can take any song there
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   and put it to hand-washing chart.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   But somebody took the fear, the litany of fear, and put it to hand-washing.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.960]   That's okay.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   If you want to say it over and over again, it's good.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   It gives you just the right timing.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   Apple is also helping out a little bit by offering a movie sale
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   on your iTunes store.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   Many bundles from $10 movie starting at $1.00 rentals.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   Batman, you can get all four of the more recent batmans for $20.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.960]   The three hobbits, $20.00, Lord of the Ring, trilogy for $30.00.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   I think this is a time to get that Clint East with Dirty Harry V film,
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.960]   "Bundle You've Been Wanting" for a mere $4.00.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   I have more bunch of people.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   There were a bunch of people saying that Disney and Amazon and Netflix and Apple
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   should just turn everybody on for free.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   But there's a huge amount of cost in the bandwidth and the CDN and just capacity.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.960]   And also they don't own this stuff.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.960]   They own very limited streaming rights to this stuff.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.960]   So it's always easy to say, "Well, Netflix is barely solvent."
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   That's one of the companies that you can legitimately worry about
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   because they don't have ancillary businesses like Apple does
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   to defray the cost of doing all this streaming.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   So I saw a bunch of people just over and over again saying,
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   "Just make it all free."
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   That's really hard because nothing's free.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   Somebody pays and a lot of those services already stretch really thin.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   I wouldn't be surprised if this is Apple's cost, right?
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   Because they still have to pay the studios.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   I bet you have to buy the money.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   They're licensing the shows from the studios.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   They don't have their own studio yet.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   Yeah, go ahead, Laurie.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   And I mean, so why should media companies, for example,
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   just give everything away for free?
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.960]   If the idea is that we will stay home and do, you know,
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   be good citizens and not go out if everybody gives us free entertainment.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   That to me is just sort of a -- that doesn't work.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   You know, like, there's all these companies that need to continue to exist
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.960]   and do what they're doing.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   And just because I have to stay home,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   I am somehow deserving of free things that it's your company's job
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   to be a responsible citizen to society.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   And that means you need to give me all of the stuff for free.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Grocery stores aren't giving away groceries for free.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   And, you know, hospitals aren't giving away healthcare for free.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   Or I guess insurance companies aren't giving away healthcare for free.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   You know, it's a little silly to just say,
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   well, they should just give it all away for free.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   They're doing what they can.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   They're giving us discounts.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   They're putting out movies that are available in theaters.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   They're putting them out as digital for us to watch.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   They're doing a lot to try to help us stay home.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   But that's asking too much, I think, to ask a company
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   and just give everything away.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   That's too much.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.960]   And that's the responsibility, I think, of state government
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   to, at some point, say, okay, guess what?
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   We tried just simply saying, we tried just giving you advisories
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   and that didn't work.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   And then we tried saying, okay, well, now you can't actually go
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   and eat in restaurants and hang out in bars.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   You only do takeout.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.960]   And now thousands and thousands of you are just going to the beach.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   Guess what?
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   We're now doing a quarantine in place order
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   where anybody who is out on the streets,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.960]   we will at least be asking you pointed questions
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.960]   about why you are at this beach and why you're at this park
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   and why you are walking around this place.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   Unfortunately, people don't respond to the lure of,
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   hey, look, you can get the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel for free
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   if you stay home and watch it.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   They respond to a governor that you respect
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   back by actual health professionals
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   who are saying this is the situation that we are ordering
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   all movie theaters closed.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   We are ordering all public gatherings of greater than 25 people
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.960]   to not happen anymore, to be canceled.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   That's the only thing that people respond to.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.960]   So this is the responsibility of government to have to do the things
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.960]   that are going to make them maybe very, very unpopular for a little while.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   It's very difficult.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   But Lori Gill, if we could convince Nintendo
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.960]   to push up the release of animal frauds.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.960]   Oh, don't think I wasn't thinking about that.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   I would love for them to push it up.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   You wouldn't be averse to that.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   Just give it to me four days early.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   Come on, it's coming out so soon.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.960]   It released Star Wars early.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   It released the last Star Wars movie early.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   And Frozen 2?
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   Give me my animal crossing and I will stay home, I promise.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   And New Jersey has a curfew, so you'll always still have something to do.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   Are you in New Jersey now?
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.960]   No, I'm just saying, like, you know, for the people in general.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   Oh, yeah, curfew is wild.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.960]   I mean, that's, I don't even understand the point of a curfew.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.960]   I saw Mark Kez's tweet where he's like, "What was Instagram?"
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   He's like, "I tried to finish this edit before I have to get home."
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   Yeah, he's in Hoboken.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   Crazy.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.960]   Oh, the one thing I was going to add is Apple said that if you are struggling
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   and you don't think you can make your March apple card payment,
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   you can ping them through messages and they will give you them,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.960]   they will not take the payment and they will not charge you interest
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   for the month of March.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   Oh, that's great.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   Yeah, and like Mint Mobile is offering free unlimited data
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.960]   to their customers through April 14th.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   Nice.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   Thank you, Ryan.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   Yeah, so there's lots of, yeah, thank you, Ryan Reynolds.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   There's lots of companies out there that are trying.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   They're doing some things to try to help mitigate our costs of not being able
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   to get paid if we have to take time off or, you know, just keep us at home,
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   So there's companies out there that are really trying without having to just
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   literally give everything away for free.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   There's plenty of ways.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   And, you know, honestly, if you're a landlord to evict somebody at this,
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   you know, and this would be insane.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   It'd just be cold hearted.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   I understand you know, that's your revenue too.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   That's your money.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:55.960]   But I just, yeah, I feel like this is an opportunity for us all to step up.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   Let's take a little break and then some good news, some bad news from Apple,
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   but some good news for us.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   I don't know.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   It's hard.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   More bad news for Apple.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.960]   But first a word from CashFly, who actually quite literally brings you
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   the show when you download any Twitch show, audio or video,
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   whether you subscribe in a podcast client or you download it from our website,
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.960]   you're getting it from CashFly, our CDN, our Content Delivery Network.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.960]   They've been doing it since 1999.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.960]   They saved our bacon back in 2007 or eight.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   When we were desperate, we said, "What are we going to do?"
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   We can't figure out how to get people to show the shows they want to listen to
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   in a timely fashion.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   It was a welcome call when CashFly called and said, "We can help."
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   Now, there's something even better.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   They've just started offering 100% cash shield.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:01.960]   This is cool, a drastic reduction in your data transfer fees with Amazon's S3
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   and other cloud storage origins by increasing your cash hit ratio to 100%.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   Consumers expect 4K content delivered instantly anytime on any device anywhere
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   in the world.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   If you're in the business of delivering content, whether it's a podcast, a movie,
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   an app, a website, you need to get your act together.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.960]   Get that webpage loading or that video without buffering or your game's
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.960]   downloading faster.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   That's what customers expect.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   But you can't do that when your cash items are being evicted for large one-off
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   requests costing you a fortune in data transfer out fees.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   That's where 100% cash shield comes in.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   CashFly's guaranteed availability.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.960]   Now, there's a simple way to avoid this.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   It's next generation content delivery for you today and tomorrow.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.960]   It's dedicated storage just for you.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   You can keep your data and content closer to your customers without the traffic
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   of other companies.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.960]   You can purchase as much space as you need and your data will be fetched right
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   from the 100% cash shield source rather than from your origin.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   Shielding reduces your origin spend by thousands a month guaranteeing no cash
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   misses.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   It'll also, of course, reproves your download speed, no buffering, no waiting.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:22.960]   It's there.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.960]   And they give you guaranteed availability with the highest quality of service
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   because they have servers all over the world.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   You can easily and reliably scale your video streaming to reach a global audience
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.960]   of any size, get hyper-fast download speeds low latency and a scalable solution
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   for gaming.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.960]   And I have to tell you, we've been on CashFly for more than 10 years.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   Petabytes of data every single month go through CashFly.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Not one hiccup, not one.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   If there's a problem, it's our, something we did wrong.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   It's never on CashFly.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   No three o'clock calls.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.960]   The servers are down.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   Nothing.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.960]   It's amazing.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   And do they save us money?
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   They sure do.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:04.960]   CashFly's global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses are delivered
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   five times faster than from the origins you're using.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.960]   Right now you can find out how much CashFly could save you.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   What 100% cash shielded mean to you?
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   A detailed analysis of your CDN bill, your usage trends.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   They smooth it out.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.960]   No peaks.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:20.960]   No valleys.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   So you always bet you know what you're going to pay.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   There's no surprises.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   See if you're overpaying 20% or more for CDN.

[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.960]   Thank you, CashFly.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.960]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.960]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   So supposedly today was the day.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   I wore my green Irish hat because iOS 13.4 was supposed to come out today.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   I've been refreshing a lot.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   Apparently not.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   It would have been 10 a.m.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   It would have been by now.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.960]   It's yeah.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   They do.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   That tends to be right.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   10 a.m. on Tuesdays.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   What happened?
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   That wasn't true.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   It don't.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   It wasn't true.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   There you go.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:13.320]   If you're running the iOS beta and you try to connect to the powerbeats, it says you need
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.480]   to update to the final version.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.360]   The old version is fine.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.880]   But these are sounds like these were anticipating that.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.880]   So maybe the...
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.520]   I would much rather if there's any little like last minute issue, they take a date
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.200]   to fix that and release it and then have to pull it and then have to put out something
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   else.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   Don't rush.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   No point rushing.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   Do you...
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   I wonder...
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.640]   Maybe if somebody's watching knows, are Apple engineers working out of their house?
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.880]   Is that hard to do?
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.320]   I've worked for a long time with offsite developers.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.760]   In fact, our developer now is Patrick's at home in Massachusetts.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.760]   I'm just wondering...
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.880]   I have a feeling there's an issue with...
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.960]   I'm sure that Apple has proprietary software that you can't just access from your home
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   computer.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   Maybe that's right.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.080]   That's kind of VPN hooked up.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.840]   And though I'm sure that they can implement that, that might be a process of getting that
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.000]   implemented onto a computer that somebody can take home.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.400]   Or it may even be location based that they can't...
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.560]   You have to be like within the campus.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.560]   That would be sensible.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.560]   That would be a VPN.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.040]   Because they've got a lot of secrecy.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.680]   But then again, because of what's going on, Apple might have made some changes to allow
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:29.640]   for developers to be able to work from home or engineers to be able to work from home
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:36.040]   because they are all essential, but they don't all have to be on a campus except for that
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.760]   Apple needs that privacy and security.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.840]   So if there's a way that they can expand out that privacy and security and allow the employees
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.640]   to work from home, that would be good.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.560]   I don't know that they are doing that though.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.480]   They might be like, "Well, we need you guys to stay here because we need that privacy and
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   security."
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   I don't know.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:59.600]   I was going to say YouTube sent out an alert to all of its contributors saying that, "Hey,
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:06.840]   we can't have our usual outside contractors screening videos because of security has to
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.520]   be done in a facility where they know exactly what's going to be happening to this content."
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.280]   And so as a result, they're warning them that we're going to be relying way, way, way more
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.640]   on automated algorithms.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:23.200]   So they expect a lot of videos to get blanked for unnecessarily.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.080]   So be sure to let us know if we flag your video for content that is actually not actually
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.080]   there.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.480]   Well, there are also some of their contactors horrific and they don't want it.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.600]   They don't want the employees to want to have it in their house with their families.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.320]   It's really psychologically damaging stuff.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   But the Apple thing is really going to be hard for a lot of the engineers who have to
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.160]   deal with Apple's systems because they are not designed to.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.040]   They are by design, not meant to work from the outside.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.160]   So it's going to be interesting to see how they cope with that.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.320]   There was an article in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:01.560]   I guess I didn't realize this, but Tim Cook told some employees as early as March 6th,
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.880]   11 days ago to work from home as necessary.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:09.720]   The journal reported, they interviewed some of these, they've been having challenges,
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:14.600]   slow download speeds because it's not as fast as the Apple campus.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:21.080]   But mostly Apple's own security infrastructure, which is built to keep outsiders from breaking
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:27.040]   in requires in some cases employees still have to go to the office.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.480]   Because well, there were old stories about employees like just driving into the parking
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.240]   lot, trying to not have to go into their office to take their deaf used device and
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.120]   store the latest internal build on it.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.520]   And you're trying to desperately hoping that the internal Wi-Fi would reach them and the
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.840]   VPN would connect and the phone would update.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.880]   This article is from March 14th in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.680]   Silicon Valley was first to send workers home.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.440]   It's been messy.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.720]   What happens when nearly one million tech employees work from home?
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   I could tell you, you could tell people are working from home.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:00.840]   The traffic has been really normally the Bay Area traffic is a nightmare.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:07.200]   In New York, speeds were mostly empty, which was bizarre to see too.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.460]   In recent days, software developers sent home by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook have
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.720]   complained of slow download speeds and mounting confusion.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.600]   The journal writes, "Over still evolving new internal rules about what work they're
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.560]   allowed to perform.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:26.160]   Some workers can't access crucial internal systems from home to restrict security policies.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.040]   Google had the same problem.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:35.360]   They told their 119,000 Bay Area employees to put in work from home kits of monitors,
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.200]   cables and other technological must-haves put in for to get them."
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:44.680]   Hey, and of course they would provide them, but they've been having a hard time getting
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.680]   them.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.840]   The book, "Recommending employees stay home with feasible.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.480]   Nevertheless required a large block of staffers to remain at the office to press on a certain
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.800]   work like policing videos or images.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.200]   This is much like the YouTube problem."
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.160]   - They're talking horrific as well.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.720]   - Yeah, can you imagine?
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.800]   So it's funny because here we are on the cutting edge of work from home and technology.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.320]   And ironically, they're maybe having more difficult time than others.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:19.200]   But you built your office so that you could do everything, right?
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.160]   Going back to the old radio show?
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:27.480]   - Yeah, so we actually at Twit, yeah, we're in pretty good shape.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.440]   Partly also because of the fires, because I don't know if you remember, but a couple
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.840]   of months ago, our power was out.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.280]   And that was a little bit of a crisis.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:41.200]   And I asked our chief engineer, I tasked Russell with the challenge of how could we have the
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:47.440]   editors work from home, because we have terabytes of assets, graphics and stuff that are here.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.960]   So we've been, since the fires moving stuff to the cloud, and we do have at this time,
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.240]   some editors are actually doing their job at home, but mostly they're remoting into their
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.440]   edit machines here.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:00.240]   That's the easiest way to do it.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.960]   So we aren't yet capable of just completely turning the studio off and continuing to work.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:10.080]   But we've talked about ways that I could bring a switcher package home and we want
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:15.040]   to make a portable package that I could carry with me anywhere if my power is at home as
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.040]   well.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.200]   But right now we're in pretty good shape.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.360]   Yeah, I mean, a few people, most of the people came in, came in because they insisted on
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   it.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.560]   And that's I think a problem in all these companies.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.560]   It's just easier.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.400]   I mean, I'm here.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.960]   I feel like I'm here and it's as safe here as it would be at home and it sure is a lot
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   easier.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   We got all the equipment and gear here.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.160]   I don't have to make my bed like you guys.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:43.440]   There was a meme on Reddit where they had the video production person sitting behind a computer
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.520]   that said normal and then I said, "Quonofirus, exactly, I'm video editors sitting behind
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.520]   the exact same bed.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.160]   It's not a difference."
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.720]   No difference.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:56.080]   Lisa came in, she didn't have to, but she's, I think she's like the captain has to go down
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.960]   with the ship kind of thing.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.560]   She's dressed in a, like on the Titanic, she's on a high silk hat and a white tie.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.440]   She's like, "We shall go down as gentle people."
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   As gentlemen.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.600]   Yeah, we've got the orchestra playing near my God of the E right now.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.880]   So anyway, she could just walk over and play musical chairs with the monitors and we wouldn't
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   be able to stop her.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.520]   She could just swap me in Andy and see me.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   She could.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.560]   There's no one to stop her messing with it.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.320]   The studio, we're just ghosts floating in our little TV boxes.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.320]   Go ahead.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.320]   Go ahead.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.320]   Go ahead.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   Every most.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.560]   Every most are not six feet away from each other.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.640]   I don't know.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.360]   I don't know how you guys have done this for so long.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   I feel like, I feel so true.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:42.520]   It's just so weird knowing that you're in the building, but I've seen the standard like
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.640]   foreshawn of the studio and your head is where it's all he should be, but it's inside
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   a monitor.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.000]   That just sort of like put a little chill through my spine that this is.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.880]   I was kind of hoping they'd put the monitor in the Dr. Evil chair.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.440]   I really was hoping for that.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   Boom.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Boom.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   We have a beautiful coat of him.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   Great.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   At least like tilted.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.340]   Like take a picture of the background and just green screen yourself behind it so it's
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.280]   sort of like blend in.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.920]   Well, as far as I know, I'm not in a green screen right now.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.080]   Actually, I couldn't be anywhere.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.080]   Alex, Lindsey rendering.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080]   We would have no way of knowing.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080]   No way of knowing.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.160]   You'd have no way of knowing.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.840]   That's why we put this big clock here with the date and time.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.680]   Actually, we do that because the chat room insists on it.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.160]   So if you've been hoping that Apple would, I have been, put up a streaming music service,
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.900]   Allah Spotify and Amazon and Google.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.740]   Here's some evidence they may not be planning on that.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.980]   Important financial times that Apple Music has signed its new deals with Sony, Warner
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.140]   and Universal Music Group, the big three to continue to offer those labels.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.180]   Artists work on Apple's service for the years to come.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.820]   Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, Blake Shelton, Mariah Carey.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:01.880]   But according to the financial times, the new deals do not include an economic agreement
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.220]   to bundle Apple Music with the company's television service.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:11.240]   So I mean, there's a streaming service in the sense, I guess there is a Spotify style
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.240]   streaming service.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.700]   I shouldn't say that.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.300]   But there's no Amazon Prime Style bundled.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   A bundled.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.100]   Yeah, that's what I misspoke.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100]   I apologize.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.100]   Apple Plus.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.140]   Apple, Apple Music Plus to go along with.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.660]   We had thought when we first thought that they were going to do the TV thing and we thought
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.780]   maybe there'd be a single one bundle to rule them all.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.780]   That would happen.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:35.780]   I think they're hoping for that too.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.740]   That Apple's in a hard negotiation place because they're still seen as the ones who
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.860]   ended the CD fairly or unfairly.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.100]   And everyone with any sort of digital artistic based IP is just very nervous of Apple in
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.100]   general.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.740]   Yet, that was a good thing for the music industry.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:56.660]   Music industries had the best year they've had in more than 10 years last year.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:01.300]   Turns out that CD wasn't such a money maker.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.100]   It was great for people who printed and trucked CDs.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.100]   Yes.
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:12.340]   But also, it bears, bears working out that they, the music industry essentially made
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.220]   the same deals with everybody that didn't, I think they're more afraid of making a favor
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:20.220]   deal with Apple that they can't match with everybody else.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.540]   And when you're negotiating with Apple, they are really super tough negotiators.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:29.300]   They will find a way to shave one nickel out of a $8,000 per part thing.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.420]   But they definitely don't want to be the people who have to go to their board saying,
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:38.740]   "Yeah, we realize that Apple is one of the most valuable and stable tech companies,
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.260]   corporations in the world.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.260]   But we decided to give them a discount that cut into our profits."
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260]   No, no, no.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   That's not going to happen.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:51.580]   The reason to think Apple was looking at an Apple Prime because they did put a provision
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.940]   like that in the deals with magazine and newspaper publishers.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:01.380]   So it said, "The iPhone maker could bundle the news plus subscription with other paid
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.380]   digital offerings."
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.580]   So clearly, Apple did want to do this.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.180]   But obviously, the music industry have some say in this, as you point out.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.340]   It might, it's all about the negotiation.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:18.380]   I think it took a long time for just Apple music to become a thing because there was
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.100]   a lot of negotiation to be had.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.020]   And that was after streaming services like Spotify existed.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.580]   So I think it might happen.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:34.940]   We might see a bundle like that where it would be TV plus and news plus and Apple music all
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.780]   in one low price thing.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.020]   I think it's just a matter of that negotiation.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.140]   And just like Andy was saying, Apple is going to be a really hard negotiator.
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:49.300]   And so these companies are going to push back a little until there's a final meeting ground
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:54.020]   because Apple music is huge and people are going to join.
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.140]   They're going to jump into a bundled service if they don't, if they're not already paying
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.860]   for things separately.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:06.180]   There will be new subscribers if there's an Apple Prime version out there.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.140]   They'll be people that will say, okay, now it's worth it because I get all this other
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.340]   content for whatever this one low price is.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.300]   So I will now join.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:20.580]   And it's just a matter of convincing the music company that you want to be on this with us
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.620]   because this is going to be big for you.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:27.660]   And now the bad news for Apple segment.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:35.740]   And in another court news, Apple was fined a record $1.2 billion by French antitrust authorities.
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.380]   So kind of boom.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.380]   So kind of bluh.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.820]   Now we're talking some real money.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.540]   Actually, 1.2 billion is a pretty hefty.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.340]   Apple says, we strongly disagree with the decision.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.060]   They're going to appeal.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:54.820]   They said Apple and two wholesalers agreed they colluded in effect not to compete on price
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   and distribution.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:05.820]   They're by sterilizing the wholesale markets for Apple products, creating a cartel, which
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.860]   would also be illegal in the US.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:15.940]   They say tech data and Ingram Micro both of whom were also fined, 76.1 million euros and
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.500]   62.9 million euros respectively.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:26.300]   The total penalty, 1.1 and a quarter billion euros, the largest ever handed down in a single
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   case.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.020]   It's an interesting cycle because this was totally bad.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.180]   But when you look at it, this was under Steve Jobs, I believe it was 2005.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180]   It's a long time ago.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.740]   Yeah, because they don't work with these guys anymore.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:43.020]   It's not that Apple wanted to fix prices so much as Steve, like I've been reading the
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.020]   book, Red in the Past.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.020]   Well, not even sure.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.700]   It's like he just didn't want Apple stuff discounted because he thought it was bad for
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   Apple's brand.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700]   Right.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.700]   He just wanted like, this is a price.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.700]   I'm setting the price.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.420]   Why would you ever want to change the price that I set?
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.420]   Just don't change it.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.780]   Just for a long time, Apple tightly controls the channel.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.260]   You can't get a deal.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.460]   Well, you can kind of know now.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.460]   Thanks to this.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.860]   For a long time, there was no point in searching for a better deal than the Apple store because
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.940]   that's the same price everywhere.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.740]   Unless there were some sort of like, we'll give you a free K-year card.
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.300]   Yeah, once a year student discount or something and you got a gift card and you liked it.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.300]   And you liked it?
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.420]   You took it and I liked it.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.260]   So the French aren't wrong, in other words.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260]   No, but it does.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:26.300]   This is the application there a lot.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.900]   And it's just there's pointing out this.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.580]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:35.260]   I was just going to mention that I think that headline might not be totally correct because
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:41.940]   they've been fined a record 1.2 billion, but they're not having to pay it right now.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:46.820]   I'm fairly certain that Apple's been fined a number that high in the past and they've
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.020]   just appealed and it's kind of dropped down.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.020]   So I don't know about that.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.620]   But there is merit to the case, right?
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.620]   I mean, Apple definitely.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.820]   The point is that this wasn't something that they're not they're not pinging it for behavior
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.140]   from last year or the year before.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.980]   We really are talking about an entire regime ago.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.700]   This was the same time where if you work for Apple and you wanted to work for Google
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.980]   or Facebook, it was just no point because they would they had a handshake agreement
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.380]   at this level that we will not we will not poach people from other companies.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.980]   Steve Jobs moved that was also innovation.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.860]   He wanted things the way he wanted them.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.860]   Even if Steve didn't care what the Unrule was.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.060]   Yeah, no, he didn't care.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.740]   He just said, no, this makes sense to me.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.300]   And this is what we're going to do.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.980]   License plates are for little people.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:40.340]   If you can afford to get a new Mercedes every few months, why not?
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:46.900]   Apple did pay the not would I consider a bad judgment of four hundred fifteen four million
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.220]   dollars to the patent role for net X.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:53.020]   So that money is out the door.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:57.980]   And now every major manufacturer is being sued for I think Ireland for touchscreen technology.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.020]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.300]   So I haven't read that, but I mean, I saw the story, but I haven't read the patent.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.620]   Is that do you think there's merit to that?
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.260]   It's it's one of those it's one of those super thin ones where they didn't actually provide
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.260]   a lot of information.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.340]   I just said that they were being sued for the import of right of technology that infringed
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:19.500]   on the patent for touch screens, basically.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:24.820]   And when I go back to think about the vermin, I can never pronounce it vermin net X.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.020]   It was like, I think that was originally based on fax machine technology that they chose
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.180]   to apply to space time.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.460]   And I remember old Steve Gibson episode, he was talking about someone just being granted
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:39.420]   a patent to display the URL next to the content for the URL, suddenly making every web browser
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.420]   infringing.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.180]   The whole system is well, there's a story.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:50.500]   It's not a max story, but there's a story about a patent role who's trying to freeze
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.580]   COVID-19 tests.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:10:00.180]   It's a company that is owned by SoftBank, who really ought to know better.
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:08.980]   They bought from another sterling company, Theranos, on a fire sale, some patents.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:15.580]   And they have now sued BioFire Diagnostics, one of the few companies making a diagnostic
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:21.460]   test saying they infringe the patent.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:32.180]   And they asked the court to issue an injunction, which would block BioFire from using the tests.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:35.860]   There should be some form of imminent domain for patents where if the good of humanity
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:40.460]   and the nation demands that this thing be put into production and you're just a non-practicing
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.220]   entity, then please sit down.
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.180]   Well, this was a patent lawsuit against all of BioFire's testing technology, not just
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.180]   the COVID-19.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:54.580]   And once Mike Masnick published the story in TechDirt, Labrador said, "Oh, we'll give
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.300]   royalty free licenses for anything for COVID."
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.540]   They didn't want to face that publicity storm.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540]   They're going to take a pain.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:06.660]   And this is really pointing out a lot of stresses in a lot of systems.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.140]   Like where everybody's jumping all over this one guy and the New York Times for price
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.620]   gouging on bottles of hand sanitizers that he's hoarding.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.500]   And nobody's asking, "Yeah, but you know what?
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.540]   What about these drug companies that are price gouging on EpiPens and on insulin and
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.900]   all that sort of things that people need?
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:28.060]   Should we now have controls over how much you should charge for life-saving drugs?"
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.060]   Yes.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:39.140]   Apparently, the next iPhone, the iPhone 12, I guess it's time to start talking about it.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.140]   I mean, here we are.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.140]   It's already March.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   It's only six months away, seven months away.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.140]   Still wait for that iPhone 9.
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.060]   Yeah, and that plus now too, apparently.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.060]   Oh, really?
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.060]   What does the latest reverie?
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.740]   I mean, that makes sense, though.
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:58.100]   They found code in the latest iOS beta that, or I know it was, I think the '14, the iOS
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:02.900]   14 internal build, they found referencing a larger screen size for the iPhone 9 as well.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.180]   I think I figured that's a plus.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:10.900]   The A14, which would be included in the iPhone 12, Kornet Apple and Cider, as fast as the
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:18.020]   iPad Pro, identical in multi-core performance, 50% faster though in single-core performance,
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:22.820]   which I think for most people, that's really what matters, right, is the single-core performance.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.980]   Most of the stuff you do isn't multi-threaded.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.060]   That's because they're seeing stuff on Geekbench.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.780]   This always happens around this time where people who have these new processors and maybe
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.780]   even prototype devices are running Geekbench on them and it goes into the Geekbench database.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   You can see this.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.260]   But I'd be suspicious of that at this point because the people who would have them know
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.260]   how Geekbench works.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.060]   They're not going to run.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:54.340]   I don't do patent stories, but you guys published it, so I'm going to go with it.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:58.220]   The new patent shows the iMac with a built-in projector.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.220]   Really?
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:04.740]   You know, actually, the fun thing about patents are these sort of, like, what-ifs.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.740]   Right.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.980]   You know, most of the time, like 90% of the time, we don't see it within any kind of,
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.580]   like, remember-able thing.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.500]   But I remember there was a slap bracelet patent once a long time ago.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.500]   Right.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.340]   I still talk about it because those things are kind of fun, you know?
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:26.980]   So, some people sitting at a table somewhere in Apple and they came up with the idea for
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.060]   a slap bracelet wearable.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:34.220]   And right now, they've come up with an idea for a projector patent.
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:38.420]   You know, like, somebody sat down and thought about it and came up with enough of a schematic
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.340]   to actually, you know, submit that to a patent office.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:47.460]   So the idea is that you'd see the screen, but then it would extend out beyond onto your
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.460]   wall.
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.660]   It's not like a PowerPoint projector.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.660]   Would it be usable?
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.780]   No, because it wouldn't look as good.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.180]   Would just give you-is it ambience?
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.180]   It's ambience, yeah.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.980]   Or as you say, all the other ones.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.300]   But the other side benefit of this, I mean, they discovered early on that if you publish
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.020]   one patent, everyone knows what you're doing.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.660]   If you publish a thousand patents and one of them is what you're doing, you're protected
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.740]   in case you ever want to do the other stuff, but also it's much harder to figure out the
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:10.740]   one that you're actually doing.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:14.380]   Well, and I'm going to call foul because there might be prior art.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:19.980]   Microsoft showed an Xbox that did very much the same thing and extended your game beyond
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.980]   the TV.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.540]   And we were all very excited.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.980]   They implied that they were going to sell it, but they never did.
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:31.340]   So they might run up against prior art on that one.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.100]   But Lori's exactly right.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.220]   What I wish that Apple could do, I know they can't, but I wish they had the equivalent
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:43.700]   of being able to release or show off ConceptMax, just like at the auto show, they have concept
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:51.220]   cars, designers that are incredibly creative and incredibly forward thinking, but they
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.340]   know that they work for an auto company that cannot make a car, will only sell 500 units
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   or 600 units.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:00.660]   But for the auto show, we're going to actually build a car where the front seats are in the
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:05.100]   back and uses a motorcycle engine on two different wheels because we have this idea
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.700]   of how that would work and how that would work.
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:10.860]   Let's have a turbine engine that we'd have no intention of really making, but wouldn't
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.740]   be interesting to see how that would work out.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:19.700]   If the patents are often a chance to see an Apple engineer who's probably just enjoying
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:24.380]   a burrito during lunch hour, said, you know what, it's done on that.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.380]   Exactly.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.980]   What if we put a pico projector on the back of an eye?
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:28.980]   Cool.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:29.980]   How would I use that?
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   Exactly.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:31.980]   We should do a burrito.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.980]   He's been consuming.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:33.980]   I don't have any cigarettes.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.820]   I don't know if they have a dispensary on the new space.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:41.740]   I like that scene from Avengers Endgame where the Hulk just pats down those two tacos
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:46.380]   and then gives them sympathetically to Ant-Man before walking off.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.500]   I would buy that book though.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.100]   I would buy a book of concept art from Apple.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.820]   Patents that they've put out with.
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:56.060]   As someone who illustrates what that would actually look like, I would definitely buy
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.060]   that book.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.860]   Oh, Johnny, I actually have a nose.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.900]   I'm speculating here because I don't know how it really works.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:07.580]   But if I were a company that could afford to have a building filled with lawyers, one
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.540]   of the things which I'm sure Apple does, one of the things-
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:16.740]   I do, is make sure that one of those lawyers was at every pitch meeting, every product
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.220]   meeting, taking notes.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:23.340]   If anything was said that sounded remotely patentable, these guys were sitting around.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.340]   Patents.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.340]   Exactly what happened.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.340]   That's what happens in all industries.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.100]   Richard Feynman, the physicist, tells a story in his memoir about how he was working at
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:35.260]   Los Alamos early in his career.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.340]   The government person in the patent office on site basically put out memos saying, "If
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.940]   you have any ideas for how nuclear industry could be used, let us know and we'll patent
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.860]   it and we'll patent it in your name."
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.420]   He walked into the office just to tell him how ridiculous this idea because that's just
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.420]   ridiculous.
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.220]   There's like a thousand things he can do with a nuclear reactor.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.220]   That's such a chance.
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.220]   Okay.
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.220]   Nuclear reactor.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.820]   You put it inside a sub.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.300]   Cold water comes in the front.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.300]   Hot water comes in the back.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.300]   Boom, it's a jet.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.620]   Or you put it in the air bubble and like anything's being ridiculous.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.020]   And then two weeks later he gets-
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.340]   Okay, you now have the patents for nuclear powered air, for after nuclear power submarines
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.060]   to nuclear powered boats.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.060]   Yeah, why not?
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.060]   That's interesting.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.220]   Again, you want to patent it.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.900]   You patent everything that seems like it's a good idea.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.020]   Or excuse me, that it's at least a repeatable or a suitable idea.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.700]   I do feel like maybe the patent system is broken a little bit.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.700]   It's a little tiny.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.580]   The question is, is it broken in your favor or the person that you want to hurt state?
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   Right.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   Right.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.820]   Let's take a break and get your picks.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.700]   Ready your picks, my friends.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:40.900]   We are about to get to the final stages of the show in the picks of the week.
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:45.620]   I do want to thank Carson Bonny, our producer, who is working from home.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.620]   Yay.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.620]   We made him.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.340]   And he really wanted to come in.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.860]   I said, no.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.380]   Actually I think he lives in a county that is locked down now.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.540]   So he's probably can't come in.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.060]   A lot of our employees are in those other counties.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.700]   But it's hard, as you might imagine.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.780]   He'd very much like to get his two cents in.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.060]   He begged us to put up a fourth avatar.
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:11.260]   The producer's station.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.180]   So he could be visually there.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.420]   But he is in the chat room and he is in our show notes and he has been adding.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:18.900]   You can put your microphone and a bow tie.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.900]   Yeah, we could.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.100]   Just put a little paint, a little bow tie on it.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.180]   Oh, no Carson Cam today.
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.100]   But thank you, Carson, for doing a great job under difficult to us circumstances.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.380]   Thanks to everybody who's working hard.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:39.340]   We really, I feel like what we do here, besides the day in, day out, informative stuff, the
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:45.940]   tech news, I think right now I always feel like it's important for us to provide the
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.660]   companionship and the information and the entertainment you need to get through a tough
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:50.660]   time.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.940]   And I've been fortunate enough to work in this business so long.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:58.020]   I worked in after the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco.
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:02.860]   I rushed home from the World Series game and went right on the air on K&BR in San Francisco
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.820]   and worked long shifts there.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:11.100]   And I really, it brings home how important the media is in times like this.
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.700]   After 9/11, I was at tech TV.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.060]   We went to a, you know, all news format.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.180]   And I remember working with Erica Hill sitting at the desk reporting horrific stories in
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.660]   Erica, who was from New York City.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:26.300]   It was especially hard for her, but she's such a professional.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.460]   We work through it.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:32.260]   And those times, I remember, of course, our first screensaver's back after 9/11.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.700]   We had a candlelight vigil.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:38.700]   And those times resonate for me because it really brings home.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.980]   A lot of times what we do, it's just fun.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:44.100]   It's, you know, it's kind of disposable.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.860]   But I take seriously our responsibility at times like this.
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.620]   So thank you for watching.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.540]   I hope you'll let us continue to keep you company and we will continue to make the shows.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:57.620]   And we'll do it in a safe and healthy way because we want everybody to be back, you
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.820]   know, so you stay healthy too.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:05.220]   Our show actually today sponsored by HealthIQ, a life insurance agency for people who are
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:06.220]   healthy.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:11.900]   If you take care of yourself, if you work out, if you eat right, you could qualify for
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:17.460]   rates that could save you up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to other
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.460]   providers.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.660]   Now, you have to qualify by taking the LifeIQ quiz.
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:28.060]   They use science and data to secure lower life insurance rates for people like you.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:32.860]   As an example, you get a million dollar insurance policy from $36 a month.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:37.500]   And it's based on your fitness level.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.780]   So the way it starts, they're going to act on your behalf.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.300]   They're an insurance agency.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.420]   They're going to give you concierge, white glove service, walk you through the whole
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:50.420]   process of applying, they're going to get underwritten by one of the top 30 life insurance
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:51.420]   companies.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:56.340]   They work with them all, but they have savings that are unique, exclusive to HealthIQ.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.260]   You can't find anywhere else.
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:05.140]   But to get these rates, you have to qualify and it starts on the website, healthIQ.com/Macbreak.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:10.180]   With a fun quiz, it's the first scientific way to assess your own health literacy.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.900]   It's not, it's a knowledge assessment, not a self assessment.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:19.260]   To put together the nation's top medical health and fitness experts to create the quiz, depending
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:23.180]   on your score there, as well as other related qualifying factors.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:28.540]   And you can provide things like your Apple Watch records, your activity records or your
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.860]   Fitbit records.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:33.700]   You can save up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to other providers.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.380]   There's no commitment.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:40.420]   You'll learn about even more potential opportunities to be rewarded because you're committed to
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.140]   a healthy lifestyle.

[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:21.420]   It is time for my pick of the week, our pick of the week, but I'm going to start because
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.500]   I got an email.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.660]   Do you remember the classic bot toys?
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:28.220]   I think some of you had them.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:33.460]   You know who had them here in our studio was Alex Gumpel.
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.260]   He had a whole set of them.
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:39.500]   There is a new classic bot toy to mark.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.940]   What is it, 19th anniversary of the iPod?
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:45.100]   It was March 14th, it was a 2001.
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:46.460]   The iPod came out.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.580]   It's the iBoy.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:51.220]   It's a retro toy figure from classic bot.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:58.260]   Actually, when he emailed me, he said, "Oh, we're just about to launch this."
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:03.780]   I see they've already, after one day launch, they've passed their goal already.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.940]   Of course, they can't call it an IPO-D.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.300]   It's the iBoy.
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.020]   I should hasten to say it's non-functioning.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.100]   This is an action figure.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.740]   You're not going to put your music on this.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.660]   It's just a little toy you put on your computer.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.860]   It's got bendable arms, poseable arms.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.420]   It's got little ears.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.540]   Oh, you can even tear the stuff off.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.540]   It's all magnetic.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:30.300]   Alex had a great set of these.
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.260]   The classic bots guys do such fun stuff.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.780]   If you're interested in the iBoy, let me see how much it costs.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:40.900]   Philip Lee sent me an email last week.
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.900]   That can't be.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.220]   Oh, it's Hong Kong 560.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.860]   I don't know what that is in American dollars.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.180]   I think it's fairly reasonable.
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.180]   They're really fun.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.580]   They're not super big.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.220]   I don't know if it's the size of an iPod.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.220]   It looks like it is.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220]   There's a seat in it.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.220]   I think it's a little smaller.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   A little smaller.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.220]   It's a little smaller.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.220]   Anyway, I thought it's nice.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.220]   Yeah, look.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   Oh my gosh.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.860]   You already have the classic Mac.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:05.860]   You kind of want them to have a little Fred.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.700]   You're so cute.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.700]   I know.
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:14.700]   Anyway, and I still have a working iPod, so I don't really need it for an iPod, but
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.020]   it is a cute $37 US.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.020]   That's not bad.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020]   It reminds me of BMO.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.980]   Did I get that right?
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:24.100]   Wow, it's been a while since I've seen that show.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.380]   The character from...
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:31.580]   Oh, now I can't even remember the name of the cartoon.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:32.580]   Never mind.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:33.580]   Ignore me.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:34.580]   Never mind.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.580]   Never mind.
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:36.580]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.580]   I see it on the website now.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.580]   $37 for the iBoy Kickstarter special.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.580]   There it is.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:43.580]   Say hello to iBoy.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.580]   So cute.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.580]   It's cute.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.580]   It's cute.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.020]   Laurie Gail, you're pick of the week.
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.580]   Speaking of cute things.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.580]   Me?
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:53.580]   Me?
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.580]   Me?
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:55.580]   No.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.580]   On this Friday, March 20th.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.580]   Yes.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:58.580]   Animal Crossing New Horizons comes up.
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   I know I've talked about it.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.580]   I'm very excited.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.940]   I've talked about it on the relaxing game, a life simulator where you just fish and collect
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:05.940]   fruit.
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.020]   But on the same day, Doom Eternal comes out.
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.820]   It was just a first person shooter game where you're just splatter festing everything inside.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.780]   Oh, you go either way, huh?
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:22.100]   And the gaming community has joyfully made these wonderful memes showing characters from
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:27.520]   the Animal Crossing world mixed with a character from Doom together.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.320]   The juxtaposition of the two of them is quite adorable.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:36.640]   A lot of it is Doom Guy, which is the main bad guy or the Doom Slayer, showing Isabel,
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.520]   which is one of the cute adorable characters in Animal Crossing, how to shoot guns, or
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.320]   maybe it's Isabel coming into her own and just blasting everything away.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.720]   It's pretty fun and pretty adorable.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:55.840]   And if you just want to have a little fun, we have a little collection on iMore, but you
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   can also just search for Animal Crossing, Doom crossover, and you'll find a lot of adorable
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.000]   illustrations and memes and images and videos and everything.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   This is a video.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:07.840]   Oh my God.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.840]   I don't know if I like.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   It's so cute.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.440]   Oh, man.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.040]   It's cute and weird.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.520]   Yeah, it is.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.520]   You will be playing.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:27.240]   I'm thinking you will not be playing Doom Eternal, you will be playing Animal Crossing.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.320]   I mean, after seeing all these memes, I actually do it.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.880]   I might find them all.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.320]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.520]   Two picks, and they're both free and musical.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:45.560]   Joyce DiDonato and Piotr Bixa were supposed to be debuting the Massone Opera Verther at
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.560]   the Met earlier this week.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.480]   Because this is on top of the health risks, on top of the financial hits, there's also
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:59.360]   on lower down on the list, there is the heartbreak of all of these productions on all kinds
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.440]   of different stages that they were all set, they're tech rehearsed, they're ready to go.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:08.800]   Everybody's just like leaping at the gate to debut and boom, cancel.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:14.880]   That was going to see Norma at the Boston Lyric Opera, and they had to cancel the night
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:15.880]   before.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   They were opening night, they were all set.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.080]   This is like in her living room.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.960]   Yeah, so basically they decided that literally in her living room, they set up an iPhone and
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.720]   they streamed it live on Facebook and Instagram, just doing like an hour and a half with their
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.560]   excerpts, including, and these are like world-class talents.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.840]   The fellow at the harp is also like a world-class harpist.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.980]   And so they're singing, they're basically doing like all of their big numbers from
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:46.120]   birther over an hour and a half, and also like sort of kidding around in between because
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.560]   they're just in their living room.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.400]   Oh, that's amazing.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.400]   Oh man.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400]   So, yeah, it's amazing.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.240]   I mean, a chance to see these people who you only see in glittering costumes distantly
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.980]   on the stage with all their makeup on singing, see them in real life.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:01.980]   It's so cool.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.740]   And can I also say, Joy Cidonado is awesome.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:10.900]   Like in her social media and on her YouTube channel, she has such a brightness and such
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:15.180]   a sense of joy and such a sense of optimism and hope that this is going to like, if you're
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:21.060]   in this sort of a sour mood, just watching her just jam to like three or two or two
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:24.100]   hundred year old music is going to make you very, very happy.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.100]   That's really, yeah.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:32.140]   Now, the other free thing that's musical now, I have to caution that I live alone so that
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:38.100]   the fact that that Moog and Korg have made their like music-making synthesizer apps for
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:43.940]   iOS free all week long, I can screw around with this.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.820]   Anybody wanting to kill me?
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:51.860]   So if you're trapped inside a house, maybe with small kids and you want to not hear like
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.860]   electronic synth music made by people who have never made synth music before, maybe
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.060]   you want to keep this in your hip pocket.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:05.540]   But Korg and Moog have decided to make both of their key apps free, I think until Friday.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.260]   So Korg's app is the K-Oscillator.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:12.660]   This is the one where you just have this pad that makes loops just by tracing your finger
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:14.340]   along with it.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:22.980]   The Moog app is a mini-mood model D simulator that works on iOS and excuse me, works on
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.460]   the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.580]   That's a little bit more musical, so maybe that's a little bit safer.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:30.980]   But these are both like kind of expensive apps as iOS apps go.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.900]   The K-Oscillator app goes for like 20 bucks.
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.100]   And again, they're free, free, free all week long.
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:41.340]   There's in-app purchases for the Moog app that you can't get for free.
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:46.140]   But I would definitely remember that after Friday, you still get to keep them for free.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:49.220]   You don't really have until Friday to actually buy them for free.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:50.220]   Wow.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:54.220]   So you don't get the modules on the Korg or the mini-mood, but you at least get the base.
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.220]   All right.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.220]   Right.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.220]   And there are fun things to play with.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:02.020]   I have both of those apps and they are really wonderful like waiting for a train, apps,
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:06.340]   or you thought you want to listen to certain kinds of music.
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:08.220]   But yeah, not only that, it looks good.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:12.020]   I mean, it looks just like, yeah, you got a Moog.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:19.820]   It's just twiddling knobs and switches and the Moog D model D is more fun of the two.
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.580]   That was so cool.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.060]   That's so much fun.
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:24.140]   Oh, I'm thrilled.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:25.700]   This is great.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.540]   Brings back memories from the '70s, doesn't it?
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:33.820]   So watching a movie from 1972 or '74, a lot of what the nesting I'm doing is watching
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.820]   old movies.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.220]   I don't want to watch the modern stuff.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:40.140]   I'm watching a Sean Conner movie called The Anderson Tapes, which is the very first movie.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.580]   Isn't that a great movie?
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:46.780]   One of the very first movies to talk about how we're constantly being surveilled.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.860]   But this isn't the '70s.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:53.020]   So it's like with telephoto lenses and reel-to-reel tape recorders.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.980]   Of course, you know that I'm going to bring up the conversation.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.980]   It's for instance, for a couple of--
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.980]   Classic.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:02.580]   That was the one-- what I love about that, it also shows like a tech show, like a tech
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:07.500]   conference, which is like, here's what they were like in the '70s.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.500]   Anyway.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500]   I got to watch that.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:14.020]   But one of the things they do-- because it's the '70s and it's their showing state-of-the-art
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:18.340]   technology like a camera and an elevator, one of the things they do is whenever they
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.140]   show that, they have a little--
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.020]   It's really annoying.
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.020]   Yep.
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.020]   But I think--
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:29.980]   But I think in the '70s, they thought, oh, this is cool.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.300]   But you can tell it's a mug.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.460]   I mean, it sounds just like that.
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:34.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:39.900]   Not a lot of people could afford mocha synthesizers.
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:40.900]   It was a big deal.
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:44.820]   Almost none of them were Wendy Carlos, however, and knew how to actually use a mocha synthesizer.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:51.180]   Somebody's mentioning before Garrett Morris became a star as the only black guy in "Saturday
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:55.300]   Night Live" for years, he was in that movie as a cop and actually has a great, like,
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:58.500]   Bravura mini role, a little role on there.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.500]   It's really quite good.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.500]   He's very funny.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.980]   I think that leaves but Renee Ritchie for our pick of the week.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:05.980]   Mr. Ritchie?
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:06.980]   Yes, sir.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.460]   So mine is full disclosure.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:12.140]   This was made by a friend of mine, but I still think it is magnificent.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:16.060]   So Dave Whiskis, who some of us know from his previous career, where he was a designer
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:22.660]   and he made the Vesper app with John Gruber and Franz Simmons, he's gone into video now.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:26.340]   And he only makes one video a year.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:32.180]   And this one is a documentary on all the sunglasses and all the Marvel cinematic universe movies.
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:36.700]   And he went out and interviewed the companies like Dita and how they designed the sunglasses
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.780]   and how they get them in front of people like Robert Downey Jr.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:45.980]   And they always pick a celebrity to use as the inspiration for the sunglasses, but they
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:49.220]   never know if the celebrity is actually going to like or use them and how studios are now
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:53.140]   starting to get sunglasses stylists, the way they've had clothing stylists and they deal
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.780]   with the stylists now.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:56.740]   And they don't know if they're actually going to be in a movie.
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:00.340]   So they all show up at the movie theater every time and just to see if some of their work
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.780]   makes it into the final movie.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:09.100]   And it's just it's basically a journey from concept to design to seeing Robert Downey Jr.
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:15.820]   or someone like Spider-Man wearing them for either two seconds or the entire movie.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:22.780]   And it's just gorgeously shot and color graded and titled and scored and all those things.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:26.780]   And especially now when we have a little bit of time on our hands, it's like a 30, 40 minute
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.260]   long documentary.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:35.620]   It's well worth the watch if you like Downey Jr. or Marvel or sunglasses.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.780]   I just love it that you too.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:42.580]   And the technologies, the widespread use of these democratic technologies means that
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:50.820]   you can have a beautiful movie on the most nichey, nerdy, I mean, really sunglasses from
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:51.980]   Marvel movies.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:53.140]   But that's great.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.260]   And if you're a fan, even if you're not, it's fascinating.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.020]   I mean, we even knew this was a thing.
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.900]   And he shot it with a C200 and it was originally it was originally an original on a streaming
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.340]   service, but their exclusivity passed.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.420]   It's always put it up on YouTube for everybody.
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:08.740]   I think that's great.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.740]   That's really cool.
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:10.740]   Yeah, that's a good plug.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:16.180]   You can find it on YouTube, The Secret of the Edith Glasses by Dave Wiskis.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.180]   Even dead.
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.180]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:21.740]   Yeah, really, really cool.
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:22.740]   Even dead, I'm the hero.
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:27.620]   Oh, he has his own streaming service called Nebula, which is on CuriosityStream.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.620]   So let's give that a plug.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.180]   That's another good thing to subscribe to during this.
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:36.860]   Well, basically, if you get CuriosityStream, I forget the details, but if you can, and
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.700]   disclosure, their sponsor of mine too, if you get CuriosityStream, you get Nebula.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:41.700]   Yes.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.300]   And CuriosityStream, like four bucks a month or something, it's cheap.
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.140]   If they were an advertiser for a long time.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.940]   I subscribe to CuriosityStream.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:52.580]   Thanks to Renee's suggestions on his vector videos and I love it.
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:53.580]   It's great.
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.860]   Yeah, $3 a month, $20 a year.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.140]   It's very affordable.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:00.340]   And the cool thing is the Nebula part is educational YouTubers, but you don't have any of the sponsor
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:01.820]   stuff or YouTube ads or anything.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:07.620]   It's just like Thomas Frank and Legal Eagle and all the big Kergasach, all the big YouTubers
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.820]   in there.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:13.740]   So we end the show with news that Sonoma County is now joining the other seven Bay Area Counties
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.060]   with a shelter in place order.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:17.820]   So I'm going to stay here for the next two or three weeks.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:20.380]   I hope you brought some food.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.860]   So what does shelter in place mean?
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:27.860]   It means you can only go out for essential activities like grocery shopping.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:31.060]   You can go to work if your job is an essential job.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:36.540]   So it really kind of forces employers to let employees work at home.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:42.420]   It is the most stringent requirements short of a curfew, which they're doing in New Jersey,
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:45.900]   but is the most stringent requirement yet in place in the United States.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:47.780]   And I think New York City is about to follow.
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:50.540]   I suspect you're going to see it all over the United States.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:54.020]   The blasios said within 48 hours, he expects to be doing that.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.260]   So you can go out.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:36:00.100]   You can walk and I see cars going by and you know, you can go grocery shopping.
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:03.100]   You could theoretically be arrested.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:08.380]   It was against the law to violate it, but they said the police are going to be generous.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.820]   Nobody's going to be thrown in jail.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:16.020]   It would be such a damn shame if we have the Chinese experience and the Italian experience
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:20.300]   to learn from it would be a damn shame if the United States of America decided to just
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:26.220]   ignore all those really horrifyingly hard one lessons and just decided to go about business
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.220]   as usual.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:30.540]   Be horrible if our citizens decided to just go about business as usual.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:32.540]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:41.100]   And so I doubt that any civic representative wants to do it, but if you see people just
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.300]   not anything, but tonight's St. Patrick's Day.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.340]   I mean, today's St. Patrick's Day tonight's the party.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.060]   If you're going to do it, now's the time to do it.
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.820]   Keep people out of those bars.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.460]   Can we all just go outside and sing Danny Boy to predescribe?
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.460]   I like that.
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:54.700]   Get on your balcony.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:56.740]   Six feet away.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:59.500]   You can throw up on a fire hydrant any day of the year.
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:02.140]   Why don't you put it up until June or July?
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.500]   It's like burn Danny Boy.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.180]   John Legend is apparently still up on Instagram.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.380]   Oh, I guess it was one Pacific that he started.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.380]   Okay.
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:13.540]   He's with Chrissy Teigen and they're taking live music requests.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:16.340]   So security now is coming up and we will do it.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.140]   But of course, you could always watch it later on demand if you wanted to go see John
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:22.300]   and Chrissy singing on Instagram.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:26.100]   And I bet you Danny Boy will be one of the song sales sing.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.340]   Lori Gill, thank you so much for being here.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.180]   Lori, of course, is managing editor at iMore.com.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:35.420]   She's on the Twitter @ApaHolic and she joins us every week.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.780]   Her band Sick Burn is around.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.460]   That's how the plane shows.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:41.420]   Yeah, they're out there.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.380]   And so look, you're not doing shows.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.140]   Are you going to do a live stream from your garage?
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.140]   That would be great.
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.140]   You should.
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.660]   Except for we don't all live in the same house.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:52.900]   So then we're still kind of defeating the purpose of not getting together.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.340]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.340]   Thank you so much, Lori.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.340]   Stay safe.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.340]   Stay healthy.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.340]   Same to you, Renee Richie.
[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:05.780]   Of course, you're in the land above us where there is no virus can survive.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.900]   No, it's the heat that stops the virus.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.900]   Oh, shoot.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.700]   I knew there was something wrong with it.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.180]   Anyway, stay safe, stay healthy.
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.180]   iMore.com.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.140]   And you're going to keep doing the vector.
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.500]   I did one this morning on the power beats and hopefully there'll be other more interesting
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.220]   stuff to do later in the week.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.340]   And I'm just saying anytime you show some really cool new technology.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:32.940]   A little, a little mauve right in there.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.940]   Nice.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:34.940]   Very hip.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:35.940]   The forest proceeding.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.340]   The forest proceedings happening three days ago.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.340]   Ooh, that's good.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.340]   That's good.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:45.340]   Andy and I go.
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:49.260]   Now, are you, are you going to do WGBH?
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.300]   Are you going to be going to the library?
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.300]   No.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.340]   The library is shut down for everybody.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:57.780]   And GBA already announced that they're not already told me they're not going to be doing
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.900]   stuff from the library.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.900]   I'm on Friday.
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:06.260]   I'm trying to decide whether I'm going to come into the studio or not.
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:12.180]   Right now in Boston, there are no, there's no order that would prevent me from doing so.
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:18.260]   Also, I have a lot to think about because I do have lots of resources to make sure that
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:22.380]   I do so safely and I don't influence anybody else's health.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:26.860]   However, I do want to proceed with a preponderance of safety.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:31.940]   It would not be, believe it or not, it would not be terribly easy for me to Skype in because
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:35.380]   the studios aren't necessarily primarily set up for that.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.700]   They're used to being able to go wherever they want to go.
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.060]   But I will make the best decision I can.
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:44.220]   Either way, I'll be on, looks like I'll be on on Friday, probably at around 11.30 noon.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:48.700]   Yeah, I've been doing radio from my house and they're pretty understanding.
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:49.700]   You know.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:52.500]   But again, we can do whatever we need to do.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:56.660]   I guess I'm just trying to figure out what the best solution is going to be because it's
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.660]   a hard decision.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:02.660]   It would be easier if I had people at home that I'd be bringing the virus home to.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:07.180]   But it's more like, well, I mean, how many is it's easy to talk yourself into a decision
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:13.900]   that is that you want to make as opposed to what might objectively be the best decision?
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:18.460]   Because I'm telling myself, well, how many, during your commute, how often will you be
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:21.100]   within three or four feet of anybody?
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:24.420]   And you're going to be, you've got plenty of sanitize, you've got plenty of this, plenty
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.420]   of that.
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:28.260]   And again, I'm trying to make sure I'm not going to talk myself into doing something
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.700]   I want to do as opposed to making their choices.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.700]   Sorry.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.740]   Well, stay safe, please.
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:37.660]   Doing my best.
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:38.740]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.740]   You do the same.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:40.740]   Okay, take care of yourself.
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:41.740]   We need you.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.740]   We'll be back here every Tuesday.
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.900]   Come rain or come shine or come COVID-19.
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:47.740]   We do it about 11 a.m.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:48.740]   Pacific.
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:49.740]   That's 2 p.m.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:53.300]   Eastern time 1900 UTC at twit.tv/live.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.340]   You can watch the live stream or listen.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.460]   The chat room is always there.
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.460]   We love our chat room.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:58.460]   IRC.twit.tv.
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:00.860]   We're all keeping each other company in there.
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:02.500]   In fact, that's a good tip too.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:07.500]   You can always head into the chat room if you're feeling lonely or scared or just one
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.740]   little companionship.
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.540]   The chat room runs 24/7.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:16.180]   All you need is a browser, IRC.twit.tv.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:20.500]   If you want to get on-demand versions of the show, we edit them lightly, take out all
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:25.060]   the Moog synthesizer and...
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:29.380]   If you can't get ahold of a slide whistle while you're staying home with your family
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:35.020]   all week.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:38.460]   You can get on-demand versions at the website.
