[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.120]   Here we are the third day of May, and joining us
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.960]   a massive panel put together by this fellow right here,
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.440]   Mr. Andy Ennato of the Chicago Sun
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.720]   Times and the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.280]   He has battled and succeeded in defeating the Hydra,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.240]   the help of Linda Carter.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480]   - Oh no, this is my trophy from a two-day comic con
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.240]   that I worked very, very hard at,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.840]   and I decided that I needed a toy.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.360]   - That's a good trophy.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.200]   - Yes.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.120]   - Actually, this was a gift from a friend of mine
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.280]   who works at DC.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.880]   We said, "I love it."
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.480]   - I feel as though this will just
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.680]   will just up your office nicely,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.760]   and darn if it didn't.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.360]   So when I realized that I failed to reap two,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.040]   I took my iPad digital video connector
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.520]   with me to the con, and then did not put it back here
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.040]   in the broadcast studio, and then realized
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.120]   that about five minutes ago, and said,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.080]   "Ooh, ooh, need visual interest behind me."
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.680]   Otherwise, all I get is that normally the screen
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.080]   that's over your shoulders now is now disabled.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   - Exactly, I don't know that.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.760]   - This is not as cool as having a pile of squirrels
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.400]   courting to be behind me, but perhaps it's good enough.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.680]   And now, believe it or not, there is--
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.040]   (laughs)
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.560]   I'm sorry, there was a groundhog,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.680]   but I swear to God, it's giving me the hairy eyeball
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.920]   from outside my face.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800]   If only we could see it.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920]   But I presume you are recording that, yes?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.080]   - No, because it's like the Today Show,
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   only with wildlife, if this were like a Pixar movie,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.440]   holding up little signs, say, "Hello, now."
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.000]   - Hello, hello.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400]   - I'm sorry, I'm easily distracted.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.920]   I should be sort of making a shit by myself.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.440]   - Andy has patched together in honor of the new IMAX,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.120]   a fantastic panel, just starting with this man,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.920]   the guy that golfers love to take pot shots at,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.480]   or to Adam Engs of tidbits.com.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.000]   - You know, you can't worry too much about the golfers.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.160]   They just don't deal well with moving targets.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.640]   - I love it, Adam, before the show began,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.920]   said golf courses were built just for long distance runners
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.760]   to run around.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.440]   So you can--
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.640]   - I mean, the golfers are just walking slowly, so--
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   - Yeah, why not?
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   - Why not?
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.240]   - If they're walking at all, I mean,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.080]   they're gonna get in the carts half the time.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.800]   - tidbits.com, if you don't already know about it,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.960]   and if you don't know what I know about it,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.480]   I can't understand why you're listening to the show,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.240]   so just stop and read every episode,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.280]   every issue of tidbits from the last 20 years,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.120]   and then you go--
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   - Ooh, that would be scary.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.040]   I mean, every now and then I go back
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   to some of those early issues,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.760]   and it's just painful.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.360]   - Have you ever all put them in one big file
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   and done a word count,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.600]   just to see how many words are in there?
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.280]   - It's all in MySQL, so I don't know.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.120]   We could look--
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.960]   - Fun.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.280]   I'd love to know.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.560]   - Okay, I'll ask Glenn how to do that.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.840]   That's one of those database things that--
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.920]   - But I have to ask about it, I don't know.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.720]   You know, the bar has gotten higher,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.880]   I can't just open everything and beepy at it,
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.320]   and do a search was what I would have done before,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.400]   but now I need to help on the databases.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.480]   - I know the feeling.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.320]   (laughing)
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.960]   That's a price of success, Adam.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.920]   Also joining us from the Breen Mansion,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.080]   just down the road to peace,
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.400]   the editor for Macworld, magazine, Macworld.com,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.520]   the Mac 911 editor, and a good friend, Mr. Chris Breen.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.360]   - How long?
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.600]   - How long has Breen has joined him?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.760]   - Yes, usually the case.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.720]   - I was gonna take Breen out of frame,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.800]   just talking about this,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.200]   because it was getting so much more attention
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.960]   on Twitter this week than I was.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.800]   (laughing)
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.520]   Just to get back at it, I thought I was gonna--
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.080]   - Well, that's smart, 'cause that way,
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.520]   if it's in another screen,
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.040]   your hair could have its own show,
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.680]   like at the same time, so it's not wasting its time
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.000]   with the body Breen has to do.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.280]   - Believe me, it does have its own show,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.640]   and I'm getting sick of it too.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.080]   - I assume it goes off with Del Rumpel's beard, right?
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.160]   - I just hope the name of the show is in hairspray.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.680]   That's all I hope.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.720]   Also joining us from Philadelphia,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.200]   Mr. Mr. Daring Fireball, John Gruber.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.600]   It's Daring Fireball.net, let me change that here
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   on our lower third, although I told .com works as well.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.440]   - It does?
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.960]   - Yeah, there's only one Daring Fireball,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.360]   that's all you need to know.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.600]   - You get both for free.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.680]   (sighing)
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.040]   - Good to have you back again, John,
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.080]   so what a panel, I mean, we filled Skyposaurus with heads,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.240]   and a good time.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.960]   Andy, since you put this esteemed panel together,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.400]   I'm gonna let you drive today,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   but I bet you would like to talk about the new iMacs.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.280]   - Actually, there was an update to that sword game
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.520]   for the iPad, but we can dump this number too.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   (laughing)
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.000]   Also, we wanna talk about Android market share
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.840]   and all this stuff.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.200]   - You know what I love about the new iMacs?
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.800]   One of them, I guess is the high end,
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.080]   one has two Thunderbolt ports.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.800]   - Yeah, baby.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.680]   - So, Tori, more modern, the entire line,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.600]   the bullet point stuff on it is,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.920]   one of the models will have two Thunderbolt ports,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.440]   those are two separate channels
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.000]   so that each one can support a chain of six devices,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.040]   including a monitor, so you can have an iMac
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.400]   with two external displays,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.040]   probably, I don't know, for driving games.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.200]   - Could you, if you really were crazy, have 12 displays?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   - No, I believe it's only one display per chain,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.520]   including the one.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.240]   The only minus though is that people have already
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.320]   been asking about this.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.640]   Previous generation of iMac,
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.800]   you can actually use an HDMI adapter
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.000]   and use the iMac as a display,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.520]   so if you wanted to have a triple duty
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.040]   as your monitor for cable TV or gaming or whatever like that,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.280]   unfortunately, the new ones do not support that feature,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.760]   but I think getting an extra monitor is probably the best.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.720]   - Are you sure about that, Andy?
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.760]   Because someone commented in my article,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   and for a Mac rumors, they'd asked an Apple sales rep
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.760]   and he'd said that the target display mode
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.160]   was still active on the 27 inch.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.640]   - Yeah, but it's only on work over Thunderbolt,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.400]   and so there's no, I don't think there's any computer
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.760]   that you can use to be the client for that yet.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.600]   - Well, I imagine--
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.000]   - And Gadget has a picture of--
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.680]   - And Gadget has a picture of--
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.280]   - Also, to answer your question, Adam,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.000]   I asked the mothership directly about--
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.840]   - Okay.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.680]   - Our going to say that.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.680]   (laughing)
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.520]   - Just conflicting information.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.080]   - Well, then explain to me then why I'm just looking
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.560]   at the front page of Engadget,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.520]   and they've got the new iMac with dual 30 inch displays.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.200]   - How would you do that?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.280]   - That's just connecting two to the mini display port,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.640]   to the Thunderbolt ports.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.920]   - Oh, okay.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.080]   - The trick is using the iMac as a monitor.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.920]   - Right.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   - Yeah, 'cause this is--
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.160]   - Which was-- - This is in rather than out,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.880]   is the tough thing right now,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.800]   and what they're suggesting is,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.600]   there currently isn't a cable that does that,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.920]   that you have to wait until you have your Thunderbolt,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.160]   bolt cables, and then compatible devices,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.240]   and then you can do it,
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.560]   but right now it doesn't work through display port.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.440]   - Wait, I'll double check my email.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.840]   They said, I believe they said explicitly to me
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.640]   that you will not be able to use the new iMac as a monitor.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.480]   - So-- - It will support
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.640]   external monitors, obviously,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.000]   but you can't plug it into your Xbox or your cable box.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.920]   - Oh, I see, it's out, not in, I get that, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.520]   But this is a 27 inch with extended desktop,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.000]   two 30s, one left, one right,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.160]   and the EN is in the left, the Gatch is in the middle,
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.840]   and the Ett is in the right.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.440]   I mean, that's pretty sweet.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.520]   I think that's a lot of real estate.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.760]   - It's a really big font.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   - It's 11 million, 878,400 pixels.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   - It's interesting, it's interesting,
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.960]   where they've certainly now chopped off
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.360]   one of the reasons why people might go for a Mac Pro
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.920]   instead of an all-in-one,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.800]   because people want that kind of expandability.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.280]   There are people who need those, that many displays,
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.840]   but now that you've knocked that off,
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.320]   now it has super high speed data,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.200]   so that's another thing you would not need a card for a Mac Pro.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.400]   So, and also now that you can get an i7 processor on,
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.440]   but at least one of these models.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.400]   So, interesting to see who's gonna be still left over
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.360]   to buy Mac Pros, now that this is online.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.440]   - Well, if you needed to put a slot,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.120]   Blackmagic Card in as we do,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.480]   if a lot of higher-end editors and stuff,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480]   I think would still--
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.680]   - Yeah, Mac Pro is really moving up in terms of who needs it.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.080]   I mean, I always used to buy the Mac Pro or the PowerMax,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   and use this for extra monitors.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.320]   But now that it's, the iMac and the Mac Mini
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.760]   can all drive double monitors,
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.800]   and the iMac is getting really, really powerful.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.600]   It's getting harder and harder to think about
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.720]   what that next desktop Mac will be.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.200]   If it's, you know, Mac Pro,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.840]   you just have a hard time justifying the cost.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.160]   - Well, I think it's still audio and video professionals.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   If you're using a full-blown Pro tool system,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.000]   for example, you need those slots.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.280]   If you need really high-end video cards,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   yeah, possibly you may need to do it for that too,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.720]   or certain kinds of video editing.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.560]   - Right.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.120]   - The question is, especially for audio devices,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.920]   which you are definitely the god of in this group,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.760]   it will thunderbolt have the sort of bandwidth to
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.880]   make it the attractive choice for those,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.520]   for a new generation of those sound devices,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.800]   or are people still gonna need a card in a slot
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.320]   in order to make that work?
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.200]   - Well, it certainly could be that you're gonna be able
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.720]   to use this for audio in a lot of applications.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.600]   Currently, what a lot of these things do is that they serve
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.360]   as they do a lot of processing on the board,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.640]   rather than leaving it to the Mac itself.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.040]   So if you're using a Pro tool system, for example,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.240]   it does a lot of processing on that card
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   and then sends it out to the main hardware unit.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   So for that reason, you still need these cards.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.160]   I think it certainly rejigger the system and say,
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.480]   no, we're gonna do it the processing on the Mac,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.840]   or we're gonna use thunderbolt to get through
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.120]   to these audio units.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.720]   - Yeah, 'cause these new processors just don't have
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.000]   the performance, right?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.360]   - Oh man.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.160]   And not to mention the high end GPU,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.960]   you're finally getting in there.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   There's a lot of horsepower, even in the SiMac.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.040]   I think the only reason not to get an iMac at this point
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.560]   is if you don't want an all-in-one unit,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.840]   I mean, my son's iMac failed, a hard drive failed,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.360]   I gotta schlep the whole thing in.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.960]   I can't pop the drive, put a new one in that kind of thing.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.320]   - Here's the other thing that bugs me is,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   I've been using double monitors on my Mac since 1991.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.440]   And at this point, I like matched monitors.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   - Yes.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.760]   - And so that's one reason why at the Mac Pro.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.200]   - Well, what if you got a 27?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.760]   If you got, oh, it still was matched with it.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.200]   - Yeah, but see, here's the thing.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.560]   And it's hard to find the pictures of this,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.720]   but the iMac has that strip at the bottom,
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.800]   and the 27 doesn't.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.160]   So even if you can put them side by side,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.880]   yeah, we kinda look in that Engadget thing.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.280]   You've got that bit at the bottom.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.960]   So even if you put a 27 side by side,
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.480]   you're not actually matching your monitors,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.400]   because the size may be the same,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.720]   but the physical dimensions are not gonna match up.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.000]   - Are you kind of OCD a little bit?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.840]   - Yeah.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.720]   (both laughing)
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.600]   - Well, I mean, there's a reason why
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.880]   the Take Control authors list is called Control Freaks.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.280]   (both laughing)
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.080]   - I think there's some people who wouldn't bother.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.360]   I go out, it bothers me, I'm with you, Adam.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.240]   I go out in our office here, and we've got,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.560]   in fact, even the editor's upstairs,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.440]   it's such a hodgepodge of, you know,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.240]   Dell and Mac and different, you know,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.160]   and nobody's complained to me anyway.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.800]   - Because I'm scared that he has.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.480]   - There's a great icon designer, and he's been using dual displays
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.840]   for years and years and years,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.600]   but his policy, and he started this,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.760]   I don't know, five, six years ago,
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.160]   is if he has to replace a monitor,
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.880]   he replaces both and gets them at the exact same,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.240]   two of the same model, start the same date.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.080]   - Like tires.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.880]   - Because they ate, over time, the colors start to fade
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.040]   and whatever, and it drives him baddie
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.200]   if this shade of RGB on this one
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.440]   doesn't look exactly the same as on the other one.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.080]   So he never runs one without the other,
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.680]   runs in the same number of hours, starting from the same day,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.400]   and once he gets to the point where it looks like one's
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   getting different than the other,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.960]   then he sells them and replaces them both.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.360]   - I'm seeming more and more relaxed all the time.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.440]   - There's more money in icons than I really thought, I guess.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.560]   (laughing)
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.400]   - Wow, it's all in volume when you're only drawing
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.800]   32 pixels with each contract.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.280]   Boy, you can just crank those things out.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.640]   - Yeah, the price per pixel is high.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.280]   (laughing)
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.520]   - And you wanna make sure that you move your monitor,
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.160]   the one on the right every six months,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   rotate on the left.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.600]   - Yeah, yeah, rotate your monitor.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.360]   You don't want monitor wear, uneven monitor.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.120]   - No, absolutely not, 'cause the edge pixels
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.960]   get worn out.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   - You know, that's actually, it's not so much,
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.560]   no, I have to disagree, Chris, it's not moving the monitor.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.200]   You gotta move the menu bar from the left one
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.480]   to the right one and back again,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.720]   because otherwise your neck gets kind of messed up.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.280]   You're looking too much to the left, looking too much to the right.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.960]   That's the, it's more of an ergonomics issue.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.600]   - Mm, the trouble, I feel so bad for people
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.320]   with dual 27 inch displays, it must be so hard
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.800]   to live in that world.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.280]   - It's getting hard to find desks that hold the damn thing.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.000]   (laughing)
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.480]   - Yeah, you need a bigger desk.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   (laughing)
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.320]   By the way, it is.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.760]   - I can 24s, that's as big as I can go.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.320]   - I don't know, you can't really see it all,
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.880]   but I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.480]   I've got 11 monitors on this desk.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.920]   This is a nice, it's a big desk.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.320]   - And that's why you're so tan, man.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.880]   (laughing)
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.240]   - I hate, it's not Donald Trump's style bronzer,
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.520]   that's our key thing.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.920]   - I have my liver removed and replaced,
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.680]   but other than that, it's great.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.000]   But, you know, hey, the good news is
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.800]   I'll never reproduce again.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.920]   So, and if you've got teenagers, you know what I mean.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.240]   So, anything else to say besides the,
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.600]   I like it because Apple's really committed
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.520]   to the Thunderbolt now.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.640]   There's no turning back.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.480]   This, this.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.000]   - It really gets you kind of excited
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.440]   for whatever MacBook Air update is gonna come up.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.160]   Because, there's been a really interesting sort of
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.000]   through line over the past four or five months.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.680]   I've talked to so many people who,
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.520]   when it came time to upgrade their MacBooks,
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.240]   people that I never thought in a million years
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.480]   would go for a lower power CPU are going
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.880]   for the 13 inch Air.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.920]   And people who still went for a regular MacBook
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.760]   said, I just need high speed data only.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.360]   If only this thing had USB three
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.560]   or had Firewire in some way,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.480]   I would totally have gone for it.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.440]   Air with one single Thunderbolt port
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.280]   would totally upset the balance of power in the Apple Store.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.640]   - Hmm, interesting.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.000]   Maybe there's something they don't wanna do.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   - There is one really odd little thing
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.200]   about the new iMacs too.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.960]   As far as we can tell from the spec page,
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.280]   they're upgradeable to 16 gig of RAM.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.360]   And yet from the Apple Store, the 21 and a half inch models
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.640]   can up the upgraded only to eight gigabytes.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.000]   All right, don't know why.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.840]   It's strange.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.040]   And I mean, I'm assuming the spec page is saying
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.840]   that they can both be upgraded to 16 gig.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.680]   It's hard to know.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.080]   - You know, they only have two RAM slots.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.440]   Maybe the issue is how much RAM you can get.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.880]   And I thought then on these, maybe I have them wrong.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.720]   Are these Sandy Bridge or what parts are they in this?
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.880]   - They're on Samurai.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.120]   - Samurai five, Samurai seven.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.400]   I'm really surprised that they're not going i7
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.000]   all the way across the board or just saving the i5
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.400]   for the entry level one.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.160]   Adam's right, there's some really interesting quirks
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.600]   in the product matrix.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.680]   One thing that really caught my eye is that they're
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.960]   introducing their first, I think this,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   where you're always able to get an SSD on the iMac as a BTO.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.760]   - No, I was trying to say that.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.840]   - So this is the first time they're saying,
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.280]   and they're making a build.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.160]   - And as a secondary drive.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.360]   - Yeah, and it just seems,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   I think that that might be sort of a nod towards
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.680]   what we can expect in Lion.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.600]   'Cause they're making a lot of changes to,
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.440]   like to try to reduce startup times and reduce wake times.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.440]   So perhaps that's part of that.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.080]   That's not going to be necessarily part
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.480]   of every single Mac in the future,
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.200]   but it makes me think that there's going to be
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.520]   really good infrastructure inside Lion to say,
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.920]   well, if you do have an SSD drive,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.360]   we're gonna use this extra technique.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.160]   So that really if they hear,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.000]   if your microphone hears anybody breathing in the room
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.680]   in one minute and a second after that,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.320]   it's gonna be, you're gonna be fully up and ready to go.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.160]   - This is sweet.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.840]   So you can add, it comes with a terabyte serial ATA,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.800]   you know, spinning drive.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.400]   You can add a 256 gig drive, a solid straight drive.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.160]   Presumably the boot drive for 600 bucks.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.960]   That's a nice combo.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   - It is the boot drive.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.880]   If you expand the bit about the drives there,
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.240]   they say explicitly the SSD will be formatted
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.520]   as the boot drive to get both.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   - Yeah.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   That's the way you want it.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.200]   Makes sense in the way.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.040]   - Makes sense in the way.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.200]   Then you can, it says, you can use the hard drive
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.680]   for videos, photos and other files.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.920]   - You know that big stuff.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.120]   - Well, 256 gigs more than enough for,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.680]   at least in my experience using an air
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.920]   for the operating system and all the apps I use.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.200]   It'd be very hard to get the even two 2-2.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.240]   - Oh yeah, I'm running on a 256 gig SSD
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.880]   and it's no having no troubles at all.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.880]   This is great.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880]   - I can't speak in line.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.960]   I think it's interesting.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.440]   This is the first time they're offering
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.200]   the Magic Trackpad as an option
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   instead of getting a Magic Mouse and it's for free.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.800]   So if you decided that you really want to go with touch
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.680]   and that's certainly going to be a big part of Lion,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.160]   you can do that and say, no, I don't want a mouse anymore.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.000]   I just want to go with the track.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.760]   - I'd buy anything besides a Magic Mouse, to be honest.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.960]   I'd take a used tire.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.400]   I don't know, maybe it's just me.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.240]   - How does that work?
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.080]   - Unfortunately, unfortunately, I'm fortunate
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.240]   to only ADP.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.360]   - Every mouse, every time I get a Magic Mouse,
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.160]   it's just like, I have a drawer full of Magic Houses.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.560]   I don't know why that's,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.160]   does anybody find that magical John, you must.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.080]   - Oh, I haven't used an Apple branded mouse.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.520]   - They're just horrible.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.800]   They're horrible.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.680]   - The last time I used one,
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.120]   it was still plugged in by ADB.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.560]   - Right, you couldn't, there was no choice.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.440]   I have that one here.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.800]   We've been hanging it by its tail,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.880]   just trying to get its secrets out.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.480]   - I won't take it down.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.840]   It still hasn't talked.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.680]   So that's interesting though.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.080]   Yeah, you can get the trackpad.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.120]   Is there anybody who would recommend the trackpad
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.880]   over the mouse?
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.440]   - You know, I have to say that,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.920]   if I were starting with a Mac now
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.560]   and expecting to be moving to Lion,
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.040]   I would probably go for the trackpad
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.960]   and try to really train myself to the gestures.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.080]   Just so much experience,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.960]   it's been hard for me to really do any of the gestures
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.280]   other than two fingerned scrolling on my MacBook.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.640]   And so I, but I do believe that gestures
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.800]   are going to be more and more of a big deal
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.720]   and going to be more and more important
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.200]   for using into the system.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.480]   - So I've maxed this iMac out.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.040]   I put the i7 3.4.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.640]   I put a gig of, I'm sorry, 16 gigs of RAM in it,
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.800]   which is the max even on the high end.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.320]   I put the Terabyte drive plus the 256 gig hard drive.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.680]   I'm not, well, I'll max it out.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.000]   150 bucks more. - Oh, but it's two terabytes.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.840]   - Why not?
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.200]   - It's in 718.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.880]   - Should I get the 6970, two gigabyte GDDR?
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.720]   - Yes, of course.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.680]   - It's only 100 bucks.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.920]   - It's only 100 bucks.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.880]   That's what they get. It's only 100 bucks.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.240]   Okay, but, and there we go.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.000]   Now it's only 36, we are in Mac Pro territory big time,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.800]   big, big, big, big time.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.640]   Wow.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.520]   And by the way, note the date ships in four to six weeks.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.800]   Now most of this stuff is available now.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.040]   I don't know if it's the processor.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040]   - It's the SSD.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.880]   - It's the SSD.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.440]   - Take the SSD off and see if that changes it.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.880]   - Let's see if that changes it.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.960]   One to three business days.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.800]   - Yeah.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.640]   - That's real questions.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.000]   Like what is it taking them four to six weeks to get SSDs in?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.200]   - Just don't know.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.560]   - Maybe a shortage out of Japan.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.400]   I don't know.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.640]   That's interesting.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.240]   - Apple claimed in that analyst call though,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.400]   didn't they that they had no shortages
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.480]   that were related to Japan?
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.200]   - Well, people are, I mean, I don't know.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.040]   I can get my ass.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.280]   - The Q2, I think the Q2 analyst call
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.480]   for final results, they said that there were no shortages there.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.720]   - Because Apple spent a lot of money getting all the parts
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.040]   and early.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:30.200]   I should add the 27 inch monitor just to make it complete.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   - Just get, yeah.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.040]   - One or two.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.800]   - Two.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640]   - Two.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.720]   (laughing)
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.640]   - Now that I know I could do two.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.800]   - There are five people on the show.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.480]   - Oh yeah, each of you need your own.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480]   Each of you need your own.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.520]   - Yeah, my shipping address.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.320]   - What, you know, I'm gonna buy the Apple remote
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.760]   and the Apple battery charger just 'cause I can.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   I don't know why that's.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   - Okay.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.520]   - I'd say now if only we could use that crime kit
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.140]   to do the web inject form, the form grabbing
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.320]   and have it redirected.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.040]   Send that to Zagreb, he's stacked.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.440]   Now you also wanna make sure that you order Aputure
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.280]   for 199 bucks, even though on the store, it's 79.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.760]   - Oh no, really?
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.600]   - Yeah.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.440]   - Check it out.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.240]   - For 199 bucks, you're right.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.160]   - Yeah.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.040]   - That's kind of an expensive cardboard.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.200]   - That's a hundred and 19 dollars
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.720]   just 'cause you don't know enough to.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.520]   - That's the stupid tax, yeah.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.640]   - Boy is that.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.240]   - Well that has to be an inventory problem, doesn't it?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.760]   Where if they already have that as existing inventory,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.320]   they can't discount it without taking a tax or something?
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.080]   - Oh man.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.240]   - I'm sure it's something like that, but that's-
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.560]   - Well you know what else it is too though?
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.160]   It might be that this is one of those areas
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.320]   where even Apple's gonna struggle
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.120]   with the transition to the Mac App Store,
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.520]   where it's like exactly what you just said, Leo,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.160]   where you're configuring this thing.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.240]   You're already up at two grand, 2,500, something like that.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.200]   And you start going a little loose with the,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.280]   well it's only an extra hundred bucks for this,
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.520]   an extra 150.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.200]   I mean it's true, that's just, you know,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.920]   sales psychology that once you're spending 2,500,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.200]   you're a lot more likely to throw in an extra hundred
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.560]   than you normally would be.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.400]   - Pretty sweet.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.240]   - And I don't know how they,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   if they only sold it through the App Store,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.440]   I'm not quite sure how they connect that to that,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.480]   you know, the store.apple.com shopping experience.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   - But come on, really?
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.040]   - Oh it's just a big database, come on,
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.640]   they gotta be able to connect it in the back end.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.920]   - If you accidentally, I do think that the price should match.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.520]   I mean it's, or be very, very close.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.360]   It's criminal.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.400]   - If you accidentally did this and then you got it,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.920]   and then somebody said, "Dude, you're a moron,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.760]   "I think I'd be pretty irate."
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.360]   - It's, dude, you paid a hundred.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.880]   - Dude, dude, you should've got it down.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.400]   (laughing)
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.120]   - And I'm sure Dell does the same exact thing.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.960]   It's, yeah, you're right,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.040]   this is the growing pains that the App Store brings around.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.120]   So how soon should I buy thinking,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.800]   is it silly for somebody to buy thinking
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.120]   a lion is just around the corner,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.840]   how far before we get lion?
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.520]   - This fall?
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.360]   - I think, September.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.680]   - I think fall.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.520]   I don't think we're gonna,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.240]   I don't think we're gonna see it until we get into
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.880]   at least the end of the summer.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.720]   I'd be really shocked if we saw it anytime before August.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   I'm surprised how many people are asking me that.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.360]   They're willing to delay the purchase
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.800]   of an entire $2,000 computer because they might have
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.600]   to spend an extra, we'll work out to $80
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.320]   to upgrade the OS later on.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.760]   And I'm like, "Dude, for seven months,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.880]   "you could be using a brand new Ironman."
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.720]   - That's crazy.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.160]   - Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.480]   - Well, it's only three or four months.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.760]   The other issue is I suspect lion.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   You think lion will be $129 or it'll be $30 or maybe even free?
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.680]   - Not free.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.520]   - Not free?
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.080]   - I would look for it to be less than 100
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.160]   because this is such a,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.280]   this is gonna be one of those upgrades
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.200]   where Apple will really want everybody to have it.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.920]   So because of ads so much infrastructure
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.360]   that's gonna be required for future apps,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.120]   so I think they're gonna try to make the hit as painless.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.960]   - Let's go around the horn.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.600]   Chris Breen, how much will lion be?
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.400]   - Uh, $79.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.000]   $79 from Chris Breen.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.880]   I had Mr. Andy Naco, your prediction.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.120]   - I kinda wish I were going last so that like on price is right,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.520]   I could just like overbend everyone in my phone.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.640]   - Sorry, I will say no.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.400]   - I am going clockwise, clockwise.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   Go ahead.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.000]   - Either 49 or 99, if I could pick one, I'll say 99.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.320]   - 49 or 99.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.680]   That's a big split.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.280]   I can't get it either 'cause I think they're either gonna go
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.040]   for make it so cheap that everybody will want to go for it.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.360]   And if they don't go for that price,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.320]   they're gonna say, well, 99 is still the psychological
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.920]   $1 less than a three digit number,
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.480]   and that's how they're gonna go with it.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   That's just my guess.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   - Chris Breen, Chris Grouber, John Grouber, what is your
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.640]   what is your prediction, my friend?
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.800]   - I'm gonna say $39.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   - $39.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   - I'm gonna say $79.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   - I think that they're committed,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.000]   I think that it's the whole app store thing
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.760]   and sort of committed Apple to significantly lower prices
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.600]   than the old days.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.440]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.280]   - And then we're all gonna be like,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.920]   I remember when you paid $129.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.720]   - Remember when Final Cut was thousands of dollars?
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.560]   - And the only thing new is that they took
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.360]   some of the stripes off the windows.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.200]   (laughing)
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.720]   - And it came on cassette tapes
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.560]   and if you couldn't find the cameras,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.480]   you had a nice idea.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.320]   - Mm, mm, mm, mm.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.520]   - Let's finally add a mankst, your price for a lion.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.280]   - Okay, well, I'm gonna go do two prices
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.720]   because I'm gonna say that there's gonna be
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.440]   a Mac App Store price, which will be $29.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.720]   And I believe there is going to have to be
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.280]   some sort of retail box price, which will be more expensive
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.520]   and I'm gonna call that one 39.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.800]   - And that'll be the family pack.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.320]   - No, that's where's the family pack,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   but there's gonna have to be some option for a DVD
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.400]   for people who simply do not have an internet connection
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.880]   capable of downloading lion.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.680]   - But could you do, is it possible,
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.800]   do you think to do an OS upgrade in the App Store?
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.440]   - That seems like a pretty big deal.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   - That's the hell of a downloader's thing.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.400]   - Well, even if, well, how many gigs for Xcode,
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.280]   that's a five gig, four gig download.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.000]   - No, it's technically possible
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.160]   because the developer betters are going through the App Store.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.000]   - Well, they are.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.160]   - The developer figures are going through the App Store,
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.000]   they're doing it.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.040]   - So there's existence proof that it's possible.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.160]   Now whether that would scale to the millions of people
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.320]   who would be downloading it, you know, I'm not sure about.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.520]   - Wouldn't that be funny if that's why
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.000]   they built a North Carolina data center?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.360]   It's gonna save everything.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.000]   - We built it for lion.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.960]   - Yeah, for two months, then they take it down
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.360]   because as well everybody's got it.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.200]   - Yeah, we built it.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   - Yeah, and it's done.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.880]   - I'm, okay, my prediction, $9.99.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.680]   I'm gonna go on record right now.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.520]   - Nine.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.360]   - 99.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.280]   - And listeners, if it's for every dollar
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   that's more expensive than that,
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.240]   Leo will refund to you 50 cents.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.360]   - I will.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.400]   I'm gonna make you your fury with this
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.240]   when it's not 10 bucks and rather is 50.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.560]   And now we can hold the anchor because it's done.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.000]   - There's no reason for Apple not to,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.840]   I mean, the truth is zero to 129.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.680]   It probably doesn't make that much difference to Apple.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.320]   - Yeah, it seems to me at this point that Apple really,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.440]   I mean, look at what they've done
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.520]   with the prices of aperture and iPhoto
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.600]   and all of those kinds of things.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.480]   They're clearly saying software helps sales of hardware,
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.440]   much more so even than they did in the past.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.320]   And so I don't see any reason why they're gonna try
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.720]   to be nickel and dining a whole lot of people
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.280]   which will leave months no leopard
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.840]   and best leave them behind technology wise.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.640]   - All right, well, there you have it.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.320]   - And I'll echo Andy's, I think Andy nailed it
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.800]   where their number one thing that Apple is thinking
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.240]   about lion is how do we get as many Mac users online
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   as soon as possible?
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.880]   - That's why I think I'm 99.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.720]   Get it out there.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.560]   - A long list of reasons.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.040]   But yeah, that's why I think lower.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.680]   - Yeah, get it out there because,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.000]   I mean, the same thing with snow leopard, right?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.800]   They really want people to move to those new technologies
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.360]   'cause it enhances everything.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:49.160]   And I wonder how many operating system upgrades they sell,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.000]   really?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.840]   - Lots. - Lots?
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.680]   - Lots.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.120]   - Yeah, it's a big grotto with it.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.160]   - It's a big profit center.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.000]   - Okay.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.800]   - Well, it's lots, but keep in mind,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.600]   whenever you look at Apple's financial reports
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.720]   and you know, sort of the line for software,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.680]   it's, you know, it's a few hundred million dollars
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.440]   which it's not chump change,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.360]   but it's nothing compared to those.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.200]   - And you have six billion dollars in profit.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.640]   - Yeah, six billion dollars.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.480]   - What do you need?
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.720]   - 100 million here, 100 million there, come on.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.780]   Give it away.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.040]   All right, maybe it's wishful thinking on my part,
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.480]   but we've got a great panel here.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.000]   I just hate to say a word 'cause I, Chris Breen,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   Andy Inato, John Gruber,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.680]   and Adam Anster here,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.720]   they are the top of the line in the Mac journalism world
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.640]   and we're really glad to have you.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.520]   We've got more to talk about, lots more to talk about,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.160]   including the latest malware for Apple.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   Adam Anster did a good story on tidbits about that.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.760]   We'll ask him and a whole lot more,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.080]   but first by Fred's,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.040]   I'd like to talk a little bit about our friends.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.600]   It's Citrix who do such great stuff
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.360]   and they've never left the Mac out and I really like that.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.920]   Any company that says,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.040]   we're gonna do everything we do cross-platform,
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.880]   I like it.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.240]   Citrix could easily just focus on Windows.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.840]   It's one of those products, you know,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.800]   they are known in the Windows universe.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.480]   They are the kings of remote access
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.240]   in Windows, but no, they say,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.360]   they realize how important it is to be cross-platform.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.840]   So the next time you hold a meeting, a teleconference,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.480]   that no matter what people are using,
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.560]   they can join that conference and be a part of it,
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.600]   not merely Mac and PC, but on their iPads too.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.760]   I'm talking about GoToMeeting,
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.520]   simply the best online meeting software out there.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.640]   And with that free iPad app, I mean, that's slick,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.480]   that is sweet.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.680]   The next time you wanna have a phone conference,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.560]   you wanna avoid the travel to meet in person
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.200]   with colleagues or clients all over the world.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.080]   Start a GoToMeeting, just takes a couple of clicks
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.440]   of the mouse and then anybody who's on a Mac,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.920]   or I guess if they're on Windows, if they want,
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.320]   or on an iPad can be part of that meeting.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.520]   GoToMeeting is $49 a month for as many meetings as you want
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.480]   as long as you want.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.600]   And I have to say, one of the beauty parts of this is
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.960]   that the iPad app is absolutely free
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.640]   and it's free for your customers
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.120]   and clients and colleagues to meet with you.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.840]   So that really means it's a very affordable solution
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.120]   for everybody.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.600]   Also, you don't have to get your giants to jump clients
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.520]   to jump through hoops to participate in your GoToMeeting.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.800]   All they have to do is click that link,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.400]   you send them in the email or in the calendar invite,
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.440]   or even via chat, or even you can just give them
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.520]   the number verbally, they go to GoToMeeting.com,
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.320]   enter the meeting ID and boom, the software installs,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.920]   it's always up to date.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.600]   And then they can not only see what's on your screen,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.760]   they could show you what's on their screen.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.400]   And the teleconferencing, the bridge is free
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.920]   if her phone and it includes VoIP as well.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.040]   So if they're on an iPad, they can use the iPads built-in
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.320]   microphone and speakers and they're part of the conference
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.160]   too.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   I'll never forget the first time that happened.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.840]   I thought, wow, this is awesome.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.720]   I was holding the phone in an iPad and I said,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.360]   oh, I don't need the phone.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.000]   I just use the iPad.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.480]   It's simple, it's smart.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.360]   People say dynamic, so happy we switched.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.320]   It is just the best.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.200]   Try it free right now for 30 days.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.360]   Visit GoToMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.320]   And then please use the word Mac break when you enter that in
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.920]   so that we get credit for your trial.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.040]   Go toMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.480]   use the code Mac break.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.040]   You're gonna love it.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.800]   Leo Laport here we are talking about,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.560]   hey, we spent a whole 20 minutes talking about Macs.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.880]   We didn't mention the iPhone once.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.760]   In fact, maybe let's not mention it again
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.160]   because the other big story, a huge story,
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.600]   actually Adam, you have the story on this is the virus toolkit
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.320]   that's being offered around for Macintosh.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.880]   Yeah, this is the age of innocence is over, my friends.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.200]   You wanna talk about a whole nother world
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.760]   starting to look into this security,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.520]   what's going on in the security world?
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.360]   All malware, I mean, when we got started,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.160]   viruses were people goofing around seeing what they could do.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.080]   Now malware is organized crime.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.880]   But, you know, criminals aren't always the smartest.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.800]   So sometimes they can't actually program their own stuff.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.640]   And so now what they do is they go out
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   and buy what apparently is being called a crime kit.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.280]   And that allows them to generate malware.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.680]   You sort of tell you, it's a graphical interface
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.440]   to making your own virus.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.760]   And then that virus can in theory be sent out
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.640]   and extracting credit card numbers
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.680]   or stealing authentication credentials, that kind of stuff.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.800]   And so yes, there's a Danish security firm, CSIS,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.560]   that has said they found the first evidence
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.960]   of the first crime kit targeting macOS 10
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.240]   in a fairly serious way.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.800]   And that's a little distressing, honestly.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.320]   You know, we've always sort of thought
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.800]   that we will run a little bit below the radar.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.000]   And this is perhaps indication that at least someone's willing
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.040]   to take a flyer on the possibility they can make money
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.800]   on selling to criminals who are gonna then steal
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.680]   credit card numbers from Mac users.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.040]   So it's still a little bit of a tenuous connection.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.720]   But hey, it's there.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   - My understanding was that was gonna be acquired by Sony though.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.960]   And so it wouldn't run on the Mac anyway.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.880]   So it's not really gonna be a problem, right?
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.080]   The really funny thing is I'm writing this up
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.280]   is I'm using exactly the same kind of phrases as you know,
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.600]   you know, and an iPad and Linux version
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.920]   is expected soon.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.440]   I was like, I'm writing about illegal software designed
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.680]   to break into computers.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.240]   I can't just use these exact same phrases
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.880]   as I do when I'm talking about, you know,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.280]   new products from real companies.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.440]   But yeah, installation was a great.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.480]   - It was almost automatic.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.840]   - There was also, and you'd have a story on this too, Adam,
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.760]   this Mac Defender pseudo virus,
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   which has been a real problem on the PC sides
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.200]   for a long time.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.920]   It's a kind of a blackmail technique.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   You put a phony antivirus on the people's system
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.680]   and then offer to disinfect for a price.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.040]   Of course, when you give your credit card to these people,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.240]   not only do they not disinfect you,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.560]   but they probably charge a bunch of other things
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.640]   like new iMacs.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.480]   (laughing)
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.160]   - Yeah, I think it's a pretty safe bet that, you know,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.520]   they're one will charge you for the software
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   and then they'll steal your credit card number.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.760]   So yeah, this is Mac Defender,
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.600]   and the people I feel really bad for
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.960]   is the, there's a website called Mac Defender.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.640]   It's a German software developer.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.240]   As far as I can tell, they do GPS and geocaching related software
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.680]   and English is clearly not their first language,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.720]   but they're taking a bit of a hit,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.120]   you know, they have to have big statements
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.840]   all over their website saying, it's not us, it's not us.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.920]   - The good news is that in order to get infected
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.160]   with this Mac Defender, you, the user have to jump through hoops.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   This is where Apple does have a little bit of an advantage.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.520]   This is the serious one.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.840]   So, you know, I mean, they can do some stuff
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.680]   to get it onto your computer.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.360]   They're using what's called, they're poisoning search engines,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.520]   search engine optimization, so they'll,
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.840]   they are getting sites about being bumped up
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.120]   in Google's results.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.600]   And so you can do a legitimate search in Google,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.560]   hit one of these sites because it's been artificially inflated.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.120]   And then, you know, end up going to the bad site.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.040]   And apparently what it does is it shows a kind of windows dialogue
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.960]   saying, you know, oh, scanning your system or whatnot,
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.160]   meanwhile, a JavaScript.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.240]   - By the way, when you see windows dialogue,
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.000]   it looks just like a Windows XP dialogue.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.800]   So that should be a hint.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.920]   - A hint, hint.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.120]   - So, but here's the thing is that even if it can get
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.720]   the software down to your computer, which you've got to still have,
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.040]   you know, the open, safe files, checkbox and Safari
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.360]   or have allowed the appropriate things in Chrome or Firefox,
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:48.600]   it runs this installer app and you have to give it
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.240]   your admin password.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.640]   - Yeah, it didn't, anything ever asked you for your admin password
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.440]   to install software that you didn't do?
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.720]   Don't do it.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.480]   Just say no.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.520]   - Yes, but people have gotten into the habit of doing this.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.280]   And when you look at these kind of trojans and schemes,
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.440]   you wonder, well, who's dumb enough to fall for this?
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.880]   Because one, I mean, how many times have we told people
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.720]   sort of off the record, you know, you don't really need to run
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.680]   antivirus software on your Macs,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.560]   even though we have to kind of cover ourselves and say,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.440]   there may come a day when you need to, but right now,
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.840]   no, you don't really need to.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   But I got an email from a couple of relatives last week
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.120]   who were saying, I've been told I've got a virus on my Mac.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.960]   What do I do?
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.840]   Unfortunately, they asked me first before acting and I said,
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.440]   you don't, it's a scheme.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.720]   Just leave it alone until you hear from me, don't touch it.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.960]   But I think there are any number of people who see this pop up
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.240]   and, you know, they don't really know the difference
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.520]   between a XP dialog box and a Mac's dialog box.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.200]   And they just go ahead and because they are accustomed now
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.120]   to saying, well, okay, by entering their admin passwords.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.160]   This is pretty amazing.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.080]   I'm looking at the, the, in Tigo was a company
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.720]   who discovered this and I'm looking at the screenshots.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.520]   You know, it's not that XP.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.240]   I was told it looks like XP.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.040]   The XP thing is on the web page.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.080]   Ah, okay.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.880]   So yeah, no, once you, the one thing that
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.240]   Antego was showing is that once you get this thing
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.640]   actually on your system, it's pretty, pretty reasonable looking.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.520]   You know, it doesn't have a horrible misspellings
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.000]   in the text and the graphics are reasonable and all that.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   So once it's there, I could easily see someone being fooled by it.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.520]   That's not the problem.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.600]   So, you know, I mean, if I'm going to, if I would, you know,
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.800]   sort of criticize Apple in any way for this,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.640]   I would say that you enter your admin password so often now
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.120]   that it's really easy to get into that just sort of reflex habit of,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.760]   oh, password, oh, I password, oh, I password.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.840]   And so, you know--
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.880]   - That's not Apple's fault though.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.440]   That's a problem on Windows as well.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.360]   I mean, if you're, you know, if you were going to say
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.400]   you have to escalate to install software,
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.800]   you have to escalate to do these things that viruses have to do,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.400]   you're going to hit it a lot every time.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.680]   We hit it more because I bet we install a lot more software
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.160]   than most people.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.080]   - Yeah.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.400]   Well, I get it so often that I really don't think very much.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.360]   And so it's a real problem.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   But I just think that there's got to be some research
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.800]   into different ways of doing admin level authentication
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.360]   that would be allow the user either a chance more to think
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.920]   or would, you know, say this is a different kind of thing
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.000]   that's going on.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.840]   So--
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.280]   - Microsoft, you know, recognizing this did turn down
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.440]   the number of alerts you see in the UAC,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.280]   which is their equivalent of this,
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.440]   because they recognize people go, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.720]   Apple never did it as much as Microsoft did.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.480]   But I don't, you know, if you do it at all,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.240]   people are going to get a little inured to it and say,
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.040]   yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing,
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.960]   especially since they've been told by this,
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.440]   that I am going to install software, I am Mac Defender,
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.280]   I, you need, they know you have to click okay to do that, right?
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.000]   So I don't know.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.040]   I mean, I guess the message should go forth
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.160]   that you do have to, Apple users are no,
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.520]   are not anymore in this, you know, Eden,
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.520]   somebody took a bite of the apple
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.360]   and you got to be careful.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.000]   Should people start buying Mac antiviruses?
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.680]   And I think that's, only the one that only wants to cost more
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.360]   than $80 a year for the subscription,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.040]   because those are the only ones that are actually good.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.200]   The more they cost, the better they are, right?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.400]   I'm very, I'm pretty disappointed.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.280]   It's every time that one of these quasi,
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.840]   every time there's like a black hat exploit,
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.800]   or there's a security firm that's a consultancy
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.880]   that needs to get attention.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.200]   Well, let's be fair, and Tigo sells antivirus.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.440]   Well, I'm not, I'm not.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.880]   This was a good one, at least in this case,
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.720]   where it really does.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.320]   Let him finish, go ahead, Adam.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.160]   Okay, but what I'm saying is that every time
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.560]   that one of these things hits the news,
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.480]   I always get another piece of information
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.320]   from another company saying,
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.760]   "Oh, well, we have the only effective Mac antivirus suite."
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.600]   And it turns out that doesn't actually do anything,
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.720]   but at least they're ready to build the database
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.200]   of people they can sell products to.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.840]   I really think that it is, I think,
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.120]   an interesting data point that not just individual viruses
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.560]   are being written, but now the tools for creating viruses
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   are now out in play.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.640]   So we're still in a situation where we don't need
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.720]   to have antivirus, but we should definitely,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.120]   if we were using the five-scale alert system,
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.960]   we'd be from blue to purple, let's say.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.360]   (laughing)
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.400]   Now that the US government isn't using it for the TSA,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.120]   we can co-opt it 'cause now it's in the public domain.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.200]   Purple sounds like swollen and distended.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   It doesn't sound good.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.040]   (laughing)
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.520]   And we have a show title.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.520]   It sounds like this has been lasting
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.760]   for more than four hours, please, your doctor.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.920]   What about this?
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.760]   Here's what I think.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.800]   I think that the good advice for typical Mac users now is,
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.840]   I used to tell my parents, I would just say,
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   "Don't install anything."
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.680]   - Yeah, that's not anything.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.520]   - "Don't install anything."
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.360]   - What do you tell your parents?
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.200]   That's the question, exactly.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.640]   - I always used to say, "Don't install anything
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.800]   without talking to me if anything ever asks you."
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.880]   I don't, they've been Mac users
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.840]   as long as they've had computers because of me.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.800]   And I don't recall that they're never running
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.920]   into anything like this where it seemed like something
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.640]   on the web was trying to install something under Mac,
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.920]   but I've told them, if anything ever says,
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.320]   "You need to install something, call me."
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.280]   So my mom will even call me when she gets prompted
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.600]   by software update that says,
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.840]   "Hey, there's a new stuff from Apple."
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   And I'll say, "Okay, yeah, just click that button
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.480]   and that's good."
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.000]   But for typical people, I would just say,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.240]   if you don't install any software on your Mac,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.320]   except through the Mac App Store.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.560]   - And our chat room, our chat room in Kuniko says,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.880]   "Just don't, just don't, when you install the stuff
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.680]   for your mom and dad or whoever,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.320]   don't give them the admin password."
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.880]   - Oh, I don't give my parents the admin password.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.720]   - So they have to ask you.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.400]   - And I also think in the big picture,
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.600]   it shows the whole appeal of the iPad to people.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.480]   Like people like us who are on this panel
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.880]   and almost certainly everybody who listens to shows
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.320]   like Mac Break Weekly are pretty confident
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.800]   that they can tell the difference between a legitimate,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.760]   "Hey, here's why an installer wants your password."
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.800]   Well, it does because I just double-click the installer
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.160]   package for the new version of Xcode.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.760]   I want to install something.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.080]   Whereas if I'm just reading an article on a website
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.520]   and all of a sudden I'm prompted for my admin password
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.920]   to install something, right.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.160]   But we have a level of sophistication about just a little bit
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.000]   about how these computers actually work
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.560]   and you're not gonna get fooled like that.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.920]   But there's millions and millions,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.040]   most people don't even have that sophistication.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.880]   They really don't.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.760]   And so when they see any kind of alert there,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.400]   they tend to think, "Well, I better trust it
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.560]   'cause I don't want to mess up the computer."
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.080]   That whole problem is just not there on iOS.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.760]   And I don't really, I think it's true for other new
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.200]   mobile operating systems like Android as well too,
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.560]   where individual apps just don't have the sort of privileges
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.680]   that we're used to.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.240]   Well, and the App Store solves this too
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.080]   on the desktop, doesn't it?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   Right.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.400]   This is one of the things that I actually found
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.960]   really interesting about that little crime kit story
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.240]   was that the data security firm said that they understood
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.160]   that there was an iPad version or iPad targeted version
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.480]   of this thing as well, which I thought was quite interesting
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.600]   because all the stuff that we know about
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.080]   is being security issues in macOS 10 and Safari and whatnot.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.120]   A lot of those do tend to move over into iOS,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   but iOS is also so sandboxed that a lot of the same kinds
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.200]   of things that might work on the Mac
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.360]   are just aren't gonna work.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.160]   It really amazes me because a smartphone
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.960]   is the best platform.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.200]   If I were a bad guy, that's where I target all my attacks.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.560]   It's always connected.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.360]   It's got all sorts of great information.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.680]   It's just a treasure trove.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.080]   And I'm really kind of shocked
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.760]   that we haven't seen big attacks.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.480]   I guess it says something to the sandboxing
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.160]   that all of the smartphone OS's do for that very reason.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:53.680]   I'd be very curious to what this kit does to own iOS
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.880]   'cause boy, I'd love to go up.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.640]   If I were, again, I'm not a bad guy.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.280]   If you were a criminal, I'm tempted though.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.640]   I gotta say, I'm tempted.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.040]   That's one of the reasons why possibly
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.160]   the most important feature on all of these smartphones
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.920]   no matter what the OS is the ability
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.040]   to securely remote Nuke it because I once had a,
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.960]   had a, an ebook reader stolen.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.480]   Fortunately, it was on, fortunately, it was on loan.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.560]   And the only thing, the only personal information it had
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.600]   was my Google log on.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.480]   And even that alone said, oh, damn it, what do they have?
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.320]   - That's enough.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.240]   - It turns out that they don't have my personal email,
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.960]   but essentially, but they could have been able
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.120]   to get onto Google Reader and see the stuff
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.560]   that I was reading.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.040]   I did, if I were using Google a lot more,
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.320]   for a lot more stuff, they also would have had my e-commerce
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.080]   stuff, they also would have had my personal emails.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   Again, none of that is true because I didn't actually use
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:42.920]   that way.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   All I had to do was change the password.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.240]   And so when we started looking at this,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.520]   this security problem, this privacy problem with the iPhone,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.680]   I started sort of almost by reflex and gosh,
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.240]   I really wish they were a manual way so that if I knew,
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.480]   I was, if I needed to get rid of a phone quickly
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.800]   that I'm not even satisfied with the ability
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.280]   to simply delete the hash key that encrypts all the data.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.040]   I want to overwrite this thing with zeros nine times
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.320]   if I possibly can to make sure that people can't pull
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.400]   the flash and just sort of see if they can read it off
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.720]   of there too.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.120]   It is a scary situation.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.320]   - Adam, what does this crime kit cost?
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.920]   And how do you pay for it?
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.760]   - It's not you.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.320]   (laughs)
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.680]   It's actually kind of interesting.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.600]   It's, again, a world I had new idea existed.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.120]   It costs about $1,000.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.680]   And it took me a while to figure out that it was $1,000
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.920]   because the price of the Danish security firm listed
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   was in 1000 WMZ/LR.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.480]   I'm googling around.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   - That's like kind of hell is it?
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.320]   - The hell is it?
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.000]   WMZ is like South African money or something?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.720]   But it turns out that there are a number of firms
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.400]   that as far as I can tell,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.920]   they're kind of almost laundering firms,
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.040]   money laundering firms.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.160]   I mean, maybe that's just,
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.520]   I mean, that's sort of the wrong way of putting it.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.000]   But basically they do a lot of currency conversions
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.760]   with their own unit.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.560]   And WMZ and LR, I'd have to go back and look what they are,
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.560]   but they are two of these sort of exchange unit
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.720]   money firms.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.480]   And there's an exchange rate you can actually look up.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   So 1000 of the WMZ is something like, I don't know, 875
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.640]   and I think that 1000 of the LR's was 935.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.040]   It was one of the things where I'm sort of going down
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.280]   this rabbit hole of researching this thinking,
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.360]   I don't need to know.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.440]   I really don't need to know.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.760]   I don't want these people knowing I'm even looking at them.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.240]   - Yeah, but I see here even ads on Google for exchange
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.440]   by seven WMZ and LR.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   - Yeah, it's money laundering, obviously.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.520]   - Yeah.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.360]   (laughs)
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.200]   - Yeah.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.240]   - But I'm just wondering who would entrust any kind
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.640]   of payment system to these people.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   (laughs)
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.080]   - But that's the whole point of these sites, I think,
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.360]   is that I think they act as anonymous middlemen.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.200]   So that neither part of the--
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.480]   - Oh, okay, so you have crooks on either end,
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.840]   but you have legitimate body in the middle.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.160]   So WMZ stands--
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.160]   - You can't lift each other up.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.880]   - WMZ stands for web money.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.880]   And LR says, yeah, liberty, yeah, liberty from what?
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.160]   - Liberty reserve.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.080]   And there are a lot of people that do this.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   I've, you know, Bitcoin, which is very interesting,
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.720]   we did a whole show on Bitcoin and security now,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.720]   I think, really, 'cause you can generate these bitcoins
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.040]   on your Mac or any computer with spare cycles.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.720]   And then there is a market for Bitcoin and cash.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.400]   And the only reason I could think of that,
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.640]   why that would be is because it's a great way
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.520]   to launder money, you know?
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.360]   - It's a little something.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.400]   - It's like this somewhere and it's this world
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.960]   of Warcraft money or it's gold.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.240]   - It almost sounds like one of those job interview questions
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.360]   where it's like a logic puzzle and it's like, okay,
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.680]   you're doing credit card transactions.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.040]   How would you design a credit card transaction system
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.720]   when your customers are credit card thieves?
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.560]   (both laughing)
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.240]   - This is really like-- - Totally a zara plan.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.920]   - Suddenly I'm imagining a really, really, really,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.000]   suspicious, like Google interview question.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.840]   Let's say that you operate a search engine,
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.360]   but your terms have used for bids you
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.760]   from monetizing personal pictures of people's firms.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.040]   How would you be able to circumvent this
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.320]   and just develop a presence in the Asian market?
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.560]   - You're on this code examples.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.880]   Use code examples if necessary.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.040]   - This is, and you're right, as I go to these pages,
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.840]   I get just the very queasy at them
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.000]   about looking at these pages because--
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.600]   - Well, as a, you know, this is the whole question of like,
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.440]   I mean, I gathered the some of these root,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.920]   these crime kits, you know, you get support too.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.480]   You know, you can just imagine like, you know,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.640]   the, like the, the, the, the hex cons, you know,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.480]   answering the phone, hey, what do you want?
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.760]   Help me. - Yeah, well, have these.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.480]   So here's your email address.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.160]   You want to change it from HD money or Liberty Reserve
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.600]   to, I guess you can only exchange from one to the other.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.800]   I don't know what HD money is.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.600]   - It's just about 10 of them, 10 of these exchange things
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.160]   that I found. - Amazing underbelly.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.280]   Wow. - Wow.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   - Yeah, yeah. - Wow.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.000]   - Isn't that, isn't it just freaky?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.960]   - Yeah. - Can you start seeing this stuff?
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.480]   - And, and as we talked about in the pre-show,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.840]   if you're going to do business selling to crooks,
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.320]   expect to be ripped off frankly.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.800]   - And on the other hand, you definitely don't want
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.880]   to break your license agreement because, you know,
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.240]   somebody's going to come over.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.520]   - Break your line and talk to you.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.480]   - No, no, no, one of these things I was looking at,
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.880]   they actually, of course, they've got copy protection.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.000]   - Oh yeah. - You know, they rock
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.560]   it to a single computer. - Oh yeah.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   - I mean, it's just, I mean, the irony here is just so wonderful.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.200]   - Amazing, just amazing.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.840]   Well, we're going to talk about location tracking
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.120]   and the white iPhone.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.640]   Is white thicker?
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.840]   - And we have another show title.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.080]   (both laughing)
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.480]   - We make a wider set of pale.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.880]   - A wider set of thick.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.560]   The pair, Apple says no, but will--
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.280]   - It's creamier. - It's creamier.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.120]   We know that. - It's creamier
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.040]   than Air Force.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.000]   - But Apple says the black is just as thick.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.800]   But we'll talk in just a bit about that.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.840]   First, I want to mention our friends at hover.com.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.960]   And guys, I'm going to give you a minute
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.200]   to think of some jokes, okay?
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.400]   This is your comedy writing moment.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.240]   - Uh-oh.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.480]   - Yeah, you got to come back with something.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.040]   Register your domain, save 10% right now

[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.520]   They don't sell a lot of services.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.840]   They focus on just making it simple,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   straightforward and easy to register
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.040]   and manage domains and email.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.400]   And there's some great features about hover.com.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.200]   Besides the fact that they don't upsell you
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.240]   every step of the way,
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.520]   some of these guys it takes 90 clicks to buy a domain,
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.360]   not at hover.com.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.720]   If you go right now to macbreak.hover.com,
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.800]   you can take a look at their simple, clean user interface,
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.840]   buy a domain, transfer a domain.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.000]   It just couldn't be easier.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.160]   And here's a special deal for Twitch and Macbreak audience
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.080]   members, free transfer concierge service.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.800]   One of the things I like about hover.com,
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.560]   and wish I had used, I didn't, I was cheap.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.720]   I wanted to save the 25 bucks.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.840]   And I said, oh, I could do those transfers myself.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.600]   I'm still in transfer domain transfer hell
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.480]   because those other guys just don't want to give it up.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.080]   Let hover do that.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.720]   And for you, you don't have to pay the 25 bucks.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.480]   Just go to macbreak.hover.com
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.680]   and they will do all the transfers for you
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   without any charge.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.480]   So you don't have to do any of that hard work
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.120]   of transferring the domain.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.320]   The transfer itself does cost $10 a domain
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.080]   but that extends your domain name,
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.120]   whatever the top level domain for another year.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.280]   That's a big bargain on a lot of these domain names.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.120]   And free who is privacy because they know
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.600]   you really want privacy.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.280]   Why should you be upsold to privacy?
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.640]   It just comes with a domain name.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.360]   I'm really a fan and I think you'll like it.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.240]   Next time you need to register a domain,
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.920]   macbreak.hover.com, you know what a really good use is?
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.560]   If you're still using an email address
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:12.320]   that has a AOL.com, an earthlink.net,
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.680]   a Comcast.net at the end of it,
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.840]   get off the ISP's service,
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.480]   create your own mail domain.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.680]   Then when you change ISP's,
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.920]   you don't have to change the email with friends or family.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.400]   You know, just use, you know,
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.680]   I have leoeville.com.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.040]   It forwards to Gmail.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.920]   But use hover to do the forwarding
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.800]   and you will never have to change your email address again
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.640]   and it looks more professional, to be honest.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.400]   Hover's great.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.560]   Macbreak.hover.com, give them a try today.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.400]   I think you will like them.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.440]   And by the way, if you need support and you call hover.com,
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.760]   you'll find they have a great policy.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.800]   No hold.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.840]   They will not put you on hold during regular business hours
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   when you call them at 86731-6556.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.800]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.240]   We thank them for their support at Macbreak Weekly.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:02.320]   All right, I've given the panel a chance to write their jokes.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   (laughing)
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.160]   We'll do this quickly.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.160]   There is a white iPhone.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.240]   Anybody, anybody buy one?
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.720]   I'm tempted to buy one just 'cause they,
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.640]   I have seen one 'cause I was at my kids high school
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.600]   and a kid walks up to me and he said, "Look, I got one."
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.120]   I don't know, was he waiting?
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.800]   Anybody have a--
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.640]   - Pent up demand.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.080]   - Is there pent up demand for the white iPhone?
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.800]   And why did Apple do a press release?
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.080]   Let's be honest.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.760]   - Because I think it's because it's a legendary failure
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.040]   of Apple and Apple must make sure people know that
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.280]   Apple fails at nothing.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.200]   See, we can do a white phone.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.040]   - We did it.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:39.880]   It took us a year.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.160]   - We've mastered the entire spectrum.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.120]   Light is as our unwilling servants.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   - We have black.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.640]   - And we have white.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.720]   - Right, it really is.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.040]   It's hard to believe, like if I would've told you,
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.440]   if I would've come on your show a year ago in May
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.960]   and predicted, you know, I think,
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.760]   here's what I think, I need to come out with two iPhone 4s,
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.920]   one's gonna be one color, one's another color,
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.800]   but they're not gonna be, they're not gonna wind up
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.440]   unable to make the one color for nine months.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.640]   You know, you would think, what?
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.600]   How can that be?
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.160]   It's Apple.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.800]   Like the one month delay, the first time when they're like,
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.920]   "Hey, this white one that's gonna take about a month,
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.520]   "wait till the end of July."
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.000]   That seemed like, oh, well, something weird happened,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.160]   but you know, even Apple screws up.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.200]   But when the July deadline came and went,
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.080]   it was like, this is like really, really weird.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.320]   - I was trying to figure out what could possibly explain
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.600]   that kind of a delay, because it's not as though
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.480]   they didn't test a white iPhone.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.840]   If there were, if there's, it had to,
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.440]   I figured it has to be manufacturing.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.640]   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to cover anything inside about it.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.600]   It's not a information about it, but it's like,
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.040]   it had to have been a manufacturing thing, don't you think?
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.000]   - Yeah, I guess so.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.720]   I mean, and I think with the PR,
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.840]   or with the interview that Ina Fried had
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.040]   with Steve Jobs and Shiller and forced all last week,
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.200]   I think one of them might have hinted it.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.320]   It was like an offhand remark,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.920]   but it was something about maybe the way
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.280]   that it aged over time, like they were making them.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.480]   I mean, anybody who was at WWDC last year
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.400]   could get their hands on one.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.480]   It had equal number of black and white ones in the thing.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.840]   But maybe it was like that thing,
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.520]   'cause remember a couple years ago,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.480]   there were the white iBooks that like,
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.960]   - They got like six, seven, eight months into the--
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.720]   - Yeah, they got yellowed over time.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.880]   And maybe they figured out that somehow the way
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.240]   they were making these, that they knew
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.160]   that these weren't gonna stay white over time.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.840]   And they, no.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.160]   - Yeah, I mean, it's not like Apple
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.760]   doesn't have some experience with white.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.800]   I mean, they've got this, and then there's this,
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.040]   and then we have this.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.880]   I mean, this stuff isn't Bakelite,
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.600]   where it starts up, you know, this kind of,
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.320]   and then suddenly a decade later, it's orange.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.840]   - You know, I have the original iPod,
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.440]   and I have a two thousand-- - I have a two thousand--
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.920]   - But it still works, then, you know, it's still white.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.880]   - I have a white 2003 iPod I was trying to get working today.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.640]   I can't get it to work, but it's white.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.120]   - It's still white, still white.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.400]   - Damn, I know, I'm still white.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.080]   Look, look, what they need to do to her.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.240]   - But then with ear, you know.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.320]   - Your wax, something.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.160]   - Ear wax, I don't know.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.240]   You know, you press against your ear
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.360]   and suddenly that heats it up.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.680]   - Okay, so don't put your white iPhone in your ear.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.920]   We know that much.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.360]   - Apparently, I think the problem was
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.400]   they were having trouble with the paint names,
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.160]   because everyone who's gone to buy paint knows that it's not white.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.000]   - No.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.480]   - There's mayonnaise, there's ivory tusks,
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.080]   'cause there's rich green. - Yeah, and a can be eye,
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.960]   'cause that's not politically correct.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.960]   - And don't buy mayonnaise paint for your house.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.600]   Just, I think that's a bad idea.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.920]   - It's delicious, though.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.960]   - Eggshell, anything like that, but not mayonnaise.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.120]   - It attracts raccoons, like no one's busy.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:37.960]   (laughing)
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.520]   - And then you're back to the same boring
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.680]   brown house you had before.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.600]   - You know, I love that the Consumer Reports
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.320]   took this so seriously, they actually measured.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.360]   (laughing)
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.880]   - And they say, according to Consumer Reports,
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.600]   the most trusted name in Consumer Reports.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.520]   - In white.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.000]   - Sorry about that. - Most trusted name in white.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.880]   They say it is not thicker, it just looks thicker.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.760]   (laughing)
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.520]   - Well, you had to write those calipers off somehow,
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:12.240]   and so, it's like DC of Oz, or do you see two ladies kissing?
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.400]   Well, it's an optical illusion.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.480]   They shouldn't have taken the test photos
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.840]   with all the lined up, like in front of parallel lines,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.760]   like that's what just bamboozled them.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.920]   - It just cracks me up.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.800]   - But when I was talking to people earlier on,
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.120]   I wasn't able to, like I said,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.880]   I wasn't able to find any inside information
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.080]   about the white iPhone, but I was talking to people
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.600]   who are in manufacturing, who said,
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.160]   very curiously, that white is one of the hardest things
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.600]   to make anything, especially if you're dealing with
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.320]   either a new material or a new process
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.160]   you haven't worked with before,
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.240]   because you can have something that's close to black,
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.600]   you can have something that's kind of the right shade of blue,
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.840]   no matter how careful you do it,
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.680]   you can get close enough that people will recognize
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.640]   as blue, but that's the one color where white is just white.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   It is, there's nothing else but white.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.840]   And so, now it makes me think that,
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.360]   they also explained to me that there are ISO procedures,
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.000]   they're standardized procedures
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.760]   for simulating aging on a material.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.600]   So, it's not as though they didn't find out
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.320]   until the samples started being six to eight months old.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   It's possible that they got something out of the oven,
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.960]   or they completed test suite,
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.680]   the second batch, the third batch,
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.000]   we're all starting to yellow, or we're all starting to fade,
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.520]   or, I wish I had the list here,
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.320]   but he mentioned like eight different sets of tests
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   on consumer devices, going to sunlight,
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.360]   going to the simple age, actual movement of air,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.720]   changes in heat, and there's also even a test for just
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   skin oil and tactile interactions like that.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.080]   And I don't know if it's jockin'.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.520]   Who gets paid to just keep doing like this on a phone
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.160]   like 12 hours a day on the show?
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   - I want that shot, be ships.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.480]   - But yeah, I thought that's one of those lines
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.120]   that's gonna stick with me.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.560]   One of my, huh?
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.560]   Did I just hear what I just heard?
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.160]   White is actually hard.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.640]   So, I hope that I do live long enough for like that book
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.600]   that explains, that really great skunk works book
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.400]   that explains everything that went into like
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.840]   developing Apple products, because there were a lot
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.120]   of people trying to figure out,
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.880]   how did Apple not figure out a problem
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.880]   before they were committed to a launch?
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.080]   - Can I submit, and you guys could shoot this down?
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.560]   A conspiracy theory?
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.640]   By holding on to this.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.560]   - I agree with that.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.320]   I endorse this 100%.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.160]   - It's a bomb of fault.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.800]   - I've seen the evidence that he's psyched.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.400]   And I validated that completely for--
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.920]   - By holding on to the white iPhone
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.160]   until shortly before the end of life of the iPhone 4,
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.160]   Apple can artificially pump up some, gin up some sales.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.920]   (laughing)
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.040]   It doesn't even say it with a straight face.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.560]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.400]   Maybe they didn't think--
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.120]   - So, Chris, Chris, do you have a white album
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.320]   behind you there?
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.240]   Can we see you know that, Sage?
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.080]   - I do.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:40.920]   Let's see.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:41.760]   Get more off the--
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.320]   - Chris is sitting in front of 100 yards worth of,
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.080]   believe it or vinyl albums.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.440]   And if they're alphabetical,
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.320]   if he goes to the top left, oh good they're not.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.960]   Oh, maybe it's white by, maybe it's--
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.440]   - He's organizing by color, actually.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.040]   - By color, yeah, he's looking in the white section.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   - If you have any pretty dark side Floyd,
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.040]   I'm coming the mood for that.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.120]   - You know, I really enjoy the fact that every time he's on,
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.800]   he has a different front-facing album.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.640]   I don't know what that one is,
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.040]   we'll have to ask him about it.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.880]   And ladies and gentlemen, from 1967,
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.000]   we give you the Beatles, actually it was a '66
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.640]   and the white album.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.080]   - This is '68 and--
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:17.920]   - '68.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.960]   - And not only do I have the white album,
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.040]   but it's white,
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.640]   - I have the one white-- - Last tick.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.320]   - That has not yellowed in any way.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.880]   - No, look at that.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.600]   - Chris, I'm so jealous.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.000]   Is that an original?
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.960]   - Yeah, this is a limited edition--
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.800]   - But it's not a touching one.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.960]   - Light, a vinyl press of the Beatles white album.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.720]   Now, if you were a real Beatalogist,
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.800]   you'd have the white album
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.000]   that has the butcher cover underneath the white.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.320]   - I still have all the pictures.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.160]   - Look at that, he's gonna--
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.320]   - Are we gonna get sued for this too?
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.480]   - Probably. - I'd probably--
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.440]   - EMI's coming after us.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.600]   YouTube is gonna pull the video down.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.200]   - I don't even show an album anymore.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.720]   - See, there's that.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.320]   - So if you go to the Verizon store
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.280]   to buy a white iPhone 4,
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.240]   you might notice a new little sticker on the back.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.880]   It says, "Remove before use,"
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880]   which you probably have to do
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   since it's on the front, actually.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.720]   (laughing)
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.040]   I don't think you could leave it on.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.400]   And it says, "This device, this is unbelievable.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.320]   This device is capable of determining its
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.840]   and your physical geographical location
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.560]   and can associate this location data
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.080]   with other customer information,
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.520]   to limit access to location information by others,
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.160]   refer to the user guide for location settings
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.960]   and be cautious when downloading, accessing,
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.680]   or using applications.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.680]   - I think somebody in Hupertino is pissed off as hell.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.880]   - I would be shocked if anybody at Apple signed off on that.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.160]   But do they have to, really?
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.400]   I mean, maybe they do.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.800]   - Oh no, I gotta be true.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.640]   I mean, 'cause of mine,
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.560]   the people who know your location are the self carriers
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.840]   and doesn't say a thing about that.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.280]   - That's a good point.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.480]   They should say we.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.680]   - It's not the device,
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.560]   it's the all-knowing Verizon eye in the sky
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.840]   knows exactly where you are at any given moment.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.440]   And we're happy to hand that over to law enforcement.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.760]   - So this is gonna be the last time
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.560]   we mentioned location gate.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.160]   Please don't throw anything at me for using that phrase.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.280]   But there was that great INAFRIED interview
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.600]   on All Things Digital.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.720]   And I think that it was Steve Jobs, interestingly,
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.200]   who gave that interview,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.640]   along with Scott Forstall.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.480]   - John Gruber, what was the story?
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.160]   What did they tell INAF?
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:43.920]   - Well, I think the interview was interesting.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.000]   I think maybe the story is better told from Apple's
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.080]   press release with the questions and answers.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.960]   - There's a huge FAQ in there, yeah.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.680]   - Right, but it is complicated.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.280]   And it's two different things.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.560]   And I'm not even sure that,
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.080]   'cause they intertwingle.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.640]   It's two different things that have a nexus
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.040]   in the Venn diagram parlance,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:12.120]   which is what is Apple collecting about location data?
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.800]   From devices sent back to Apple and stored by Apple.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.960]   And what are the devices themselves, your device?
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.040]   What is it remembering in a log or a database
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.040]   or a cache, whatever you wanna call it?
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.600]   But that's two totally different things, privacy wise,
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.840]   because this whole location gate story
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.440]   was about a log, a database cache,
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.960]   whatever you wanna call it,
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.040]   that's stored on your device
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.440]   and therefore backed up to your computer through iTunes.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.960]   But it means that anybody who wanted to take advantage of it
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.440]   would need access to the device
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.400]   or to your computer where your backups are.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.720]   That's not to say it's not a real issue
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.480]   because people lose phones all the time.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.840]   Somebody who's specifically targeting you could certainly
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.920]   try to steal your phone.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.720]   So to have that information,
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.120]   and most people, I certainly, I don't think anybody
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.280]   really realized that your phone contained a database like that
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.680]   that went back a year and more or less told you at least
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.240]   what basic vicinity you were in at any time over the last year.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.040]   Apple in the FAQ you refer to says something
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.240]   right off the top that kind of,
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.080]   it feels a little Clintonian.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.720]   Question one, why is Apple tracking the location of my iPhone?
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   Apple says, Apple is not tracking the location of your iPhone.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.160]   Apple has never done so,
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.240]   and Apple has no plans ever to do so.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.720]   Doesn't that sound like Bill Clinton saying,
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.880]   well it depends what your meaning it is?
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.000]   What's the meaning of it looking tracking?
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.200]   - Yeah, and I think that gets back to,
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.960]   they're trying to, and I actually think in hindsight
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.640]   that some of the tone of that Q&A is actually a little bit off
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.040]   because it's a defensive attitude towards that.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.560]   And I think that that's actually obscuring
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.200]   what they're trying to say,
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.640]   'cause they're trying to emphasize the first point,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.840]   which is what is Apple collecting
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.480]   about individual users' locations?
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.560]   And they're saying, we're not,
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.160]   we're not collecting your individual stuff
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.640]   that can be tracked to you.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:23.200]   But it all gets complicated when you use Apple,
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.240]   A-P-P-L-E as the subject, right?
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.560]   So Apple's not collecting it,
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.560]   but your iPhone is collecting it.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.240]   (laughing)
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.200]   - And that's what I mean by Clantonian.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.840]   Someone's collecting it.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.080]   - And Apple is collecting location data.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.080]   It's just not specific to individual users or devices.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.480]   It's about collecting location data
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.560]   about cell towers and Wi-Fi network hotspots.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.240]   So in truth, Apple's collecting location data.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.560]   In fact, according to F-Secure twice a day,
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.360]   about all iPhones in aggregate.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.440]   I understand that.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.040]   But Apple is collecting location data from my iPhone.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.360]   That sounds to me like Apple is tracking
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.560]   the location of my iPhone.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.040]   I understand they can't be back to me,
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.640]   but I think for them to say it's not doing that.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.360]   That's a mistake on their part.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.400]   - Well, they're saying they're anonymizing it though.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.800]   So they're saying they're collecting the data,
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.480]   but that doesn't mean they can connect it to you.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.760]   - I understand, but when they say unequivocally,
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.520]   Apple is not tracking the location of your iPhone.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.040]   That at the beginning of the FAQ, that's a mistake.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.800]   - Yeah, there's a filter that I,
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   when I wrote about this for the Sun Times last week,
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.560]   I essentially said that Apple needs to hire an autostel,
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.800]   which is somebody who doesn't use technology,
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.280]   doesn't own a million of bunch of phones.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.400]   She just gets $5,000.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.720]   Every time Apple wants to read them a press release
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.120]   or a piece of ad copy,
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.920]   just to see how someone who is not familiar
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.200]   with this sort of stuff would react to it.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.720]   - And then they go on in part two and say,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.560]   "Users are confused."
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.400]   - Dude.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.480]   - But they did put in the same paragraph.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.120]   They also said that Apple is responsible for not educating
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.040]   people the way that they should have said.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.680]   - And I think we're all in agreement.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.840]   - We're all in agreement on this panel that this is a
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.320]   kind of a tempest in a teapot, that anybody who's been
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.080]   attention knows that the phone does all this.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.160]   And it's, you're asked if you, you know,
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.400]   this is all part of the deal.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.200]   It's what a phone does, a smart phone does.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.040]   So I'm not berating Apple for doing it.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.240]   I'm just saying that they didn't handle it well.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.480]   Now the Steve Jobs Scott Forestall interview with Ina Fried,
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.800]   I think was pretty well done.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.720]   In fact, they revealed something that Apple is collecting
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.400]   a database of traffic information for a future service.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.000]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.400]   - Well, I thought what also was interesting is they used
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.920]   to do Wi-Fi location through Skyhook and then they stopped.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.760]   - Right.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.880]   - And yet they could tell where you were and they said,
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.200]   well, Apple is doing this.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.360]   Well, how are they doing this?
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.080]   Well, it turns out that that's what part of this information
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.720]   is for is that as you walk around with your iPhone,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.440]   it recognizes where Wi-Fi hotspots are and it sends
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.120]   that information off to Apple.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   - Right.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.520]   - Apple continued to use Skyhook until iOS 4 with ship,
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.120]   which wasn't that long ago.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.960]   But Google has been doing the same thing with its street view
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   cars, that's why Google got in trouble collecting data
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.520]   from access points in Germany.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.640]   - Well, no, Google got in trouble for a different reason.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.000]   Google got in trouble because they were not collecting
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.320]   just the location of the Wi-Fi points.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.200]   They were also getting snippets of the actual content
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.480]   and which was just a mistake.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.320]   I mean, it was stupid.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.640]   - In the process of doing a Skyhook style database.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.480]   - Right, precisely.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.040]   - Apple's not the only company that makes mistakes
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.400]   like this or these things happen.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.280]   - I mean, the other thing we're running into
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.760]   was kind of interesting, I was looking at my
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.920]   bits issue this week, because before there's two security
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.840]   things hit, we had the white iPhone, we had location
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.440]   gate stuff and, oh, the Snow Leopard font update.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.680]   So we had three situations where Apple basically screws up
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.200]   and then fixes it.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.560]   You know, it's nice to see them doing it, but it's also
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.240]   good to see that, hey, they're not perfect.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.600]   - Yeah, maybe that's part of the problem is that there is
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.720]   there is this kind of feeling in the general world,
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:10.480]   certainly among Apple fans, that Apple makes no mistakes
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.320]   that they're great odds.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.920]   - Yeah.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.760]   - Although it really does show you that it's part of a
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.840]   consistent pattern that Apple's following that.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.520]   Anytime that they can see an opportunity to reduce
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.760]   or eliminate their resistance on an outside companies
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.400]   technology or databases, they're gonna do it.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.080]   So if they have the ability to simply say,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.920]   what if we were to build our own traffic database?
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.600]   What if we were to build our own Skyhook database?
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.760]   What if we build our own system for traffic so we don't
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.920]   have to rely on an outside service for that?
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.440]   It's consistent with what they're doing with Flash.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.520]   It's just absolutely crystal clear consistent.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.360]   - Yeah.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360]   - Yeah.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.920]   - I also think that this whole thing is a good example
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.200]   of the importance of a demo.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:56.080]   By which I mean that this database consolidated.db,
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.480]   this file in iOS 4, which this demo uses,
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.120]   was has been known about apparently since like last August
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.480]   or so and by September, it was very well known within
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.400]   iPhone forensics circles.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.120]   There's a book that was published in November, October
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.880]   that says everything that everybody knows about it
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.960]   was right there, but it got no press, no publicity.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.000]   And when these two guys from O'Reilly found it
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.480]   and got interested, they took it one step further
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.840]   and wrote this real nice app and it hooks up to mapping APIs.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.880]   And all you have to do is download it
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.400]   and they provide the source code.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.000]   So if you don't trust them, you can check it out of GitHub
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.200]   and look to make sure that they're not sending
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.520]   this location data.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.800]   It just reads this file out of your iTunes backup
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.720]   of your iPhone and then shows you a map and has a little
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.600]   slider for the last like 12 months.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.880]   And here's everywhere you've been.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.720]   And I, like many people I downloaded it, I tried it
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.960]   and I have to say, I was, my eyebrows went up
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.360]   and I was like, wow, that's pretty much every place
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.360]   I've been in the last year.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.920]   - It was unfortunate 'cause the demo said
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.080]   we're gonna fuzz location data,
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.480]   even though the database has more specific location data.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.720]   So we never got to see how much the iPhone truly knows
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.620]   about our location.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.440]   It was, it was, it was, and so I would have loved to see,
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.640]   well, is it, now Adam, you point out that the iPhone showed
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.440]   you in places you've never been.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.760]   - Yeah, see the thing is, is because I travel all around
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.840]   upstate New York for races, when I looked at my data,
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.560]   it was, there was, you know, I could see the dots,
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.280]   presumably cell towers, that were in places where
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.720]   I've never even heard of before, but yes, I probably drove
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.120]   within 20 or 40 miles of there, you know, enough for the iPhone
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.300]   to pick up the area.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.820]   So it's pretty clear that it wasn't really getting,
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.180]   getting my actual location.
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.060]   The one thing that I found interesting is this,
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:41.700]   with some of our comments after that,
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.100]   I published my article on it, what people were saying was,
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.520]   but I actually kinda want that information.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.620]   I wanna know where exactly I've been.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.420]   And so some people were a little miffed about the fuzzing
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.540]   just 'cause they wanted to see--
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.220]   - I know, I did too.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.700]   I wanted to see it.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.340]   By the way, if you wanna see this book that,
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:01.940]   that John was talking about, you can buy it.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.660]   It's on Amazon, just 4662, it's an A-Press book.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.900]   iOS forensic analysis for iPhone, iPad and iPad Touch,
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.260]   and I can imagine that they've sold quite a few copies
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:17.580]   the last few days from members of the press.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.940]   So yeah, you can get on the Kindle right now,
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.740]   we wanna see, well, what else is in there
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.840]   that we should know about?
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.220]   I think that was part of the concern was that we know
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:29.440]   that police have these cell-bright devices
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.200]   that allow them to, in a minute and a half,
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.260]   suck all the data out of your iPhone and other smartphones.
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.540]   So I think that's part of the reason
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.300]   that people were concerned as well.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.440]   But you know what law enforcement doesn't need that,
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.240]   they can check in with your cell carrier at any time
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.340]   and say, "Hey, where's Leo right now?
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.820]   What's he up to right now?
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:47.980]   Should we arrest him?"
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:52.720]   - Yeah, you're more bothered by the idea of,
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.520]   again, the relationship that is going very, very badly
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.020]   and the person who lives with you in your house
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.280]   who has access to your computer.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.000]   - And that's a real issue, absolutely.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.160]   - Absolutely.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.800]   - And that's also the sort of thing where,
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.840]   if you're doing something in that sort of relationship
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.000]   sort of thing and you're still staying,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.440]   you're not leaving town, well, then maybe this data
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.840]   isn't gonna have any kind of incriminating stuff behind
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.620]   because you're only talking about a few miles.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.820]   But if you tell your wife that in October,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.200]   you were going to a conference in San Antonio
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.160]   and then she fires this thing up and you were in Vegas.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.320]   (laughing)
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.520]   You can't say, "Well, no, I must have been connected
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.000]   to a cell tower in Vegas while I was in San Antonio."
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.880]   - Oh wait, the plane, the plane flew through Vegas
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:40.720]   on the way.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.160]   - Yeah, I left the phone on, actually,
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.900]   that's a good, I'll remember that.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.880]   Now you wanna sign up for a courier
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.760]   who will carry your phone to other locations for you
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.880]   and you have your spare phone that all's with.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.960]   You know, I use Google Latitude
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.200]   on both the iPhone and on my Android phone
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.000]   and it says exactly where I am at all times.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.080]   It updates every 30 seconds.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.480]   And, you know, so we're using these tools, we know this.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.320]   And in some ways there's a real advantage to that.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.920]   I love the idea that I can do find my iPhone and find it.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.040]   I wish it were more accurate.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.840]   My son, my friend and my son lost his iPhone
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.720]   and we did find my iPhone and it was in a bait,
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.000]   we thought it was in a baseball field.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.040]   I spent hours searching that baseball field
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.440]   and turned out that was where he was
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.120]   and he had it at home.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.080]   (laughing)
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.320]   That was a pain in the butt.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.800]   So Apple is going, and Steve Jobs said this
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.520]   when we will go, we will testify.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.400]   The Senate has called a hearing.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.480]   Apple and Google both are going to respond to this hearing
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.720]   on mobile device privacy.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.960]   I have to say, and Jobs points this out
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.480]   that on an iPhone, anytime any app uses location data,
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.560]   you get a pop up.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.480]   Even if you've given a permission before,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.560]   Android does not do that.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.320]   You give it permission once and it continues
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.120]   to have that permission as long as that app is there.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.280]   - On a per app, I love this.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.680]   - Yeah, on a per app. - On a per app.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.840]   And at any point, even if you just want to reassure yourself,
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.040]   you go into preferences and see a list of every single app
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.520]   that can access location controls,
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.840]   you can physically see, okay, I have allowed this app,
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.160]   this app and this app and all the others are not allowed.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.640]   - And you can revoke it, right?
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.480]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.960]   - And it also shows you which ones have actually used it.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.280]   Not just which ones have you've granted the permission to,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.680]   but you can go and check and say,
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.840]   which apps have actually used my location recently?
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.480]   - So in this respect, I think Apple's done a very good job.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.640]   I wish they would do the same thing for the camera
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.720]   and the microphone, but maybe they were at some point.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.800]   But I think that's exactly how it should be handled.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.200]   - I agree, I think that's a good point.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.600]   I do think that they should do the same thing
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600]   with the camera and the microphone.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.560]   - Yeah, you bet.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.040]   Since we now know that there are apps without our knowledge
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.400]   that turn those things on.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.040]   - Right, like the color app where,
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.080]   and it's super clever.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.720]   I mean, it's ingenious where they use the,
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.320]   you think you're using a photography app,
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.600]   so I don't think anybody is surprised
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.960]   that color turns on the camera.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.920]   - But it also uses the microphone
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.960]   because it tries to identify,
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.720]   hey, this sounds the same as the other guy
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.920]   who's using color, so they must be in the same place.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.040]   - Actually, and I don't, this I find hard to believe,
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.400]   the color people told us that it doesn't even do a fingerprint.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.600]   I thought it was doing a fingerprint,
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.120]   like this is the noise level.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.520]   It's just seeing if it's a noisy room
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.280]   or not a noisy room and setting a bit.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.080]   The reason being, I guess, if you're in a busy room,
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.200]   you're more likely to have other people using color.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.080]   If it's a quiet room or we're not gonna,
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.600]   it doesn't, to me, it didn't pass a sniff test,
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.800]   but he seemed like an honest, nice guy.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.400]   And so I believe him, but it was just--
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.920]   - And you paid him in WMC.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.000]   (laughing)
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.840]   - I don't wanna impue these guys,
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.080]   but that's a strange thing to do.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.360]   Well, we just wanna see if you're in a noisy room.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.200]   (laughing)
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.560]   And by the way, they never send any sound back
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.920]   to their server, they say.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.840]   The problem is this stuff is impossible
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.280]   to verify the way it stands now,
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.880]   and that's, we have to trust that Apple is checking this
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.760]   when they approve the app.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.560]   - One of the things that I think is worth keeping in mind
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.160]   whenever you're dealing with any of these
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.160]   sort of questionable practices is, where is the money?
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   So when people are getting into a bunch about how
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.120]   Apple's tracking your iPhone,
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.440]   never think, well, why would Apple want to track your iPhone?
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.360]   - Right.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.800]   - How is this in any way going to benefit them
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.080]   without endangering their massively lucrative iPhone business?
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:26.920]   - I agree.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.000]   - You see where the money is.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.880]   And so I think that investigative journalism rule
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.720]   followed the money, and if you can't follow the money,
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.680]   it's probably just a technical mistake
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.680]   or nothing at all.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.200]   - I think that's exactly right.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.360]   Can sit, when you're examining Facebook, Google, Apple,
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.680]   ask yourself, where do they make their money?
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.080]   What is it that they do to make money?
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.480]   And-- - Facebook makes money.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.680]   - Someone will figure that out.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.600]   (laughing)
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.840]   - And how would they make money?
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.520]   By, you know, same way Google does,
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.360]   by taking personal information and targeting ads
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.720]   to that personal information.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.640]   Apple doesn't make any money on that.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.560]   - I am looking forward to a,
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.480]   if they're gonna do traffic data,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.040]   they're gonna do a map app, right?
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.600]   'Cause right now they use Google Maps,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.520]   you can't just put the traffic data to Google Maps.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.800]   It sounds like Apple would be doing a specific application
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.440]   for that purpose, right?
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.480]   - Maybe a-- - And, yeah.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.080]   - Maybe a term by turn GPS.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.360]   - Yeah, I think Avagon like or Tom Tom like.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.560]   - Well, I think that has something to do with the way
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.080]   this, the FAQ is worded, that Apple doesn't want
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.560]   to show its cards.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.400]   I mean, we know they're very private
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.880]   about what they're working on, and so they wanna,
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.800]   yes, we're not collecting personal information,
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.080]   but we are gonna do something with it,
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.840]   but we're not gonna tell you what that is
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.600]   because we've got something very cool coming down the line,
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.160]   but we can't expose that by saying,
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.120]   okay, we did this, this, this, and this with it.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.840]   - Yeah, sometimes it really is like talking to a six year old
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.880]   about whether or not he brushed his teeth, right?
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.720]   - Yeah, right.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.760]   - You have to say one hour ago,
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.720]   when I told you to get ready for bed,
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.000]   did you take out your toothbrush, put toothpaste on it,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.520]   scrub every inch of your teeth inside and out,
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.080]   spit it out, and then put the toothbrush back?
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.520]   You can't simply say, you know, you've given the out of,
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.520]   yes, I have brushed my teeth in my life.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.280]   - No, they're saying, look, white iPhone!
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.200]   - Andy, for somebody who doesn't have kids,
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.360]   you're very smart.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.040]   - See, because I have not been living with kids
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.280]   for 10 years, they have not ground me down.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.720]   (laughing)
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.640]   I have, back when my nieces and nephews were young,
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.080]   they did, they did want the kids like a few years ago
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.440]   to tell me that the thing is, when you babysat us,
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.600]   we couldn't get away with stuff
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.040]   because you were thinking about everything that we did.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.640]   - Don't mess with Uncle Andy.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.960]   Actually, I don't even know if I trust somebody
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.320]   named Uncle Andy.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.400]   (laughing)
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.240]   - I'm sorry.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.880]   - Apparently there's a, somebody in the chat room
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.760]   just told me there's a job posted for an iOS maps application
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.960]   developer for Apple.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.600]   Come work for the team that revolutionized
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.480]   the mobile technology industry as it continues to define
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.320]   what computing looks like in a post-PC era.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.480]   Boy, they even put cell copy in their job descriptions.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.520]   The maps team is looking for a proactive
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.640]   and hardworking software engineer to join our team
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.720]   along with excellent skills and object-oriented software
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.080]   design and programming.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.360]   The successful candidate will have real world experience
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.120]   developing sophisticated user interfaces.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.240]   - We're looking to fill the position of maintaining
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.840]   our supremacy and awesomeness.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.360]   (laughing)
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.160]   - If you wanna work for the best company
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.320]   the world has ever known or ever will know.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.160]   - I have to say, as someone who was just traveling
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.800]   a whole bunch in the last 10 days,
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.560]   I like the idea of the maps app,
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.080]   but boy, does it bug me to use it.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.240]   You know, if you wanna do more than find out where you are,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.880]   it's just, I find it frustrating beyond belief.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.160]   You know, I'll take one of the turn-by-turn navigation
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.360]   maps any day.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.800]   - Well, Sandy and I love the MotionX products.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.640]   There's a, I would highly recommend MotionX GPS.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.560]   You know what, Randall Schwartz told me he does,
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.280]   before he goes to any city, he doubt you can cache the maps.
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.640]   He downloads all the maps so he doesn't have to spend money
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.080]   on data.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.800]   And then the GPS drive is, I think the best turn-by-turn
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.360]   GPS I've ever used, it's great on the iPad
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.120]   'cause of this big screen.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.600]   I use it at the time.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.000]   - I think it's the only one that really communicates
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.600]   as an iPhone or an iOS app, as opposed to,
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.920]   here's software that we built for generic $69 dashboard
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.960]   things and hey, well, you know, let's just copy it.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.240]   - If you were gonna buy a TomTom,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.400]   it would look just like this.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   - Isn't that funny? - I'm pretty fond
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.920]   of Navagon. - Really?
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:47.920]   - I found Navagon.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.400]   Navagon doesn't, there's, I know exactly what you're talking
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.120]   about, there was a co-pilot.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.240]   Looks like it was, you know, like a port from a Commodore 64
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.120]   or something. - Right.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.600]   - But, but Navagon, you know, I do not get frustrated
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.120]   by, you know, the lack of iOS conventions.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.200]   Toolbars were, contacts were, things like that, so.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.840]   - Before we get to our picks of the week, one more story.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.320]   It's purely speculative, but we keep seeing rumors
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.840]   about iCloud.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.760]   Now there's code, people have noticed in the developer
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.360]   release of OS 10 Lion that refers to something called
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   Castle and moving all your mobile media to the Castle.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.040]   - In the sky. - In the sky.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.600]   - That's a shock reference, I think.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.600]   (laughing)
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.480]   - Is it?
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.320]   Is that what he calls?
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320]   - Yeah, yeah, the CIA headquarters is,
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.800]   or their hideout is called Castle.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.400]   - Jeez, it's, hey, hey, I actually knew a guy,
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   I got a pop culture reference.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.320]   - That's awesome, that's awesome.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.360]   - So now we know that's what the Castle is, but presumably,
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.800]   we're still looking for what is that
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.320]   North Carolina data center for?
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.640]   It's so much bigger than the data center Apple currently
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.080]   has in Newark, California.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.560]   It must be for something.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.160]   iCloud is the rumor.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.680]   John Gruber, Adam Anks, do you guys, you know,
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.760]   got your finger to the pulse, Chris Breen at?
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.160]   We got four of the top Mac journalists in here.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.240]   Somebody must know something about iCloud.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.580]   One of you knows too much and can't say.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:20.240]   - Not me, I don't know anything.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.640]   - Anybody, just anybody, just anybody,
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.800]   NDA'd, anybody wanna say?
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.760]   - It's such a good boy sitting so clearly
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.640]   you're with the air.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.600]   - The rest of you could speak.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.520]   (laughing)
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.080]   Anybody may recuse himself, but do you think this is true?
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:36.920]   What would it look like?
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.400]   Well, I'll start with you, Chris Breen, iCloud,
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.520]   what do you know?
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.720]   - I know nothing, but I think it's about time.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.200]   I think this is one of those situations.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.440]   - It's not about time you know nothing,
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.840]   it's about time there was an iCloud.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.240]   (laughing)
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.120]   - Although those of us who have been walking
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.640]   in your shadow are just glad you admit
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.040]   that's about time you know nothing.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:53.880]   - Yes, right.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.480]   It's one of these situations where Apple
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.880]   has always given credit for innovating
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.000]   and making things out of thin air.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.440]   But they're also very, very good at taking technologies
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.000]   that are terrible and making them great.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.400]   And I think this is one of those situations.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.480]   The difference this time is that they actually made
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.360]   some effort to get into this market
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.240]   much like they did with the original Apple TV.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.240]   It isn't very good.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.560]   Mobile Me just isn't what it should be.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:25.520]   And Google is better, but it's still too fragmented
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.080]   and too difficult to use for normal people.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.760]   So I think this is the reboot
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   of a sinking cloud-based service that actually works.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.160]   And then it takes your media
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.400]   and puts it in the cloud so it's available everywhere.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.040]   I think that's the dream,
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.600]   is having your media in the ether
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.000]   so you can get it anywhere you want.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:47.840]   Now that you limit this.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.840]   - Does media or perhaps my docs as well?
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.200]   - Oh, I think everything.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.960]   I think it just becomes an extension.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.760]   So it's now the Big Mac in the sky.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.400]   - And Apple Dropbox, for instance, something like that?
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.160]   - Yeah, well that would certainly make sense.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:03.040]   I mean that's so good for the Apple not to look at that
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.520]   and say that's the standard that we have to at least meet
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.560]   and better if we can and do it free, best of all,
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.640]   or at least for a very reasonable price.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.040]   I think people try to like Mobile Me
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.680]   and if you use all the parts of it, it can be very good,
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.160]   but most people don't.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.920]   Sinking is still a mess.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.520]   And that's number one,
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.840]   fix sinking on iOS devices and the cloud and your computer.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.200]   And people will be greatly relieved.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.360]   And then after that, the media is important.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.160]   It's nice to be able to get your media wherever you are.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.520]   Ideally it would be all your media,
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.360]   but I think it's gonna be Apple's media.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.200]   - Well, there's real issues.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.840]   You know, we had Michael Robertson of mp3.com
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.120]   on triangulation and his company mp3.com
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.200]   was put out of business by the record companies,
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.280]   particularly Universal Vivendi, who sued him.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.240]   'Cause what their service, it was such a great service.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.440]   And nobody's done it since.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.600]   You would put a CD and there would fingerprint the CD
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.120]   and say, okay, yeah, we got that one.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.880]   And then you'd be able to play that song back
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.120]   without ripping it, without uploading it.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.680]   Now everybody, including Amazon,
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.120]   requires you to upload it because of that decision.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.440]   So I can't imagine that Apple,
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:12.000]   but on the other hand, if you just eyes with Amazon,
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.760]   if you buy a song from Apple,
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.960]   then you bought the license so we can say, yeah, we got it.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.800]   - Yeah, I mean, that's where it ought to be,
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.560]   is that they've got a record.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.000]   Yeah, I bought it here.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.360]   And then they could prove that.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.480]   - Yeah, you're right, because if you've ripped CDs
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.000]   that you've gotten from the library or elsewhere,
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.960]   they have no way of knowing that you actually own it.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.280]   So that becomes a real issue.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.840]   - John Gruber, you sound like you agree
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.160]   that iCloud is a Dropbox clone.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.320]   - Well, I don't think it might be a clone, maybe it won't.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.160]   I hope so, I hope it can replace Dropbox.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.080]   But here's the other factor in this
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.320]   that I think is essential and Dropbox is definitely
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.240]   a key to it, is the role that Dropbox is growing
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.760]   to take for third party developers, right?
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.880]   'Cause there's not just a cottage industry
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.360]   in iPad text editors.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.440]   There's a cottage industry in iPad text editors
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.680]   that specifically use Dropbox as the back end in the storage.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.520]   - Plain text.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.360]   - And some of them are great.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.600]   I bet everybody here has a couple of favorites.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.880]   They're fantastic, right?
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.120]   There is no way to do that through Apple.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.160]   Like if you're just wanna write a text editor
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.960]   that syncs data, Apple has no answer for you, right?
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.000]   And so you've got to count on the user
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.320]   having a Dropbox account.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.640]   Now Dropbox is free and it's great,
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.280]   but it's just like Andy said before,
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.200]   Apple doesn't like to rely on other people.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.560]   And the truth is iOS users are reliant
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.360]   on their free Dropbox accounts
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.800]   for an awful lot of important syncing stuff.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.680]   - Yeah, if you wanna use iPad with data,
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.880]   you really, you need a Dropbox account.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:46.800]   - Right, and the whole appeal of being an iOS developer
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.200]   and why you jump through a lot of these hurdles
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.040]   and go through, you know, put a lot of the control
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.920]   of your fate in Apple's hands is that Apple does give
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.760]   so much back.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:59.000]   Like people who really get into cocoa developing now,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.200]   that it's a really rich API and you get all sorts of stuff.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.840]   You get the ability to do fancy animations
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.680]   and to make stuff that looks really good
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.960]   and you get Xcode and interface builder
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.240]   and these really good tools and they really, really work hard
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.360]   to give you lots of stuff that you can just work
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.200]   on what your app specifically does.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.720]   But they give you nothing for syncing data
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.560]   over the cloud and it's absolutely essential, I think.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.520]   So just for example, if you do a game, right,
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.120]   you should be able to drop your iPad,
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.480]   or not drop it, but put it down, pick up your iPhone
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.680]   and go back to the same level you were on
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.400]   in whatever game if they have a version for both.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.440]   And the developer of the game shouldn't have to worry
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.000]   about setting up their own syncing service
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.600]   and maintaining a web server and latency
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.760]   and not losing data and privacy and all of this stuff.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.440]   They should just have to worry about making a good game,
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.440]   but they should absolutely, you should be able
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.040]   to sync your data or if you get a new phone,
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.120]   you should be able to just download the app
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.240]   from the app store, give it your credentials
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.320]   and hey, we know where you were.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.620]   Here's the last level you completed.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:14.200]   - You agree?
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.920]   - I agree completely.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.920]   I think that the larger thing is that every time
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.320]   that I think any one of us has thought about a product
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.280]   that already existed and then thinking,
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.880]   well, when's Apple gonna come up with their own phone?
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.760]   When's Apple gonna come up with their own network?
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.880]   When's Apple gonna come up with their own this or that?
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.920]   We can sort of figure out what it would look like
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.880]   if it had an Apple logo on it, but what Apple does is
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.720]   they will just simply say, if we were to transplant this
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.680]   into the Apple universe, what would it need to do?
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.480]   What would we, we don't just wanna build
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.600]   a $500 laptop computer, we want to figure out
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.120]   what people are using these $500 laptops for
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.880]   and figure out the best way to implement all those things.
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.040]   So it would be very easy.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.080]   Apple's already done something that was sort of similar
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.000]   to cloud services.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.520]   They have iDISQ, iDISQ will sync to a local hard drive
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.520]   and they'd have iWork.com, which is a way
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.320]   you can sort of share files through mobile apps
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.600]   and through desktop apps.
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:12.680]   But I think that when they finally do release
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.400]   whatever cloud service they're doing,
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.440]   it's gonna be just as different from Dropbox
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.680]   as the iPhone was to every other smartphone
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.120]   they'd seen before then.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.480]   They're the only company that can,
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.880]   they're the only people who can actually see all the pieces
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.760]   that are on their particular chessboard
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.440]   and they're the only ones that can build a service
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.880]   to take advantage of everything
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.400]   that they're gonna be doing it year from now.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.920]   So that's why I'm hesitant to even guess
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.320]   as to what their service is gonna do.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.200]   It does make sense for an OS maker to do the cloud.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.000]   Yeah, this is really is Apple's age
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.280]   because if there was ever a time in computing
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.120]   where you needed one, you needed a user needed
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.080]   to put their fate into one company
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.960]   that could manage as much of the experience as possible.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.640]   The fact that we have mold devices
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.120]   that can put that kind of software power in your pocket
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:01.760]   and available to you 24/7 and in a wireless networking system
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.680]   so that it's no longer necessarily important
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:07.800]   that a file be here or an app be running on this hardware.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.400]   It's, you can do this, these sort of features.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:14.360]   Okay, if you have accepted international standards
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.400]   but you can do them fantastically
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.440]   if you have one company that's building all the technology.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.600]   Adam, you sound like you, a dissenting opinion.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.040]   Well, here's the thing.
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:28.600]   I agree that that would be nice.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.400]   Apple is the company in the bright position.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.720]   They certainly got the examples
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.240]   and I would love to see them do it.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.040]   The fact of the matter is Apple has never gotten
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.840]   internet services right.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.760]   They've been bad at it from the very beginning.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.000]   I mean, I go back to--
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.800]   Damn it, Andy said.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.400]   I thought it said yet.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.400]   Yet.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.000]   Oh, I said damn it.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.480]   The, I mean, back in 1996, I actually wrote a white paper for Apple.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:00.080]   I had an office overlooking the icon garden, everything.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.520]   And sort of the joke was is that when I was done,
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.680]   they were, you know, I was writing about their internet strategy.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:05.960]   And the joke was when I was done,
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.400]   they were gonna have an internet strategy.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.480]   And that proved to be really correct.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.280]   I never finished that white paper, says, and I missed.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.920]   No, the problem was I had to go around and talk to them
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.000]   about what their internet strategy was
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.440]   instead of just sort of telling them
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.920]   that no e-world wasn't dead.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.840]   Oh.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.160]   And it was-- but the fact is that every time I see them
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:29.480]   do something, whether it's iTools or .Mac or MobileMe,
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   they just-- they don't get it.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:37.960]   It's like they want to do the internet service that's easier
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:41.880]   than everyone else's or that's not as full-featured
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:44.080]   so that it's simpler to understand.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.560]   And they just end up not getting there.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.120]   So it's not like they don't do a good job sort of eventually
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.400]   in certain ways, like MobileMe male, the web male clients,
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.360]   not too bad.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.280]   It's nowhere near as good as Gmail.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.280]   Yeah, they just don't get it.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.560]   You know, sharing photos--
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.320]   Have they made acquisitions that might help the Siri team,
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.880]   people like that?
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.040]   Nah, I don't know.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:13.200]   I mean, it just feels like it's not in the Apple DNA
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.800]   to understand what the internet is about.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.200]   And they don't do sharing well.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.440]   And you think that's because we want to make it so simple?
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:26.360]   And again, what John was saying, what Dropbox is brilliant
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.880]   about is that they've opened it up.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.960]   They've made it available to anyone.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:36.240]   And that's one of the reasons why Dropbox is just so good.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:41.760]   And I get this worry that Apple would, for instance,
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:44.120]   like, oh, we're not going to do growl notifications.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.240]   I happen to really like growl notifications in Dropbox.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.720]   That's actually a function that makes Dropbox more useful.
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.880]   But it's not Apple, so they won't.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.760]   Precisely, they will not do it.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.960]   So even if they were to get sort of the basics of it there,
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.120]   it wouldn't be there.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.200]   Look at Time Machine, a kind of clunky way of doing backups.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.000]   Compare that with Crash Plan.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000]   Much less CPU power.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.320]   Much less bandwidth.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.360]   Works perfectly over the internet.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.480]   You know, why isn't Time Machine doing
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.760]   sub file updating to the cloud?
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.440]   Why not?
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.160]   I mean, that's the kind of thing where they just
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.320]   don't seem to get there over and over again.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.960]   And so as much as I really want to believe,
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.040]   maybe if we all like, we think about it really hard.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.160]   Clap our hands.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.680]   I do believe in series.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.440]   But it just hasn't-- I've been burned every time, I think.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.440]   Oh, they're going to get it right this time.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.280]   I mean, remember the Mobile Me launch?
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.800]   Whoa, did they biff that one?
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.120]   I do have to say, though, and that's
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.720]   one of the things I like about Dropbox.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.200]   If you implement it properly, the ease of use is spectacular.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.760]   It's also easy to do it badly.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.080]   And I've tried other clones of Dropbox like Walla,
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.800]   where I've just gotten bit because the ease of use isn't as good.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.160]   So you could really screw things up badly, too.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:56.960]   But done right.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.480]   It should.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:57.880]   It should.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.440]   Yeah, done right.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.680]   You know, I understand that on iOS, particularly
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.640]   on the iPad, they don't want a file system
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.520]   because that's confusing to people.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.280]   But that's the beauty of something like Dropbox.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.440]   It kind of hides the details of a file system.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.840]   And it just means it stuffs available.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.040]   It's out there.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.960]   I will say that I think Apple has to get it right this time.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.920]   Because I think in the past, it was a luxury.
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.520]   I think that web services like Eworld and this thing,
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.400]   it was like, yeah, it's kind of a sideline.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.960]   That's not where the world is today.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.600]   We're now at a point where we absolutely
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.600]   have to sync stuff with a cloud.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.080]   We're not sitting in our desk anymore.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:32.840]   It's everywhere.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.160]   And we've got these mobile devices.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.960]   So I don't think Apple can screw it up.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:38.680]   And I think they're probably aware of that,
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.280]   that they really have to have something that is as good.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.040]   And the likely better than what I think is really great.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.080]   Chris, as much as I want to believe you, IWork.com.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.040]   OK, but end of story.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.360]   How could they come up with something so bad with things
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.600]   like Google Docs around to show them
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.160]   this is where the bar starts, guys?
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.320]   Because I have to think that this is probably--
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.840]   that was a stopgap measure.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.040]   And that on the whiteboard, there is really the solution.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.000]   And that's probably what we're going to look at next.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.520]   I was about to say, imagine going into a friend's house
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.440]   and he's got the kitchen remodel almost completely done.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.200]   Only his kitchen sink is a $30 industrial sink from Home Depot.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.120]   And he said, how to get he screw up something
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.280]   as simple as a sink.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.840]   He just doesn't get sinks.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.840]   Then he realized that, oh, actually, there's
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.440]   about 10 square yards of beautiful Italian marble that's
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.000]   still being shaped and fitted.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.240]   And when that marble countertop comes in,
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.000]   then we're going to see this incredible basin that's
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.480]   absolutely perfect.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.440]   I really think that Apple is just waiting
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.640]   for the marble countertops to get to come in
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.080]   before they drop in this wonderful cloud service that
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.000]   makes that it needs.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.160]   They can get it in the right white, you think?
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.040]   Hope springs to turn on, right?
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.280]   I look forward to it, Cloud.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.600]   I think we'll see it fairly soon.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.080]   Apple has bought the domain name according to GigaOM
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:03.320]   from a Swedish company, rumors for $4.5 million.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:06.200]   The Swedish company has changed its name from iCloud.com
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.920]   to cloudme.com.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:14.120]   Maybe it was $4.5 million and a name to be remain named later.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.400]   They're just swapping the me.com domain for us.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.360]   You can have our me now.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.800]   We don't want it here.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.320]   We don't want it here.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.560]   You can have it.
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.240]   Real quickly, one last story that I almost forgot.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.240]   According to EE Times Intel, maybe the next supplier
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.840]   of processors for iOS devices Apple currently uses
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:38.360]   their mortal enemy, Samsung, for the A5.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.440]   Intel certainly would love to have that business.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.280]   Intel's never done well in the mobile business,
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.160]   even though they've created some architectures designed
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:44.720]   for mobile.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.040]   They seem to lose to ARM every step of the way.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.680]   That would be a pretty big shift for Apple though,
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.120]   to leave ARM behind and go to scale or whatever Intel is.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.400]   Working on.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.920]   I find this not a credible story, but what do I know?
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.680]   I just don't see the upside.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.320]   I don't see the upside.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.960]   I think Intel could go to them and make a compelling case
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.840]   and say, look, we can sell you these for this incredible price.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.840]   They're way thinner.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.800]   They use less power and they're twice as fast.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:18.720]   Apple does have a development tool chain in place
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.920]   that's relatively architecture independent.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:27.480]   So if there was a very compelling technical case to switch,
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.880]   Apple's done these switches before and they've gone off
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.720]   pretty well.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.600]   It reminds me of the stories.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.760]   And I think it's just a negotiating thing too,
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.960]   where now Apple can go to Samsung and say,
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.400]   well, you should listen to the things Intel's whisper in our ear.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.880]   Apple's in the driver's seat and they get wooed.
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.600]   When you sell 35 million devices, I
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.720]   think you probably have your choice of fast.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.440]   Was there also a story about switching to Intel
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:59.080]   for the flash memory?
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.520]   I thought that that was new too.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.240]   I didn't see the details of it, but that Intel has some kind
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.800]   of new flash memory that's ever thinner and smaller.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.840]   And obviously, if you're selling flash memory,
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.760]   you're going to Apple first.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.320]   Interesting.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.680]   If you want to sell a lot of it.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.720]   We're going to take a break.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.720]   Come back with your picks of the week software hardware.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.440]   Gentlemen, prepare your picks.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.680]   And while you're doing that, Andy has a pick for us.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.760]   I want to tell everybody about, of course,
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.240]   our good friends at audible.com, the ultimate place
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.960]   for buying and listening to audio books.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:37.640]   I'm a huge audible fan, a big audible subscriber.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.480]   As is Andy, as are many of our hosts.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.160]   We just love-- I guess if you're audio focused
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.520]   and if you listen to podcasts, you probably are,
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:46.840]   you really ought to know about Audible.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:51.400]   70,000 plus titles, radio shows, magazines, newspapers,
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.120]   and, of course, the best in fiction, nonfiction, science
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.920]   fiction, help and how to.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.960]   And Andy, I think you've got a pick for us
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.680]   that has to do with a horse.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.400]   Indeed, I do.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.080]   This is something that I've been--
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.360]   every three months, I have been doing a Google search
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.720]   for a secretariat.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.840]   I read, excuse me, an Audible search
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.320]   versus a secretariat because I knew two things.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:18.320]   Number one, the audiobook version of Bill Nack's biography
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:21.120]   of secretariat was going to be an awesome book.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.120]   And two, it was going to be doubly awesome
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.760]   because, of course, he was going to be the narrator himself.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.840]   I've heard Bill Nack is a friend of mine,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:32.320]   and I've heard him talk about this horse, both just
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.120]   like privately, socially, and in front of 500 people
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120]   at a time.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.760]   And this man has such a deep, profound understanding
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.040]   of horse racing in general and this horse in particular.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.120]   And he is a gifted storyteller.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.360]   So the only disadvantage I can talk about--
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.720]   I can say about this audiobook is that it's not narrated
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.000]   by Bill Nack.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.680]   Do go to YouTube and do a search for some of his videos
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.240]   because people have been fortunate enough
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.240]   to be with him as he's telling these stories.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.440]   And he's a wonderful storyteller.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.280]   But he is even in print, though.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.400]   He is just as good a storyteller as he is in person.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.480]   He's spin out.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:11.080]   I've read this.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.280]   It was just released today.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.240]   So I've read the book a couple times in paperback.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.880]   I haven't heard the audiobook.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.200]   But I will tell you that stick with the first couple
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.560]   of chapters because he very, very wisely
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.080]   spends the first chapter turning you
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.280]   into a lover of horse racing.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.840]   And he has to do that by telling you,
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.040]   it's not just about, well, they bought this horse
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.840]   and they chose a jockey and then they went
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.400]   chopping for a hat and a saddle,
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.600]   and then they put him on the race.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.080]   No, it's really about these breeding farms
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.240]   and the families that own them and what the people
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.560]   who make these choices and how they select these horses,
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.920]   how they select the trainers, when they decide
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.520]   that they're ready to go,
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.560]   Secretariat became the property of this farm
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.360]   based on a coin toss, also based on the fact
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.960]   that the person who, the person, one of the people
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.760]   involved in this coin toss to select who gets to buy
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.440]   the next, the next cult from the stable,
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.400]   wanted to lose because she knew that this one,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.760]   this one came from A plus B is equal C,
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.280]   which is gonna be kind of an okay horse,
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.120]   but the next one is going to be A plus D,
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.720]   which could be a spectacular animal.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.720]   - That part of the story is fantastic, I have to say.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.320]   - It really, and there was a movie about it
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.880]   that was very critical. - I saw the movie.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:26.480]   - And it was excellent, but when you actually hear the,
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.640]   we get to the point where Secretariat has had
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.000]   a disappointing start for a very, very simple medical reason,
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.840]   but now he still thought that this could be
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.840]   the one the greatest, not only the greatest horses
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.840]   in history, one of the greatest athletes in history,
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.560]   but now it's time for him to prove it
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.520]   by racing the Triple Crown.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.280]   And Bill really gets, again, I really urge you to
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.920]   hit YouTube and try to hear him tell the story.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.280]   When he tells the story personally of watching this horse
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.080]   win the Triple Crown, you know how it turns out,
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.560]   but you're like, come on, Secretariat, come on, Secretariat.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.440]   - We're now dancing in the aisles at Churchill Downs.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.280]   - Now, how do you know Bill?
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.800]   Is he a writer at the Sun Times or--
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:05.960]   - Turcut, he can't make any--
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.160]   - He's a friend of Roger Ebert's mutual friend.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.720]   And so I first met him about 10 years ago
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.280]   at the Conference on World Affairs in Boulder.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.280]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.360]   - And yeah, no, I'll tell you, he was there from the,
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.080]   he has the official title of Secretary's Biographer
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:20.920]   because he was there at the beginning.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.480]   He was there in the, he was there when Secretariat died.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.720]   And there's a story that he told during,
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.680]   when he was telling the Secretariat story in Boulder
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.560]   a few weeks ago that I hadn't heard before,
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.360]   where he was at the, he was a regular at the stables,
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.120]   and he sees like sort of, Secretariat
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.200]   to sort of like doing this, sort of playing like in the,
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.320]   in the paddock like this, didn't know, came close.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.600]   And he saw that there was like a little bird feather
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.520]   on its nose that was trying to,
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.280]   a fine, the Secretariat finally blew the feather off,
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.560]   it danced around a little while and landed at Bill's feet.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.000]   And he carried that feather in his wallet
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.520]   for years and years and years until he was at a prize fight
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.880]   at Massesburg Garden and someone stole his wallet.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:43:59.720]   - Oh, wow.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:00.640]   - What a story.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.440]   - Yeah, he's, I could tell, I could keep talking
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.280]   and talking about Bill, but again,
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.920]   this is, this is exactly the guy to tell the story of
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.600]   legitimately one of the greatest athletes
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.800]   of the 20th century.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.960]   - Can't wait to read this.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.800]   Thank you for agreeing.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.720]   - Again, I promise you, I had zero,
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.080]   zero interest in horse racing, zero knowledge of horse racing.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.680]   I bought this book only because I had met Bill
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.720]   and really been, I heard some of his stories
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.840]   and been brought, I guess, yeah, I guess I should read this.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.120]   And then again, I am there on a train reading this book.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.600]   I said, come on, come on, okay, he's lost me.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.960]   He's still lost, but it's secretary.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.040]   He's got, oh my God, he's still excelling.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.480]   And I'm like, for God's sake, Andy, it's like, damn, fuck.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.000]   Pull it together.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.840]   - Secretary, what a great choice,
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.800]   but you see the variety and the quality of the books
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.560]   available to you at audible.com.
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.600]   I know our lives are busy these days
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.080]   and for a while kind of got out of reading.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.280]   And, but it was such an important part of my life
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.280]   for years and years and years.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:58.040]   And Audible's brought it back.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.120]   Actually, what brought it back was my long commute
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.400]   to tech TV years ago.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.600]   And the fact that I had to have something
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.760]   to take my mind off the drive,
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.880]   if you've got a long commute, if you go to the gym,
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.880]   I listen to the gym now, I don't have the community more,
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.880]   but I listen to the gym every single day.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.800]   It's a great way to read at the time
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.800]   when you couldn't normally read
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.640]   and get an amazing amount read.
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.280]   I have 500 books now in my Audible Cube.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.040]   Books I've read, enjoyed, and loved over the last 10 years.
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.360]   And this is gonna be 501, Andy, it sounds really great.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.160]   I can't wait to read it, secretary.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.480]   The highest possible recommendation.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.240]   Now you get it free, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.440]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.200]   That's a book a month, first month's free,
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.360]   first book, therefore free.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.120]   And it's yours to keep forever, cancel at any time.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.120]   You still got Secretariat by Bill Knack.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.760]   And, but there's so many other choices
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.400]   if you're not into that.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.040]   It's kind of hard to choose.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.280]   I have a two book a month's plan
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.040]   and I just, you know, I just eat them like candy.

[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.640]   The hair of Breen, your pick of the week.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.960]   - Okay, my pick of the week is HBO Go.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.040]   - Yeah, baby.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:20.440]   - I was recently at a family event and this last week
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.000]   and it kind of held in a rustic place.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.920]   And so there were no televisions in the house
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.000]   but there was wireless internet.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.760]   And so we would do the family stuff
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.800]   and about 8.30 or so.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.720]   That was the end of it.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.920]   And so I still had the rest of the evening to do something.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.080]   And I had downloaded HBO Go before I had left.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:44.000]   And I hadn't quite finished Boardwalk Empire.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.480]   And I love HBO for a couple of shows.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.400]   And I have an HBO subscription because every season
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.800]   there's like two or three shows that I absolutely
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:56.280]   want to watch and it's worth it for me to pay for it.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.880]   So at home I have a direct TV subscription
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:01.760]   and you don't get HBO Go on direct TV
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.640]   but you do get it through this app.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.560]   So I was able to watch on my iPad
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.040]   not only some Ricky Gervais shows
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.280]   but also those last two episodes of Boardwalk Empire.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:14.080]   They have a lot of the older shows there.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.080]   So if you want to go back and watch Deadwood
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.560]   or catch up on shows that you never watched like The Wire,
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:20.600]   I've never been through it.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.120]   And now I'm going to catch up thanks to this app.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:26.120]   It's the video quality is great.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.400]   The interface is really nice.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.040]   And it's just, and it doesn't cost you anything.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:35.000]   If you're already getting HBO and you have an iPad
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.920]   download it for free and you can watch
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.480]   all the HBO programs you like.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.440]   - It may, I kind of understand HBO's strategy
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.560]   'cause they've never really offered shows on iTunes
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.120]   before, very limited shows on iTunes.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.160]   On demand, you never get the whole season.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.400]   You don't get old seasons.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.120]   Obviously they were planning this all along.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.160]   You can also go to HBOGo.com.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.440]   They have it on the web as well.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.920]   - Right, you can get it on your computer as well.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.120]   It's a fabulous bargain.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.880]   You're right, it's frustrating because
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.200]   unlike most other networks where you can go the next day
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:02.800]   and get an episode like Justified for example,
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.840]   I can get that the next day and I love the show
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:05.680]   and so it's great.
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.200]   But HBO, if you miss it and you don't have something like this,
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:11.040]   you have to wait for the DVD set to come out
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.840]   in two years or a year after the sale.
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.640]   Fabulous bargain if you're an HBO subscriber
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.840]   and your TV service is compatible
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.160]   with you, absolutely should get it.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.800]   Brilliant, it's a brilliant move by HBO
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:24.040]   to keep subscribers.
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:24.880]   (laughing)
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.880]   - Oh, is it support airplane?
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.760]   Good question. - Does it work with
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.600]   airplane?
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:31.440]   No, I don't believe it does.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:32.280]   - Ah! - I can get you
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   to watch it on there.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.440]   - For crying out loud.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.280]   - Boo.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.360]   - Hang on, let me try.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.960]   - All right, let's see.
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.440]   Play it to your Apple TV 'cause that would be sweet.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.440]   Although I have to say, and I found this with Netflix
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.480]   and all the streaming apps on the iPad,
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.160]   you don't get the same quality that you would get
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.760]   if you had a Roku attached to your TV or something like that.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.600]   - Right.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.560]   Go on and talk among yourself.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.520]   - Yeah, let's see.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.280]   Oh, wait, I see the AirPlay icon.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.360]   - AirPlay goes. - AirPlay, HBO go, yay.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.920]   You can play it under your Apple TV.
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:01.760]   Lovely.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.680]   Looks like he's got a little Disney movie there,
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.520]   a little DreamWorks coming up there.
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.640]   - It's a little DreamWorks app.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.400]   - It's a DreamWorks, yeah, I'm gonna watch a movie.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.360]   Go ahead, you enjoy yourself, Chris, well,
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.320]   Andy Inako gives us his pick of the week.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.320]   - This is one of my all-time favorite apps for iOS
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.960]   and very timely to, over the weekend,
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.160]   I was moderating panels at the Boston Comic Con
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.160]   and I was able to use an app that I just totally rely
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.000]   on every time I speak.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.480]   It's called Presentation Clock by Sean Welch.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.400]   And it is, it's an app that does one simple thing,
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.760]   but does it flawlessly, perfectly,
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.160]   as well as it possibly can do.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.080]   Its only job is to be a clock for like,
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.240]   when you're doing presentations,
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.320]   to try to time something.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.120]   I've got it on the iPad right now,
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.360]   but basically you set it up by saying,
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.360]   how long do you need to talk?
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.360]   Then you simply tell it that I want the numbers to go
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.080]   at a certain time, I want the numbers to go to yellow,
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.200]   to warn me about them getting close to the end,
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.120]   then go to red at a certain time
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.320]   to tell me that I really need to wind things up.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.760]   You can have it do audible alerts
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.000]   or you can have it remain completely silent.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.080]   I believe, I don't think,
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:16.440]   I haven't used this feature,
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.440]   but I believe you can even set it up
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.000]   so that as the moderator,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.200]   you can have your iPhone running this app,
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.840]   but also controlling an iPad version of this app
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.720]   that the other speakers can see.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.000]   So if you want to tell people,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.280]   by the way, you're 10 seconds,
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.400]   you're 10 minutes starts right now.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.440]   And there is no mistaking this.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.840]   So as I'm giving my talks,
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.560]   I don't have to keep an eye on the clock,
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.360]   it'll just simply my peripheral vision realize,
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.480]   oh, I see yellow,
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.440]   that means that I need to stop talking about
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.520]   how awesome this movie Rango I saw was
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.840]   and start actually getting back to the topic
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.520]   of leveraging XML across multiple domains,
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:55.640]   which is what I'm actually here to start talking about.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.560]   So it's only, it's 99 cents,
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.400]   but as I say,
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.600]   I would almost want to give them 99 cents
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:06.480]   just for writing a perfect app.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.680]   It's not just for presentations too.
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.800]   When I was making Pizzale's,
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.960]   Pizzale cookies a couple of weeks ago,
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.040]   it's also like just the perfect repetitive,
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.440]   I need to count me down a minute and a half
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.800]   and give me warnings when I'm close
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:20.000]   and needing to do something.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:20.840]   - That's great.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.800]   - Time and time and time again.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.280]   I will also say just to sort of stick the knife in
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.720]   at the Boulder conference,
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.240]   there's like four speakers on a panel,
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.960]   we each get this talk for 10 minutes each.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.000]   The guy next to,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.360]   I had my little speaker clock work perfectly wonderfully.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.160]   The guy next to me had a Nexus one,
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.360]   I was trying to use the stopwatch
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.840]   and screwed up on him twice.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.680]   It started beeping and it's in,
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:45.880]   it's Saturday, the stop, wait a minute, hang on.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.720]   So that's,
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.360]   that's I think the greatest advertisement
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.720]   for this app ever.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.120]   So, highest recommendation.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.760]   - Presentation clock by Sean Welch,
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.520]   99 cents on the iOS.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.600]   - 99 cents.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:57.440]   - 99 cents.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.840]   Now John Gruber from Daring Fireball.net,
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.280]   your pick of the week, sir.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.320]   - All right, let me set the stage.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.680]   It's 1991, I'm a freshman
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:07.760]   at Drexel University here in Philadelphia.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.360]   Drexel very Mac oriented school,
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.200]   especially at the time.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.680]   So all the freshmen pretty much,
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.080]   you were supposed to have,
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:14.200]   they couldn't make you buy Mac,
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:16.360]   but they made you buy a Mac.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.080]   Everybody has a Mac.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:20.760]   1991, Ethernet is like a high end.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:23.200]   I mean, consumer Macs didn't come with Ethernet.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.600]   There were no Ethernet jacks in the dormitory.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.400]   Wi-Fi was years away, right?
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.680]   So these are machines that people bought
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.840]   and typically you only communicated
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.440]   via taking a floppy disk out,
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.400]   going to the other machine.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.760]   But you could buy these little dongles,
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:39.800]   I forget what they were called,
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.000]   Adam, I'll bet you remember,
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.560]   but you could put it in the serial port of your Mac
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.960]   and then use phone net, exactly.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.640]   - Phone net, yeah.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.400]   - So for 10 bucks you could get this thing
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.400]   that would plug in the serial port of your Mac.
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.840]   And then you could use, now remember,
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.280]   Ethernet cable way, way, way too expensive at the time.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:59.800]   You'd just use phone cable and you could connect to Macs
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:01.200]   and then you'd have an Apple Talk network.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.040]   - That's right.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.960]   - For 10 bucks a person plus the cost of the phone cable
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.320]   and phone cable is just copper,
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.000]   so you could just get like speaker wire
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.360]   if you wanted to run it down the hall
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.080]   and just twist it together.
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:18.040]   So we got the whole floor of Calhoun Hall wired up with this.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:19.080]   Now why would we do that?
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.320]   Why would we do this?
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.120]   It was to play a game called Spectre.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.520]   Does anybody want to do this game?
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:25.960]   - Tank game.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:27.080]   - It was a tank game.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.480]   Vector graphics.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.320]   - Guess what?
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.040]   It is out for the iPad.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.160]   They have brought it back, 99 cents.
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:38.480]   S-P-E-C-T-R-E, of course,
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.480]   because spelling it that way is way too close.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.920]   - It looks like Andy's got it already.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:43.240]   - Of course.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.560]   (laughing)
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.040]   - All I needed to do was hear the word Spectre
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.600]   and I was sold.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:53.600]   - It is not like somebody who who fights Vector
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.840]   and kind of had a vague recollection
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.800]   of what it was like and they remade it.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.040]   It's like the real deal.
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.520]   I mean, they've got the sounds, it looks right.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.240]   - It looks just like the original.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:04.320]   - 99 cents.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.960]   It's like 99 cents for $99 worth of nostalgia.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.840]   And the controls are actually pretty good
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.520]   for a game that was originally based
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.000]   on having your fingers on the arrow keys
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.160]   and the thumb on the space bar.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:18.640]   The touchscreen controls, I think, are actually pretty good.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:20.000]   - Spectre 3D.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:20.840]   - Got it.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:21.680]   - They call it now.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.840]   - If I bake you, if the developers are out there,
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.200]   I beg you to make it, put it in a Mac App Store.
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:27.040]   Get it running on it.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:27.880]   - Oh, yes.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.120]   - With the keyboard?
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.040]   - Oh, yes.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.400]   - I beg you, I beg you.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.240]   I will link it up.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.880]   I will get people to buy it.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.360]   (laughing)
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.200]   - Wow.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:37.040]   - Very cool.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.360]   - I'm happy this game made me.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.960]   - Oh, I forgot all about that game.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.400]   It's like Battle Zone a little bit.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.240]   - Yeah.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.080]   - And it's very fun.
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.800]   So even if you don't remember playing it back in the day,
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:49.880]   for 99 cents, I'm telling you, it's actually pretty fun.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:50.720]   - Sink the land, fucking.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.720]   - Take a funky player.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.560]   - Yes.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.400]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.920]   Of all the days I chose to not have my dual display iPad.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.720]   - You could have put it up there on the screen.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:01.560]   - Oh, man.
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.520]   - Look at, even Green has it.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.360]   - Oh, I've got it too.
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.200]   I love Spectre.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.760]   - Can we do land party, Spectre, though?
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.600]   - That's what I want.
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.440]   - Yes.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.280]   - Multiplayer.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.120]   - Multiplayer.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:13.960]   - Multiplayer.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:14.800]   - I have Bluetooth.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.640]   - 16 players via internet or wifi.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:17.480]   - Yes.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.280]   - Who needs phone net?
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:21.600]   - Yes.
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.000]   - Wow, that's really cool.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:23.840]   Thank you.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.760]   - Yeah, I showed that to my daughter and said,
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:26.600]   "This is how we used to do this."
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.240]   - This is how daddy used to do it.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:32.840]   - See, this really does show that games for our generation
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:35.320]   is like what music was for previous generations.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.720]   Now they're even doing cover versions of the old kids
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:41.920]   just to get the next step as to rebuy this.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:44.600]   Oh my God, I was in the dorm at Rensselier
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:45.920]   and I remember that.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.080]   - And you can't play it on the iPhone too as well, right?
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.640]   So it's iPad or iPhone.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:55.520]   Wow, what a great app.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:56.600]   How does it play on the iPhone?
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.240]   Does it play on the iPhone?
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.440]   Seems like kind of a natural iPad app.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.360]   - Yeah, I haven't tried it on the iPhone actually,
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.800]   but on the iPad it's traces.
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.480]   I last but not least, Adam Inks, tidbits.com.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.920]   - I was just spending 10 days in Denver and Boulder
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.640]   and relying pretty heavily on Navagon
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:20.040]   while I was there for driving and finding my way around.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.560]   And one of the real problems whenever you use your iPhone
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.360]   as a GPS device is it absolutely sucks battery.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:29.200]   - Yes.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.960]   - And so, you know, it's not a big deal if you're home
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.600]   and you've got battery chargers there,
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:34.880]   your chargers everywhere,
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:37.760]   or you have a car charger that's sort of in a reliable spot
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.520]   and all of that kind of stuff.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.640]   But I didn't have all of that kind of reliable stuff.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:45.160]   And I knew I was gonna need the iPhone
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.960]   to be working at the end of the day every day.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.720]   So this is actually, this is my like success story
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:54.680]   for the Mac world expo speaker swag bag.
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.040]   I'm poking through the bag before I leave
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:00.920]   and I come across this.
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.720]   The Mophie Juice Pack.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.800]   - Oh yeah, baby.
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:06.200]   - And just take the iPhone out of it there.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.000]   You can see two part case just slides right in.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.360]   Yeah, it's a little big, it's a little heavier,
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.560]   but it still slides into my jeans pocket
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:18.560]   and I did not run on a battery once on the trip.
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.960]   And they say it virtually doubles the battery life.
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:24.080]   That was more than enough for, you know,
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.880]   60 to 90 minutes of GPS use a day
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.680]   along with everything else I was doing,
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.800]   including being in a couple of wacky cell service areas
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.640]   where the iPhone was really haunting.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.560]   So if you're in a situation where you're,
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:39.400]   maybe you don't need it normally, but on a trip
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.960]   where you don't know you're gonna be able to get
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.760]   to power regularly, the Juice Pack Air
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.360]   just totally saved my butt.
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:48.560]   Another one, Saturday I was participating
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:51.880]   in a 77 mile relay race around Seneca Lake.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.840]   Same thing, I knew I was gonna be needing the GPS.
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.800]   I was gonna have the phone on all day and dodgy spots.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:00.400]   And at the end of the day, I needed to guarantee
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.840]   that I had the phone working in case I ended up
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.960]   in a place where I didn't know how to get home from.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:08.600]   So, you know, Juice Pack Air meant that I had a, you know,
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:11.440]   a good chunk of battery left at the very end of the day.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:13.560]   It's about what, 90 bucks?
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.520]   79.95 for the Juice Pack Air, 99 for the Juice Pack Plus,
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:22.160]   which is a little bit more, it's a 2000 milliamp hour battery
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.480]   versus a 1700 milliamp hour battery
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.280]   for just a tiny bit more weight.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.000]   So if you're really concerned about it,
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.720]   I'd probably go for the Juice Pack Plus.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.000]   I don't think I'd use it on a daily basis, you know,
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.960]   and I don't when I'm home, but when I was traveling
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.920]   or on the say this relay race where I was out
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.920]   and about all day long and needed to,
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:45.440]   the phone to absolutely work, that was the saving grace.
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:48.120]   - I agree, love my Juice Pack.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.960]   - And I also think I have the same one I can vouch for it.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:52.600]   I wouldn't go to a conference without it.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:54.480]   I don't need it, never need it on a regular day.
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.240]   And every time I go to a conference
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:00.120]   and I'm screwing around on my phone all day,
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.520]   sucking on the wifi, Juice Pack Air,
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.200]   I never have a problem getting through the day with it.
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.280]   - Juice Pack Air, it also has this little straw in back.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:08.840]   (laughing)
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.400]   - It's not a Juice Box.
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:11.640]   (laughing)
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:15.360]   You know, it's the one thing that I still go back
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.360]   to the iPhone when I'm gonna be in those situations
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:19.120]   'cause there are no Android phones
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.840]   with that kind of backup battery pack.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:24.440]   - Oh, you mean that even though there's so many of them?
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.680]   - Oh, it's gonna make a case.
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:28.240]   Nobody's gonna make a case for them.
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:31.640]   But the iPhone, there's one, and so it's easy to do.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.560]   Yeah, Muffie's done a good job all along with these.
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.560]   And I know that's a brilliant little fix.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:37.560]   Yeah, I'm gonna order a plus pack.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.120]   Hey, what a great show this has been.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.000]   I wanna thank you all.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.800]   Chris Breen is the MacDaddy@macworld.com.
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:44.880]   (laughing)
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.560]   What's what we call him?
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.400]   - No.
[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:48.240]   - You seem to think I'd have to respond to that.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:50.160]   - You can't deny it, Chris, sorry.
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:53.840]   - No, that came from the, wow, Tech TV days.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:58.840]   - Yeah, ZD TV is where you bestow that honor.
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:01.480]   - I was laughing 'cause it seemed like he was trying
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.080]   to keep a straight face through that.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:06.080]   (laughing)
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.560]   It could only last about a second.
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:08.400]   - Can't do it.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.240]   - Yeah.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.080]   Hey, thank you, Chris, for being here.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.440]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:12.280]   - Thank you, Liam.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.320]   - I actually thank Andy for putting this panel together.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.320]   I wasn't sure if I was gonna be here today, Andy.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.160]   Stepped into the breach and did a great job
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:20.640]   of assembling perhaps the three,
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:22.960]   in addition to himself, the three best journalists
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.640]   on the max side that we could imagine.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.880]   - I will underscore that, although I, usually,
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:31.360]   I pick these guys 'cause I know it'll be a great show
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.240]   with them, if I'm supposed to be hosting,
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.320]   but in retrospect, I'm real like, wait, no,
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:37.360]   that means if the show sucks, it can't possibly
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.720]   be because of the gas, it must be because of the heat.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.400]   (laughing)
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.240]   - I deal with that every day, Andy,
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:46.120]   and you just have to get used to sucking.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.200]   Andy and Ico does not--
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:48.800]   - I have never shown title, yes.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:50.720]   (laughing)
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:51.880]   - Just get used to sucking.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:54.600]   Andy is the main in charge of technology coverage
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.440]   at the Chicago Sun Times, and of course his blog
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.640]   is www.cwob.com, and follow him on Twitter
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:00.720]   and Flickr and everywhere else.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.760]   I-H-N-A-T-K-O, thank you, Andy.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.320]   We'll see you next week.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:09.160]   John Gruber is Mr. Daring Fireball,
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.840]   DaringFireball.net, one of the most opinionated
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:14.760]   and usually the most well-informed
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.960]   Mac columnist and bloggers out there.
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.320]   A must read for anybody who follows Mac news
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.800]   as everybody knows, and if you don't, go get it.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:24.680]   Did we miss spell John as Che-O-N, isn't it?
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.520]   - No. - No?
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:26.960]   - No, I paid for the H.
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:27.800]   (laughing)
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:30.600]   - Hey, thanks for being here, John.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:32.000]   We really appreciate it.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:32.840]   Really appreciate it.
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:34.040]   - Thank you, I enjoyed it.
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:35.760]   - Always fun to have you on, and of course,
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:40.240]   finally Mr. Adam Inksst from titbits.com,

[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:46.360]   started really in the earliest days of the Mac
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:47.840]   and Tush, and it's still going strong.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:51.880]   T-I-D-B-I-T-S.com, Adam, great to have you too.
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:52.840]   - Anytime, Leo.
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.000]   - Thanks for being here, everybody.

[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:04.800]   It is fun to watch live, but of course,
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.520]   you don't have to because we then offer both the audio
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.560]   and the video high and low quality on iTunes
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.240]   and everywhere else you can find podcasts
