[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.320]   Joining us Renee Ritchie from Montreal where he is quickly cranking out yet another YouTube video on his Renee Ritchie channel.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.220]   Hello Leo. Actually, we're freshly back on quote unquote lockdown as of today.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.520]   Well, no, as of Thursday, I think.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   Oh, it's coming back.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.120]   It turns out not doing anything about it didn't work.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.620]   So now we're going to try to do something again.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.520]   Andy Nacos also here.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.620]   He's locked down so badly he can't go across the street to his favorite restaurant.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.020]   I can.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.720]   I just don't want to, especially if I've got a drone that can carry a breakfast sandwich and or one of the premium bakery donuts that they may go on the weekends.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.620]   I'm just awesome.
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.420]   It's just it would say.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.620]   I don't even need a drone.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.520]   Because I could just do like a like one of those clothes lines on a bad.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.120]   And I'm sure you could arrange that.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.220]   I am glad I don't live across the street from a store that has donuts.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.620]   So I'm just I'm very glad that they only have them on weekends because they're not.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.720]   They're not just like, oh, we bought a donut machine.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.420]   It's like there is like if you were to name one of like the two or three best donut bakeries like in the state, they like make a spike.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.520]   They make a special trip out and they pick up like three dozen from the.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.920]   And so the rule is one a week only Saturday morning, only one a week.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   Otherwise it would be all the donuts all the time.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   No, this is why quarantine's been bad for my diet because I know it's in the, you know, I know there's a refrigerator 10 feet away with all sorts of treats in there.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.020]   And I just I have no impulse control.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.620]   If I had a if I had a breakfast sandwich across the street from me, I'd eat it.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.220]   Yeah, I had a move.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.620]   Yes.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:04:00.520]   My I I I'm I don't I won't derail this completely, but they I will say that I've I started off by saying after like one month into lockdown saying, you know what, we just need some like a marker every single week to donate that end of the week and something just to look forward to like.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.820]   So how about like we normally don't get takeout pizza, but we'll have like takeout pizza every Friday night, right?
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.220]   And then we'll we'll remove that restriction and now we're up to I get to get takeout pancakes from the diner every Monday morning.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.620]   I get to have a donut every Friday every Saturday morning and like now this and so September was the month.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.420]   I really had to do an audit and say that, okay, you know that you know that that that that hoegy that we said that we're going to get every Wednesday.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.820]   We're not going to do that anymore.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.820]   Yeah, we're not going to do it.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.820]   I do Wednesday's shower day and that's all you know really mark demarcates the week.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   Lori Gill is also here managing editor at I'm or dot com.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.220]   She's got deadlines.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.020]   So she doesn't need a calendar.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.820]   She knows right.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.020]   Yes, I know exactly.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.420]   Yeah, great to have you all here.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.220]   I'm going to ask because it's Tuesday and we're a week away from the first Tuesday in October.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.020]   Any invitations in the mail?
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.020]   I think next week.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.020]   I think we'll get them next week.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.420]   You don't think it's going to be the eighth.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.620]   I mean, it's the sixth of the 13th.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.820]   Think of whatever it is.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.420]   Okay.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.220]   Well, you guys all heard that prime day is also on the 13th and 14th, right?
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.620]   That's going to be kind of a crazy day.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.020]   Don't die, Lori.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.820]   Please don't die.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.820]   I know it's good.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.420]   I'm going to be up.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.020]   You're going to be up all night because who who I turned out an opportunity to get 80 cents off a street, a string of LED string lights.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.620]   That's right.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.820]   Here's your opportunity all year for this chance.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.620]   Yeah, I ignore intentionally ignore a prime day because I feel like I'm getting scammed.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.020]   I don't know how I just know I am.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.020]   There deals there.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:53.340]   You just have to you have to like subscribe to the right, like mailing lists or the right Reddit groups or the right Twitter feeds to say, oh, by the way, they somehow they snuck in a really good deal on this blue.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.340]   Ray box that or actually this Bluetooth speaker is really well reviewed and it's legitimately 50% off.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.140]   But yeah, yeah, you got to know what you're doing.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.940]   Let's see.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.340]   And by invitations, you mean we'll we'll hear that there's an event that we can attend via our browser.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.940]   But then so that's one reason they don't actually they could still be having it on October 6th.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.540]   They don't have to tell you to at a time, right?
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.940]   How how early did the notice come for last event a week a week?
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.940]   OK, so maybe we're sticking to that and unlike Comic Con Los Angeles Comic Con, I don't think apples anywhere nearly as reckless as to try to do a physical event.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.740]   Oh, gosh.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.940]   How did that go?
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.660]   They haven't done it.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.140]   They announced it for December cosplay in the masks.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.340]   No, no, no guests have signed up.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.740]   So it's basically con comics fans get to hang out with other comics fans, which has anybody.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.740]   Any time any message board knows is that doesn't always go well.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.940]   Well, there's plenty to talk about.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.640]   We on Sunday, I tried to make Twitter as long as possible.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.340]   We were waiting for the judges decision.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:18.540]   But as long as I waited, I was reading the thread live on Twitter and it was just it was like watching a really slightly angry, slightly disappointed, really like just like parent talking to.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.340]   Talking to two kids, like no, no, Timmy, you knew that was his bagel.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.940]   No, no other Timmy, no other Timmy, you know that you weren't allowed to put that there.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.540]   That's actually the role of the judicial system in our country.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.740]   They're the parental figures.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:43.540]   So the judge ordered the put a stay on the TikTok ban.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.740]   What do we have to say about that?
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.340]   Anything?
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:08:11.540]   First again, opening salvo, something that's going to get really, really complicated because the as the question that's been on everyone's minds to begin with is that on what authority does the government have the ability to simply ban an app without without basically pulling in all that of legislators.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.140]   The judge pointed to due process, basically.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.540]   There's no due process.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.140]   You can't just say, I don't like it.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.140]   He by the way, the opinion was issued under seal for some reason.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.940]   I don't know why.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:41.740]   So we, you know, we couldn't read his judicial reasoning, but he did say during the hearing, the Trump administration ban as structured could be considered quote a fairly significant deprivation end quote of the companies due process rights.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.740]   That's, you know, the least of it.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.140]   But yeah, you can't just decide.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.540]   Well, I think it's Chinese.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.540]   So I think it's bad.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.740]   So we're going to ban it.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.940]   You can't just give money to your friend.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.740]   I think is the thing.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.340]   It's like, I think, I think Larry deserves a few million dollars.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.340]   We'll just whip this up so that Larry can have that money.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.940]   You think that's.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.740]   Well, let's not be hasty.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.140]   How much do you donate to the campaign?
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.740]   A lot.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.340]   Is it a neck?
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.140]   Is it a neck?
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.540]   Neck.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.140]   So doing a fundraiser.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.740]   Was any of that earlier this month.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:18.100]   The Commerce Department, which I'm assuming at this point is just is acting at the president's behest, said that tick
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:25.140]   tock downloads would be banned on September 20th and that further restrictions would go in effect November 12th.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.540]   Basically, those further restrictions would eliminate tick.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.220]   You wouldn't be able to you could stop tick tock on your phone, but it would block tick tock internet traffic.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.220]   At which point you could have it on your phone, but you wouldn't see anything.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.140]   Commerce delayed the initial.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:51.300]   This is so confusing to lay the initial deadline last weekend when Oracle stepped forward with little help from Walmart to acquire between
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.540]   the two and 20% of tick tock and the president gave it his tentative.
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.980]   Like it sounds all right to me, but I got to check into it.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.180]   Approval.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.100]   There was no deal memo.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.100]   There was no, I mean, there was no detail at all except that, you know, we're going to do this.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.420]   And the education fund like they have five billion dollar education.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.140]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:19.940]   Yeah. Plus the unclear, by the way, whether that five billion would come from Oracle's pocket or TikTok's pocket.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.420]   They would this was how it was.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.700]   The government's pocket.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.660]   This is how fuzzy the whole thing was.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.420]   It's like, yeah.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:34.380]   Well, and in fact, I think that the TikTok's thinking not this was approved by anybody was, we'll do an IPO of this new TikTok global.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.820]   And we will take five billion from the money raised from the IPO and give that to the president.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:46.140]   I'm sorry, not the president, the Treasury Department on behalf of the president.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.380]   And then, and then, but I think that was TikTok's understanding.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   I don't think it was the president's understanding.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.700]   But anyway, no, it's completely unclear.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.220]   The deal is just kind of floating around.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:09.900]   So the judge, well, I guess the judge now by saying that in the Commerce Department, by the way, said they would comply and notice TikTok is still on the app store.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:23.220]   The commerce also said our order is fully consistent with the law and promotes legitimate national security interest, which, by the way, could very well be, you know, and the government's going to vigorously defend its.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:30.420]   The algorithm is the biggest danger, like probably more so than the data and they totally took that off the table like weeks ago.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.780]   And nobody even mentioned it.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.380]   Nobody blinked.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.020]   That's because no one has said what the danger is.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.020]   So there's we've talked about this.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.540]   I'm trying to break it down on my head.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.620]   There's two, I would say presumptive dangers.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.060]   One is that the Chinese government could use the data.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.740]   TikTok has about its users somehow.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.580]   They could say to TikTok, hey, I want to know where Leo LePort lives.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.660]   That's one danger.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.420]   Like a social graph of American or make a social graph.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.700]   The other danger is that they would use it.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.140]   And actually, this seems more likely, but anyway, they would use is a propaganda arm, kind of a radio free China.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.300]   In any event, it's going to it's there still be a trial.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.860]   This is a temporary injunction.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:15.380]   Two things, by the way, Facebook has been caught doing, but they are in no way being regulated.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.820]   We're just targeting a company, not a business practice.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.580]   Well, that's a question I might ask you all.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.780]   It's one thing to give it to the Chinese government, it presumed, I don't want to say enemy, but but but opponent.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:32.460]   Another thing to give it to an American company, Facebook, but from the point of view of the end user.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.100]   Just protect me from everybody.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.020]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:45.940]   And Facebook could be used to propagandize not just by the Chinese government, by the Russian government, by anybody who wants to.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.180]   Facebook has been weaponized.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.140]   They have been sad. Yeah, they've been caught doing that manipulating our whole not their newsfeed.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:58.300]   Not only that, but revelations just a couple of days ago about at least in the 2016 elections about how.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:07.100]   Operatives of one party, shall we say, we're using targeted ads to basically say, where there are some people that we want to encourage to vote.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.140]   There are some demographics that we want to discourage to vote.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.660]   So we're going to target ads specifically to basically keeps one group of people at home.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.660]   Another group of people coming in through rain and sleep in dark of night.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:27.580]   But this whole thing is kind of a mess because the government needs to outline specific reasons other than, well, they're a Chinese company because it would appear that tick.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:35.100]   It's it's not true that just because a company is based in China that they are doing the whims of the Chinese government.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   Also, Tic Toc seems seems to be.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:47.620]   Taking the same stance that every single other social media company that has a presence and has a worldwide presence, including China has, which is to all their Chinese.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.780]   Users, their data is on a server inside China.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:14:00.260]   We're subject to Chinese Chinese government control all international, all other than Chinese users are on a server that's actually in Virginia, I think, but outside of China.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:10.820]   So that they this data is outside of the direct purview of the government that every single social media company wants to at least exert some control over because.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:18.300]   Yeah, there is their internal security laws mean that they could do anything to any server that's actually based on their entire data.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:25.900]   But really, it seems as though most of what China is interested in is making sure they're keeping tabs on their own citizens and we could have problems with that.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:32.620]   But that's a totally separate issue from thinking that just because Tic Toc is owned by a company that's based in China, they must be a security threat.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.660]   And therefore, we're going to use questionable legal authority to shut them down.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.220]   My big problem with the whole thing is it has nothing to do with security.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.420]   It has nothing to do with anything.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.300]   It's security theater.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   If you if look, I'm nobody denies.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:57.340]   I think it's very clear that we are in a little bit of a kind of, I don't know, what kind of economic and propaganda struggle.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:03.580]   And I'm talking about our relationship with China in a struggle with China over a number of things.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.460]   You know, there are human rights record with the Uighur Muslims.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:14.980]   They're Belt and Road Initiative, which is attempting to assert its soft power, its economic hegemony over much of the world.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.540]   Nothing that we would ever do.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:31.380]   And, you know, so there and perhaps even as a kind of hot opponent with cyber warfare, I don't think that there anybody reasonably thinks the Chinese are going to invade our shores or anything like that.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.100]   But there, you know, there clearly there's tensions there.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:43.820]   It seems to me the kinds of tensions that will require a lot of strategic thinking and diplomacy and negotiation and long term thinking.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:16:01.780]   And so it seems like banning an app is the silliest way to address something that is much more complex and in fact has no relationship with any of the issues that we're really struggling with with China, except that it might piss them off, which is exactly like.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:15.300]   That's that's that's that's one of the biggest bumbers because it's like this is this wins nothing for the United States doesn't make us safer, doesn't make us more free, doesn't hand doesn't tackle any sort of a human rights problem that we are taking issue with.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:23.180]   It is simply a fight just to assert the just to create the PR that we're being that some of us are being parents.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.740]   And as opposed to the actual reality of thinking about this, it's a shake down to.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.220]   Right.
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:30.580]   Exactly.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:48.740]   The government has the Chinese government has also said basically made their annoyance very heavily known that this is this is a power grab so that an American company can buy equity in a very successful Chinese company basically steal equity away from a Chinese company, which obviously they can take an issue with.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:58.980]   That's just and that's why the Chinese government said, well, you can't have the algorithm because and just as we have done right in the past, these that is of of real, perhaps even military value.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.900]   So you can't have that, but you can have the assets of the company because it's just freaking ticktock.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.460]   Who cares?
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.420]   Right.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.300]   Oh, you want an app?
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.740]   Okay.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.100]   Fine.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.420]   I have to think it was a security thing.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.420]   So like, how can you proceed with this as a security thing?
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   If you're if you're just if you don't even acknowledge that it's like the algorithm off the table, right?
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.060]   If that's the security issue, because we don't even know what the issue is.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.860]   It's really like a theater with one actor not on stage.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:29.140]   You've got you've got a guy playing three dimensional chess president, she in China and we're playing tic-tac-toe.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.820]   And it's just it's silly.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.620]   It's a waste of energy all around.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:47.740]   This is one of the more annoying things that the more I read about how the government works or excuse me, when it's when it's working working well, it's that there are the people who come and go, the people who are elected and are not elected or come out of term limits.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:59.100]   But then behind the scenes across the street from the White House, across the street from the Congress, there's always been here are here's the office where the people who have been at this job and folk.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:06.180]   And I'm focusing just on this issue of Chinese American economic relations for 10, 20, 30 years.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:12.420]   And when someone new comes on board, they learn from experience of 10, 20, 30 years of experience in this job.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:21.260]   And so when the when the government official who has the power to create policy needs information saying, Hey, I'm really concerned about tic-tac.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.900]   What will be the repercussions if we were to make a move against this company?
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:31.580]   Someone with 10, 20, 30 years with their experience can say, I can tell you, here is the book. Here is exactly how this is going to play out.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.740]   You can fast forward to the very end because we will tell you exactly what will happen about this.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:42.860]   But then when you have administration and Congress people who are saying, well, we're we're those people are like part of the swamp.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.380]   They're part of the establishment.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:50.980]   We can make our own our own decisions without the benefits of 10, 20, 30 years of experience in exactly this issue.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.420]   This is the brain drain.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:19:03.460]   It's just as I mean, it's as damaging when when Apollo 17 launched and 3,000 people at NASA who knew exactly how to run a two week long space mission were fired.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.780]   And they lost all that experience.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.580]   It's also in any institution.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:16.060]   The most valuable asset is if you've been around for 10, 20, 30 years, the knowledge of how the world works and how to run this business, you don't want that knowledge to go away.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:23.420]   There's also collateral damage and there's a great piece in this trajectory. It's unfortunately, it's behind the paywall on St.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   Techery. Ben Thompson talking about widget Smith, David Smith, who is an independent iOS developer and created once widgets were available on iOS 14, created a widget was first out.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.140]   By the way, he hit, you know, he got it out the day iOS 14 came out last week.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.060]   Put out an app that let you create your own widgets. It's a really great app.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:55.020]   And it was thanks to TikTok, a really great app from probably a lesser known developer.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.380]   Although apparently he's done 59 iOS apps today.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.940]   He's a machine. He's a machine.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:07.260]   But thanks to TikTok, it suddenly is a huge.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.340]   Your iOS 14 home screen aesthetic AF.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.460]   A static as AF. This is how you do it.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:23.100]   So this Tiktucker, Katamoggs, has millions of followers.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.620]   This actually got tens of millions of views.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:32.740]   And all of a sudden, widget Smith is the number one app and has been the number one app on the App Store ever since.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:40.780]   And completely do. I mean, we talked about it on iOS today, but we don't have Katamoggs cloud.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:46.100]   Completely because of TikTok.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.580]   And now dozens of YouTube videos, too.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.980]   It's like it went, I don't know what the right word for viral is in 2020 because I feel like we shouldn't use that anymore.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.260]   I don't know what it. Yeah.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.220]   What we should call it.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.900]   It blew up.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.340]   It blew up like it was all over TikTok and then everyone else starts making it and then everyone trend jacks.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.820]   And so there was tons of YouTube videos, like by really big YouTubers as well.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.580]   And it just went everywhere.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.700]   And that's sort of the power of social when it helps the developer.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.620]   And by the way, that's one of the points Ben makes is this is when the App Store,
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:23.100]   this is the kind of the vision of the App Store that Apple has, which is some little independent developer.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.940]   Doesn't have to worry about distribution costs.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.620]   Doesn't have to worry about anything but making a great widget and suddenly, you know, profit.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.060]   Like the server didn't go down the second, the third person downloaded it and then all of that potential income went down the drain.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.060]   Right.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:45.340]   Ben, by the way, poo poo's that notion because, of course, the internet was really introduced zero cost distribution.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.100]   But the internet doesn't scale.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.580]   I mean, Twint, remember Twint would take down websites when you'd introduce an app a few years ago.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:52.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.860]   And during fireball would take down websites.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.100]   Yeah, that's right. We used to call it.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.540]   There is.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.340]   You've been twitted.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:57.860]   Yes.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.820]   But army would take down a website that we can't take down websites anymore.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.620]   That's such a bummer.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.100]   Well, you trained them better.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.860]   Leo, you trained.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.820]   He does sites.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.100]   And first of all, they just didn't have them back then.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:21.580]   So on the other hand, as as John Gruber pointed out, and daring fireball, even though Widget Smith was clearly the hit, Apple somehow allowed a
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:33.980]   widget Smith dash color widgets to be on the app store and steal a huge amount of momentum from the real deal.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.340]   The ripoff app.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.540]   Hi,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.180]   You're in search.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.300]   According to Gruber, the ripoff app.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:48.780]   It's gone now, by the way, had 25 five star ratings, one written review, which says that thanks developer for making such a great app, especially for iOS 14.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.740]   The whole thing is a ripoff.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:58.780]   And Apple, you know, actually eventually pulled it down after, but after only after John Gruber wrote about it.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.140]   This is a constant problem with the app store is you search for something.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.060]   And the thing you're looking for is at the bottom of a long list of clones.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:21.020]   But if you start, if you start blaming Apple for, for, you know, like bad, bad apps getting into the app store, you, you're kind of like walking into this danger zone where you want Apple to curate the app store for you.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.220]   Very specifically, but you also want developers to have the freedom to do what they want.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:34.140]   And if Apple is going in and hand picking every single app that makes it into the app store, then, you know, you're kind of you're stuck there.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:44.540]   The Apple can't necessarily know that widget Smith was the, the first one and that widget Smith dash color options or whatever it was was not.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:55.860]   And so you're, you know, you have to like, it's like, it's, it's, you know, it's owning a, it's owning a boutique where everybody goes in and sells their products.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.300]   And you don't, you're not the one who's picking what does or doesn't go in.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:12.420]   You're just making sure that what does go in is, you know, good quality or in some circumstances is coming in so fast that you don't even notice that it's good quality and you let it slip through because you've got so much going on.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:19.300]   And as you were, I think you're starting to say, Renee, which it's Smith, the phony was the top search result.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:19.860]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.540]   Not the real.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.660]   And I think Groobers Point, I think Groobers Point was the Bunko squad.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.580]   Like one of the grievances, like I think there's a lot of silly grievances and a lot of real ones on the app store.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:35.820]   And one of the ones I think is really real is that for the 30% that Apple is taking, they are not often providing the service, maybe not often.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.940]   It's hard, but they're not always providing the service that should come with that.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:47.700]   And Groober calls it the Bunko squad and David Barnard has been talking about this for years where there are apps that are legally should not be there.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:54.860]   And, you know, certainly apps that degrade the quality of the store and provide bad results for customers.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.580]   And Apple's whole thing is the app store is supposed to create a better experience.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.140]   That's why they fight so hard to maintain control over it.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.260]   And when things like this happens, it just shatters confidence and faith in the system.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:11.260]   And I think they should be hyper-visual and especially in iOS launch times because it costs real people real money.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:17.460]   He says there should be an app store Bunko squad that says, no, you can't, you can't.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.460]   We should be filled with a microphone. You can't talk here.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.820]   You can't talk to my search results.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.820]   Move that out.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:34.460]   The way I prefer to think of it is that if you're paying the mob protection money, if some if some punk breaks the window of your store, that should be the very last time that happens to any store on that block.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.020]   I mean, you're not you're not happy.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.420]   You're being shaken down, but you're expecting the mob to come through for you.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.380]   You can't trust the mob.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.900]   At least if you shake me down.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.420]   You should stick.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.300]   What am I paying you for?
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   Except for not having my store set fire to and my dog.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.940]   We did not say we would prevent other people from breaking your window just so we wouldn't do it.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.460]   Just to be clear, it's in the fine print.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.060]   I don't I'm sure Apple's a little embarrassed.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.740]   I'm sorry. You can take a look at that agreement.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.180]   We you read the binding arbitration.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:08.980]   It's right.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.980]   It's right.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.980]   It's no question of my mind.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.860]   The thing where it's hard is that app store search has been criticized rightly for years.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:22.700]   This is not new technology doing things like nearest neighbor and figuring out what you know what has high attachment.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.340]   All of the stuff Google figured out a decade ago and most of the stuff is public domain now.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:33.740]   And yet Apple still has these weird hodgepodge searches that don't don't provide good results for people.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.540]   I mean, they've got misspellings now that took forever to handle like basic misspellings.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.500]   But it still is not a good search engine.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.420]   And it should be one of the best search engines in the world.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:51.180]   Groupers best line is if Apple ran a food court like they ran the app store, they let a McDowell's open two stores down from McDonald's.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.540]   I didn't know about McDowell's.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.740]   That's it from coming to America reference.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   There you go.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   Good.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.740]   Good deep cut there.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.460]   All right.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.820]   So tick tock.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.460]   We've now covered tick tock the app store.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.060]   Widget Smith.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.180]   I think this show is done.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.660]   Thank you very much for joining us.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.940]   I thought when you mentioned court, I thought you were talking about the epic.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.900]   Probably yesterday.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.940]   I was just reading through it.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.500]   Watching the judge just smack these people.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.140]   Oh, that's the parental.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.140]   Like parental thing.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.500]   All right.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.140]   Well, let's talk about the Rebel Alliance.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.420]   What is the name that they should have called them.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:32.860]   They're not.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.900]   They're not the Rebel Alliance fighting for the rights of the people.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.860]   These are coalitions for app fairness.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:45.980]   These are a group of billionaires who are angry at trillionaires for not making it easier for them to become the trillionaires and just want to use us differently.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:51.580]   Yeah, it was it was it was kind of like hard to watch.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:28:00.940]   It was a real cringe sort of thing where the judge was like motion after like point after point after point saying, yeah, but that's that's not what you did.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.300]   And okay, yeah, but you're saying that is because of rightness and and valuateness.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.980]   But you asked for this fight and now you're complaining that you got the fight that you asked for.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.620]   Or is it okay?
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:16.860]   You're complaining about security, but that's not it's it's it's hard to think that they got anything.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:27.300]   The only piece of remotely good news that I could pick apart from the entire hearing was that the judge a doesn't want to can't can't hear this until July of next year.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:33.500]   And secondly, she is inclined to make this like a jury proceeding so that if it's.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:33.820]   Exactly.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.700]   No, exactly.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   No, exactly.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.700]   I'm not even joking.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:46.820]   It's like if it were just based on here is a judge who knows what the law is and basic and has a really good view on here is what is here is what the court is supposed to be used.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.380]   For and here's what it's not supposed to be used for.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:59.380]   This was not a good day for epic if it's all but if they can still convince random people who are not tech people that hey, let me tell you about freedom.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.500]   Let me tell you about the ability to start.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.420]   So you're saying that really the Empire pretending to be the rebel alliance.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:12.020]   No, but the worst part was the way they judge call for the second part of the trial and the epic lawyer actually says out loud.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.020]   Well, I didn't do so well in that first part.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.020]   She said the quiet part out loud.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   So this is we should give her credit.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.020]   You got to own it at some point.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.220]   This is Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:32.420]   Here is a quote from CNN.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.020]   You did something.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:38.020]   You lied about it by omission by not being forthcoming.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.620]   That's the security issue.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.220]   That's the security issue.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:49.220]   There are a lot of people in the public who consider you guys heroes for what you guys did, but it's still not honest.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.220]   You know, how spanked.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.220]   And that was one of the nicer ways to put it.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   Judge Roberts according to CNN was not particularly persuaded by ethics.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:09.220]   That's a nice way to put it by ethics argument that Apple bundled its app store and in that payment system together in violation of any trust law.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.220]   She also said she did not necessarily agree with Epic that Apple has harmed its ability to distribute Fortnite.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.220]   Wald Gardens said the judge.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:25.220]   Remember we said when we learned it was Judge Gonzalez, we said that, you know, this is going to be, she's not a fool.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   She understands this stuff.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.220]   No, not at all.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.220]   Wald Gardens, she said, have existed for decades.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.220]   She clearly knows, understands what's going on here.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.220]   Nintendo has had a Wald Garden.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   Sony has had a Wald Garden.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.220]   Microsoft has had a Wald Garden.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.220]   What Apple is doing is not much different.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.220]   It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.220]   She understands it better than the US Congress.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.220]   It's kind of remarkable.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.220]   Not even joking about that.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.220]   I have a deep knowledge of it.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.220]   My opinion is just that I don't know necessarily that Epic has a case.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   I think that it's worthwhile to at least have the argument that this is what the industry does.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.220]   This is an industry practice has not always carried water with a judge.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.220]   We were coincidentally, we're talking about coming to America, Art Buckwald.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:23.500]   I forget what the origins of the case were, but someone, one of the writers sued based
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.300]   on Hollywood accounting saying that, well, look, you're telling me that this movie that
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:33.540]   has grossed $1.8 billion according to their own PR, the studio's own PR company, according
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:40.460]   to the net profit that I have been issued, I have made 18 cents on this over 15 years.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.140]   The defense that the studio has provided was, well, this is a standard practice.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.900]   And the judge said, yeah, but your standard practice is crap.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.540]   You're going to have to come up with another idea.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.260]   So I've always thought that was worthwhile to have this into standard industry practice
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.060]   at least tested in court for someone, again, maybe a little bit more agile than Epic to
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.500]   make the argument that perhaps there needs to be some more flexibility in this model.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.780]   But that doesn't necessarily mean that they would even win that argument.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:12.780]   But I've wanted this sort of discussion just so that we can say that look, this concept
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:18.900]   has had its day in court because I am troubled by parts of the way that these industries
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.900]   are run.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:27.060]   I'm pleased to hear that Google has announced that for Android 12, they're going to make
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.700]   it easier to make users hook up to different app stores.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.860]   They're still insisting on Google's payment systems for things that go to the Play Store.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.940]   But I do think that the opening up of a device to alternative app stores is something that
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.140]   could benefit users greatly.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.780]   And so again, I welcome at least the legal argument to say that to put some pressure
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.180]   on Apple to say, here is why we are forcing everybody to buy all of their software from
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.300]   our store and making it impossible for people to use software from any other store.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:04.900]   By the way, the second completely independent reference to the 1988 movie coming to America,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.700]   and they say the universe is random.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.820]   But we played all this.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.580]   We do two hours of rehearsals for every half hour of the show.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.780]   How can you come back to coming to America?
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.780]   Let's think about it.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.020]   But who called it alleged that Paramount stole the idea.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.860]   They said, well, we don't owe you anything.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.100]   They don't know net profit, even though it made $288 million.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.900]   They gave them $900,000, which I think is a fair price.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.340]   I mean, that's a column.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.340]   So, you know.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.340]   But they do that all the time.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.940]   They always make a new company that then leases back on the app that's in the main companies.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   So clever.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.460]   It's so, so clever.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.340]   So here's the real question.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.780]   By the way, the judge said, I prefer a jury trial.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:50.980]   So however sophisticated the judge might be, it does throw everything up in the air because
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   the jury trial.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.220]   The also offered escrow and Apple said yes and Epic is like, no, no, this money that we
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.820]   walked away from, we want it.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.940]   Well, I don't know if they're going to get it.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:07.460]   She also says that given her schedule, the case won't go to trial till July of next year.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.780]   So a jury trial in July, perhaps the judge skeptical.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.140]   But the judge is not the Batman we wanted or needed.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.860]   Well, that's the problem, isn't it?
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.020]   It's not that the app.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:26.060]   So that's the question I guess I wanted to ask, which is did she say this diminished
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:34.020]   the app store in any way or just merely that Epic isn't the right person to pursue this?
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.300]   She said, finding an Epic's behavior.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.180]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.380]   This is Apple's lawyer.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.380]   Never mind.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.420]   I think Epic was asking for a lot of relief, all of which were completely denied.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.780]   And gave and basically gave the judge the opportunity to say here are the here is a
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.460]   laundry list of all the different arguments that you're going to have to provide the math
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.420]   for before you insist on the harm to the industry, the harm to yourself, the harm to
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.420]   consumers.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:06.940]   They're also the also just simply the idea of antitrust is very, very well defined.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.340]   There's a lot of precedent to call upon.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.980]   And so it's going to be if Epic is going to have to come up with something something
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:19.020]   stronger than we know antitrust when we see it and we're looking at it right now, Apple.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.020]   And so.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.940]   And then they get ruled on the injunction, but just based on the way she responded on yesterday,
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.480]   it doesn't look good for Epic, but we still have to wait for that.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.860]   And then they'll set a trial date.
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.580]   So even the injunction is just a temporary decision.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.340]   I thought Epic was so smart at the beginning.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.140]   I thought they were so tactical when they originally sued Apple, but not Google.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.140]   And then they sued Google.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.660]   I'm like, ah, that feels like I missed that because you kind of want more of the Google.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:49.340]   And then they just one thing after another, it feels like it feels like Tim Epic has a
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:54.220]   hissy fit against Tim Apple instead of this being like a real precise, like base camp
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.780]   did a better job of litigating this than Epic did.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.700]   Well, base camp is in the Rebel Alliance.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:08.660]   The coalition for app fairness includes Epic, Spotify, tile, tile, of course, CEO testified
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:13.660]   against Apple in front of Congress saying, we can't, we can't compete with what Apple's
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.660]   doing.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.660]   Base camp is in there.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.060]   They had the Hey.com email app, which by the way, I think,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:25.220]   sank without a trace anyway, despite the huge amount of publicity they got and Apple eventually
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.500]   kind of people who really like it.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.660]   But yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't, yeah, I don't know.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.660]   I don't know.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.660]   I wonder.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.660]   Didn't do anything for me.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.660]   Blix is involved.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.660]   I don't know what Blix is blockchain.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.060]   Desar, another music company.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.620]   The, this is how you know this is not the Rebel Alliance.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.980]   The European Publishers Council match.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.100]   I'm not sure if that's pre match the magazine or match the app.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   I don't know.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.460]   No, it's, it's the Tinder people.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:58.540]   Tinder people news media Europe prepare proton mail and Sky demon.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.380]   Most of these things are interesting to me.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:03.540]   So these are all go ahead, Lori, first, Lori, and then the new.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.100]   These are all companies that are saying that they can't compete because Apple is too big.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.900]   What's their argument?
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.860]   What are they saying is bad about?
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.820]   They say it's any competitive.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.820]   Here's their demands.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.620]   They, they say no developer should be required to use the app store exclusively.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.540]   You should be allowed to sell independently of that.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:29.340]   Every developer should always have access to the app stores.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.300]   Every developer should always have the right to communicate directly with its user through
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   its app.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.940]   Apple also prohibits that.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.980]   By the way, it's not about communicating directly to the user through the app.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:43.620]   It's about getting the user information, which Apple blocks for privacy reasons, right?
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.220]   No app store.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.820]   And this is the problem with all this.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.020]   It's a little mealy mouth.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.740]   It's like, oh, we just want to communicate directly with the user.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.300]   No, everybody understands what you really want is the user information so you can make
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.580]   a mailing list or marketing.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.180]   No app store owner or its platform should engage in self-preferencing its own apps or
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.420]   services.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.100]   That to me is the antitrust issue.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.540]   And the judge, by the way, did not buy into that.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.780]   But is Apple somehow preferring its own apps?
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.460]   In other words, as an example, did they block XCloud Microsoft streaming gaming service because
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   they want you to use Arcade instead?
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.860]   And I think that that is somewhere that you could go with this in antitrust.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.820]   No developer should be required to pay unfair, reasonable or discriminatory fees or revenue
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.820]   shares.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:36.660]   I don't think that stands, holds water because 30% is kind of the standard across the board
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.660]   everywhere.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:38.660]   Right.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.660]   I think it is unfair.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.420]   It's a reasonable amount of money.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.580]   So the big one to me is this notion of is Apple somehow behaving anti-test.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.100]   Well, they also wanted access to all the developers off the minute that Apple has it, which seems
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.100]   just logistically.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.100]   No.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   We got to write the book first.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.100]   What are you talking about?
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.460]   That's a hell, that's a hell mirror you put in the free, you put in those.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.260]   I think to me, it still hired the wrong lawyer.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:06.420]   I think that's interesting to me is that platforms don't have to be based on devices
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.420]   or based on operating systems.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.620]   And we're seeing increasingly what's happening with YouTube and even only fans and a bunch
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.980]   of different social networks that are more creator centric.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.940]   And I would not be shocked if next year we hear that Ninja is suing Epic because he
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.100]   wants his own skin and emote store inside Fortnite.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.100]   That would be why.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.100]   He uses so much revenue.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   They should.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.460]   And also that maybe Drake or maybe Taylor Swift wants their own subscription premium service
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.020]   inside Spotify because Spotify is so big.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.020]   Perfect.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.020]   They're the platform.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.300]   Excellent way to kind of turn the tables on.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   I doubt it.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.300]   Right, right, right.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.300]   That's it.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.220]   You may as well say that I'm going to sue Coca Cola for having.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.540]   No, no, not that it would happen.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.820]   But he's saying it's an example of it's the same thing, right?
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.820]   And so that's a.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.820]   That's a.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.820]   That's absurd.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.740]   No services get bigger and bigger.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.420]   They own more and more of the market.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.420]   And then it becomes unfeasible to launch a product if you're not part of those services.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.740]   And then if you're a really powerful, that's what Epic is doing.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.980]   They're saying we're really powerful.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   Right.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.980]   It's unfeasible.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.980]   We're the Google Play Store.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   We want our own thing.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.500]   And Ninja and Taylor Swift and all these people are going to get so big that they're going
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.780]   to say it's not feasible.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.980]   You own the customer.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.820]   We want to have a direct relationship and we want to have our own billing service on
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.500]   your platform and what about.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:26.660]   What about there's one other potential avenue that I kind of agree with, which is that
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:32.820]   Apple seems to be somewhat inconsistent or unfair in enforcing its app store policies.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:41.000]   And what Epic's pointing out chiefly is the deal that Eddie Q made with Amazon clearly
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.900]   kind of undermining their 30%.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.700]   And maybe again with Luna, we don't know.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.580]   Yeah, with Amazon's new gaming service.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.580]   Is that good?
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.580]   That's going to be on iOS.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.580]   But that's going to be somebody.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.580]   Michael is saying that's a progressive web app.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.580]   Is that not the.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.580]   It's browser based.
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.540]   So that Apple wouldn't have any control of anyway, right?
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.800]   I mean, we've even said if Epic could make Fortnite a browser based game, they would
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   have a problem.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   Yes.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.900]   So the fact I don't know how I, you know, that's I think that takes it out of that.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.020]   Nevertheless, it's pretty clear that any Q made a deal with Amazon because all of a
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:19.940]   sudden Amazon's, you know, back on the store and stuff, not not to take that full 30% cut.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   Am I right?
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   Renee, is that it's a pretty critical.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.820]   And you can't well, they don't they say it's not a new category, but nobody knew about
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.820]   it.
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.580]   There's only two other people in that category.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.580]   Yes.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.580]   Alcaten Amazon.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.580]   Premium video services.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:37.640]   So that's, that's, I think that's also another avenue.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   So I think there's two avenues you could reasonably pursue and maybe Epic made a strategic mistake
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   by not going.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   Just fine if you're a small company.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   It's just not fine.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.520]   If you're Apple, like all that wheeling dealing is exactly what Apple did for a decade and
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.280]   a half when they had no market share.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.200]   It becomes problematic only when you have so much market share.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   Right.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.000]   And there's, I think the bottom line here is that there is a lot of really good arguments
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   to be made.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.640]   There's a lot that Apple should be made to explain.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.140]   It's just too bad that I really think that Epic had the, the early part of their planning
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.540]   was, oh, let's do a parody of the 1984 video.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.580]   And we'll be have one of our Fortnite players be the, the, the woman with the, with the
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.820]   sledgehammer.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:19.100]   And it was, they did something that was flashy as opposed to effective because one of the
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:24.100]   things we haven't discussed is that we touched on it just a little bit is that developers
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.220]   need to have the ability to, to establish a relationship with their own customers.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:33.440]   And that's a mutual, yes, it's possible for them, for a developer to sign up a user for
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.260]   all kinds of marketing stuff.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:40.400]   But the thing is, I don't know any developer who says, I think it's great that I can't talk
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.020]   to my, that I can't talk to my users directly.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.900]   I think it's great that when there's this big, big layer between me and the customer
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.220]   service that I need to be able to perform for these people.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.620]   And that is something that I really think that Apple needs to address.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.380]   Apple also needs to address if I'm giving you 30%.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.300]   And you're promising me a very, very safe place to do business.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.580]   You have to give me that safe place to do business.
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:07.940]   You can't allow knock offs of my app to, to, to ever make it into the app store on and
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.940]   on and on.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:15.380]   It's just a shame that you have one of these flashy, these flashy like TV lawyers prosecuting
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:20.940]   the following this lawsuit, as opposed to, I'm metaphorically speaking, they did hire
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:25.300]   a kind of a dream team of, of antitrust lawyers to do, to prepare this case.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:31.540]   But it feels like they've got this flashy TV lawyer who wants the sound bite, who wants
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.460]   the press conference afterward.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.300]   It's easy to create what they don't want the win.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:40.220]   Basically we're being Tuesday morning quarterbacks because now that the judge has gone, "Wap!"
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.260]   We get easy to say, "Whoops, that might not have been the best strategy."
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.220]   Maybe they didn't know that going in.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.740]   It's only, it's only stupid if it doesn't work.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.740]   If it doesn't work, then that was very stupid or you were very unlucky.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:58.060]   We have the benefit of knowing what the judge is going to say.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.260]   And honestly, isn't that much what the judge is going to say?
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.620]   If it's a jury trial, obviously the judge has a lot of influence on the jury.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:12.020]   But if it's a jury trial, it may be epics and their attorneys just kind of feeling that,
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.300]   "Well, normal people are going to buy this.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.300]   Normal people are going to get it.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.220]   I'm not sure I agree with that."
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.220]   We'll see.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:28.220]   In come August 2021, we can say, "See, that was a bad strategy."
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.700]   If it gets, do you think it'll settle?
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.340]   I think that if Epic wants to continue to make money off of Fortnite, I don't think that
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.860]   they can afford to have this benched for an entire year.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.340]   I think that's right.
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.620]   I bet you that's what the judge is thinking when she said, "I'm really busy.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:51.220]   We're going to hold this off until next July."
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.980]   Is code for, "You better get this solved now."
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.980]   We're going to hurt most of you until you can fix this.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:05.420]   I keep remembering what a lawyer was telling me a few years ago that most non-criminal
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:10.020]   legal proceedings are basically about two lawyers hashing out a deal between each other
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.340]   and then telling the judge what they agreed upon.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:19.860]   That's what the court system in these cases is designed to do.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.460]   You don't want to have to put your hands in the pocket.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.580]   That's why she said, "You can't predict a jury.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.740]   No one wants to do that."
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.420]   I've been in this situation only once.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:37.380]   I never, ever, ever want to go into a lawyer's boardroom with my attorneys and their attorneys
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.100]   and do the negotiation.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:44.380]   It's the worst and it's cutthroat and it's a nightmare.
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.660]   The stick is, or we could go to court.
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.900]   That's always a stick.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.860]   If you win the one that will just appeal, then you will be off for another two or three
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.860]   years.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.020]   Nobody wants that.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.940]   Even Apple and Samsung eventually settle.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:03.740]   For God's sake, Popeye and Pluto settled their differences rather than continue in the
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.740]   current courts.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.740]   Actually, that's a good point.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.940]   There is no urgency on Apple's point of view.
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.940]   I don't care.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:09.940]   It's all of that.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:15.140]   It's all of the money that they're losing every single day.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.460]   Money is more meaningful to Fortnite than Apple.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.460]   Exactly.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.700]   Yeah, from Apple's perspective, that's a really fluid thing.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.060]   Today, it's Fortnite, but yesterday it was Minecraft and tomorrow it'll be the next new
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.060]   thing.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.140]   From Apple's perspective, I don't think they're stressing about how much money they're going
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:36.940]   to lose off of the 30% that Fortnite would make because they can just move on to the
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.780]   next thing.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:44.740]   That's why I've always said, if anybody has standing in this, it's Microsoft and XCloud.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:50.100]   I'm really wondering, because that's the one where Apple might...
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.100]   And Stadia.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.900]   They have a hard time explaining themselves.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.900]   But Microsoft and Google are not going to...
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.340]   It feels like they don't get us though.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.140]   It feels less like Malice to me and more like incompetence.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.580]   I don't mean that in an accusatory tone.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.220]   I don't think Apple understands at a deep level that this is the next Netflix.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.660]   Because they allow Netflix, even though they have iTunes, they didn't bother them.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.940]   They said Netflix was fine.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.300]   They're Spotify, even though there's Apple music.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.020]   I really don't think they care about Apple Arcade enough.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:24.220]   They'd make a ton of revenue sharing for whatever it's called now, Game Pass.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.260]   But they just don't understand that it's a streaming service.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.620]   They think it has to be apps.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.860]   Therefore, it has to be in these little cubicles.
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.340]   They've designed for apps and they're missing the ability to think just one step beyond
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.140]   what they know.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.460]   The biggest issue that Apple's not going to lose any money off of this.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.860]   But they're one weakness.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:47.660]   And this is where TikTok kind of threw the pooch and not figuring out how to best press
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:54.220]   and advantage is that the government, there is a bipartisan push to get every company
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:48:01.140]   that makes, let's say, over a trillion dollars under the heel of tighter legislation.
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.620]   And the only real arrow in the government's quiver against Apple is how it runs the app
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.620]   store.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:12.140]   So it's no surprise that Spotify jumped on board this really, really quickly why a lot
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:16.120]   of people who feel as they've been pushed around by Apple have been jumping on board
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:22.420]   of this because they have grievances that Apple may have too much power over certain
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   markets.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.660]   And they want the government to be very, very aware of that.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:31.580]   So it doesn't even matter who gets selected, who's our president next January.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:39.060]   This is a bipartisan effort in the federal government and every state of state government,
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.340]   individual attorneys general.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:47.820]   If Apple does not need this kind of distraction, Apple does not need this kind of fire to have
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.420]   to operate under if they're going to be in this very, very hostile environment in 2021
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.900]   and 2022.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.580]   And so Epic is kind of throwing this away.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:01.580]   We'll still hear about it, but they could have really, really created a situation where Apple
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.020]   is going to be so sufficiently embarrassed, where Apple could have seen this as a chance
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:13.260]   of, well, we were largely unaware of the grievances of these large companies.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:18.140]   But of course, once they made these grievances known, we were more than happy to adjust our
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.580]   long-standing app store.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:24.180]   So of course, we have no interest in controlling these markets because look how fair we were
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.020]   when they came to us with these grievances and now that opportunity has kind of been
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.020]   lost.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.300]   Let's take a little break.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:36.420]   We have more to talk about, of course, well, not much more, but I got to fill an hour.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.420]   So we'll fill it up.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.500]   One last thing we hope before we'll be able to please.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.420]   So the other thing is I think there, I think there's a part of this that is just happening
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:45.420]   to Apple.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:49.180]   And what I mean by that is apps are going through what every form of media has gone through.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.540]   Like we've gone from CDs to downloads on iTunes to every music you want to listen to
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.740]   for $10.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.020]   We're doing that with magazines now with Newsstand.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.100]   We're doing that with Project X Cloud.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:03.340]   You know, video games used to be 60 bucks, a cartridge, and now they're going to be $10.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.700]   All you can play.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.820]   Everything is going from scarcity to just ubiquity and it's totally destroying the old
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.900]   business models.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.140]   And that's happening to apps too.
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.700]   And there's a tremendous amount of frustration, especially from traditional developers who
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.260]   used to have a valuable scarce product, they could sell for a lot of money.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:23.700]   And now everyone and everyone and their friend are making apps.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:28.020]   And a lot of that frustration goes on to Apple and goes on to Google to some extent.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.860]   And I think it would behoove Apple to just give them updates, give them demos, give them
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   everything.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.740]   I don't think it would change much materially because the market is going to go mainstream.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.940]   There's no stopping that, but it would alleviate a lot of the contention between apples and
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.020]   apple and developers.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.620]   And I don't think it would cost Apple anything except a little bit of complexity along the
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:47.620]   way.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.580]   I lately have been saying this thesis and I don't know how well taken it is.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:57.340]   A few years ago, I got a lot of people mad at me by saying get over it, physical media
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.700]   is dead.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.660]   And I think it's over time I've been proven right.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.660]   But people hated that.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.980]   No, no, I love my Blu-ray or my CD now.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.540]   Physical media is final and people like me and everyone.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.060]   Yeah, you want your comic books.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.300]   But we like freedom, man.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.540]   That's what we like.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:21.740]   But I think there's another step happening here in this exact move away from physical to
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.740]   digital.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:28.220]   There's a step happening and starting first with games where your games are just streaming.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.380]   Your whole library is in the cloud, whether you're doing it in the studio's way where
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.140]   you buy the whole game, but you play it or you're doing it Microsoft's way where you
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.860]   have a subscription.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:42.180]   I mean, honestly, it's really interesting that the main way Microsoft wants you to buy the
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:49.700]   new Xbox is by paying a $35 a month subscription to all of the games.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.260]   And well, I will throw in the Xbox.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.860]   Actually, if you do the math, it's actually something like $40 cheaper than buying the
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:52:00.900]   Xbox outright because I think they see this is the future.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.140]   But it's not just of gaming of gaming right now.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:09.340]   But ultimately, that's why I really think Apple's silicon, as much as I'm excited about
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.220]   it, is a little retro.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.460]   It's the notion that all the power it needs to be on your desktop.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:21.820]   Whereas really, the power is moving to this cloud and the device is kind of irrelevant.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.700]   And I feel like that's kind of where we're right.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.180]   But I think Apple's making a smarter bet because I think some people are going to do
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:32.220]   thin client and I think Apple's going to do edge computing where they combine really powerful
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:36.140]   local devices to handle everything that the cloud will never be great.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.420]   Like I think the cloud is great at doing all of this heavy lifting, but I think you're
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.420]   still going to want high performance, support things like privacy and machine learning and
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.780]   other things locally.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.700]   And if you can have not very expensive, really powerful edge computing, you'll beat out just
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:50.700]   a dumped in client.
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.340]   Well, and somebody told me on this on Twitter thinking, I wish I could give them credit,
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.340]   but I can't remember who it was.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:53:00.220]   But I think this is also an excellent point, which is Apple Silicon is ultimately flexible.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.780]   It isn't a desktop processor.
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:02.900]   It's a mobile processor.
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.060]   It's a tablet processor.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.060]   It's a desktop.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.980]   And Swift was designed to scale across from the silicon all the way up to the operating
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.980]   system.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.620]   So what it really does is puts Apple in this marvelous position where they can make the
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:18.060]   chip be exactly what it needs to be at any given platform.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.060]   And that.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.060]   And core isn't an AirPod Leo.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.140]   And core isn't an AirPod Mac Pro.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.900]   So that may in the long run be the real strategies here.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.820]   They may say, yeah, desktop may be dying.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.900]   It doesn't matter because we're going to have a platform that works everywhere.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:37.100]   And for those people who need the power and 18 GPUs and 100 CPUs, we can do that.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:41.700]   But for those of you who want to thin clients, so you can play, see where Apple's losing
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.980]   out and they really need to get their stuff together.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.700]   They don't have very good cloud services to do that.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   They can't do gaming in the cloud.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.940]   It's really it's Google.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.940]   It's Microsoft.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:52.940]   It's Amazon.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.940]   Those three.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.940]   They can give you the best experience.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.100]   If they if they stop being so blind to that to this future of streaming or maybe I'm misunderstanding
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.420]   them, but if they stopped acting this way to the future of streaming, they could have
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:06.580]   like that traditional thing, but you can get the best experience for Xbox on your iPhone.
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.580]   Right.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.140]   Well, there's only one other company.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.460]   We were talking about this on Sunday, Facebook, who has this.
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.780]   I mean, clearly they have the ability to scale globally.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.620]   They have servers everywhere.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.620]   They could conceivably do it.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:24.900]   But I don't I can Apple could Apple credibly put together a cloud presence to rival Google
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.900]   Microsoft and Amazon and Microsoft like they're doing now.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:36.340]   The bottom line is that Apple has the financial firepower to accomplish absolutely anything
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:40.300]   that they decide is a priority for the company that is not a that is not an immigration.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.500]   I don't think I don't think you can throw money at some problems.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.060]   You could have 700 billion dollars.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.460]   You can't necessarily solve this because because you need talent.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.060]   You need you know, it's very there's some scarce things.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.300]   They could they can hire.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:58.100]   They've had a good good practice on hiring away talent for like they did not have Apple
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.380]   is not a health company, but they hired away some of the top researchers, the top people
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:06.100]   who understand hardware design for this sort of thing.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:12.660]   That doesn't get you there either, Andy, because those people are now alone in a vacuum instead
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.660]   of with their big teams that they were with that were focused on all that.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.180]   So I don't see Apple like taking over health.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.780]   Well, no, not taking over them.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.500]   They don't have to take it over.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:29.780]   If they can have as we can as we have seen, they can take over a segment of the health
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:33.580]   market that is interesting to them or they think they can do something interesting with
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.860]   and they wouldn't even if they wouldn't necessarily have to build out the server hardware that
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:42.420]   they that their competitors need because those competitors again, they they are in the business
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.700]   of selling computing power.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.460]   So they would be more than happy to self right to rent.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.580]   Absolutely stuff to Apple's sponsor.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.460]   I am I realized that this is just an opinion.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.860]   I can't back this is not the sort of thing that can be backed up by by statistics or
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.860]   facts.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.780]   But I do believe that Apple has demonstrated that they they have had a good track record
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:06.060]   of entering a market that they've had no prior visible experience with with absolute juggernauts
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.580]   who seem to have ruled this this entire market and clean.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:16.660]   But don't you think they've thrown every penny they could cloud and still don't have
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.420]   a very credible offer that they don't have they don't have a good idea.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:25.820]   But you don't the Google is not Google cloud services and not Google drive.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.220]   It's it's not Google music.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.780]   It's not even necessarily YouTube.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:34.420]   It really is computational powered really they can it's it's one thing to to take 30%
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.580]   of what apps are selling for.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:42.420]   It's another thing to be the machinery for pretty much every intensive computing task
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.060]   that needs to scale infinitely globally.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.380]   And that's why Amazon is doing so incredibly well.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:53.380]   That's why IBM is doing IBM Microsoft and and Google are doing so incredibly well because
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:58.340]   they it's it's what they're essentially doing is they are taking like a fraction of a penny
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:02.660]   off of every dollar that's transacting on the Internet at this point.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:07.740]   And so I don't think Microsoft wants to be a gaming cloud gaming giant.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:12.340]   It's just hey we got to ask you it's it's it's it's a really it's a demonstration.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:16.820]   Well it's also it's also what it's also what the publishers really really want because
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:23.220]   especially with gaming they've gaming companies publishers feel almost intense pain every
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.020]   time someone buys a secondhand copy of a game.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:30.900]   And even though it's a three year old game that they can't that's kind of a backish back
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.500]   title at this point.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:36.700]   This is a user that that was not going to buy it for 70 for $70 wherever the current
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.780]   list prices.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:41.740]   The idea of having making sure the people are not owning this content that they're playing
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:47.780]   with means that when I get the 70 bucks out of this person I that is that is one sale
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.260]   that I that will never ever corrupt any other sales that keep on going all the way to the
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:57.740]   high dream of I'm going to make this person continue to pay us money every single month.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:02.940]   The idea of like old old people's memories of hey look I bought this super Nintendo cartridge
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.900]   and I saved up and I own this cartridge and hey look I can now play this cartridge with
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.420]   my kids dead and gone.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:14.820]   They're offended that hey look you should not be you should not be you should not be playing
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:18.940]   a super Super Mario World 3D with your kids you should your kids should be able to should
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:23.140]   have to buy another copy of Super Mario World rather than putting this this cartridge back
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.140]   in.
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.220]   So they are serving the needs of their customers their customers are not the game players the
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:32.860]   companies the customers the game publishers that's what Apple's missing out on with gaming.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.620]   Actually evil I see in our chat room passed along an article from May of this year in
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:43.140]   your protocol some of the world's best cloud talent is assembling in an unlikely place.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:47.780]   Apple the quantity and quality of the new hires has caused a stir in the tight knit cloud
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:52.860]   community and could it indicate that Apple is finally getting serious about building tech
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.060]   infrastructure in a par with companies like Amazon Microsoft and Google.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:01.420]   So you're right maybe they are making those acquisitions they hired Michael Crosby who
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:11.780]   is a Docker guru Aaron Gupta from AWS Maxim Pavlenko from AWS and Frances Campoy who is
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.060]   ex-googler will be working on Kubernetes.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.940]   So maybe Apple does have aspirations in that in those quarters.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:22.260]   Or they'll be like the car where they're gonna they're gonna hire a higher way a lot
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.700]   of really great executives who think that they're about to make the next best thing.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.180]   But then three or four years later.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.780]   Yeah, that project that you're working on and never official existed.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.380]   It's gonna be a it's gonna be a watch app.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:35.380]   Sorry.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.180]   Let's take a break.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.540]   I showed we got a great panel.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:42.340]   Lori Gill managing editor of imore.com.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.860]   Did you see Micah's purple wig?
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:44.860]   I thought I did.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:47.100]   We thought it was so good.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.340]   Yes, it's it's Lori with a beard.
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.860]   But now you're not purple anymore.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.500]   So so you can have it.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.700]   You can have that wig.
[00:59:55.700 --> 01:00:02.820]   Andy and I go also here WGBH in Boston and Renee Richie from youtube.com/Renee Richie.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.580]   Do we need a brand for that?
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.580]   Double R.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:06.580]   Double R.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:10.220]   I was gonna say that the podcast and do it Georgia should have been GNR.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.780]   But then I think Axel Rose would sue us.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.020]   You know I like it.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:18.340]   How long have you had the shelf chotch key behind you?
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.380]   Like the custom logo shelf chotch key.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.380]   Oh, he's had that a while.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.140]   Yeah, a couple of months.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.540]   Yeah, it's the same people who made the imore hall of fame awards.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   I just love their work.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   It's really nice.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.900]   How's that new podcast going with with Georgia?
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:32.900]   That's awesome.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.900]   She's so smart.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.900]   It's like I'll say.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.860]   Yeah, I'll say something if she'll be like, well, that's because the human brain works
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.820]   this way and then I'll just shut up for 20 minutes.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:42.180]   That's a nice mix actually.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:48.860]   The superficial tech geek meets the deep thinking psychotherapist.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.860]   It's great.
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.900]   It's an actual.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.900]   You're not a superficial tech geek, believe me.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   I'm just teasing.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   I try.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.220]   Our show today is brought to you by literally quite literally by cash fly.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.980]   That's our CDN, our content delivery network.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.660]   And cash fly has been around since 1999, but we've been using it practically since we
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.340]   started back in the 2000s.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.700]   I would say we've probably been using cash fly for a dozen years, more than maybe.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.340]   When we first started to it in the first couple of years, it was a real challenge to figure
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:27.980]   how to get it to you so you could listen to the shows downloaded from a webpage.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:33.460]   Yeah, that's fine, but HTTP streaming is weak and it wasn't always guaranteed.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.660]   The speeds could vary.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.540]   Our servers were choking.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.620]   So then we went to BitTorrent and we would have to beg people on the show.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.300]   Please seed our content so others can listen.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.740]   That's when Matt Levine of cash fly called me up and said Leo, let us help.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.100]   And I'm so glad.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.420]   So glad they did.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.740]   Now we've been doing this on cash.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:59.380]   I guess we were early beta customers of their storage optimization system.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:04.340]   We've stored our content on the cash fly servers for a very simple reason.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:10.460]   Cash fly, the idea of a CDN is they have servers all over the globe and your content
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.540]   is cached on those local servers.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:17.620]   See those dots so that when somebody say from Perth wants to download the show, they
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.300]   don't have to download it from North America.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:25.300]   They downloaded from cash fly servers near Perth means they get it faster, means less
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   bandwidth is consumed on the global internet.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.860]   It's just good all around.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:33.860]   No buffering, no problems, no headaches.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.860]   So we really like that.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:39.180]   It works really well for us, but there's one little problem getting our show to that server
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.140]   in Perth.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:47.140]   And those are the sad to say the cash misses.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:51.100]   And the first person in Perth tries to download that show.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:56.660]   Cash flies to go out to your origin, let's say Amazon S3 and download it over the public
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.660]   internet.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.540]   That's a delay for your customer.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:04.900]   It also will cost you money because Amazon charges for egress and it can actually severely
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.260]   increase the costs.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:12.060]   So we have been doing this for a while and this is what a cash fly is now offering everybody.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.780]   Storage optimization system.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:19.100]   You store instead of on your origin, you store your content on cash flies servers that keeps
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.060]   your data closer to your customers.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.820]   Without neighbors or competitors traffic reducing your customer's experience, you'll save huge,
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.340]   maybe as much as thousands a month by shielding your origin.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:37.420]   And because there are no longer any cash misses, your download speeds are dramatically improved.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.580]   Not to mention the reduction data transfer out fees.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:46.580]   A hundred percent cash hit ratio means everything just works better.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.620]   And that's one of the real benefits of being on cash fly.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.980]   Another benefit they're rapidly expanding those servers.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.420]   They just added new pops, six new pops in South America.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:01.420]   They're serving 10 times the amount of traffic in Latin America over the last year.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.420]   And so they're responding.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:06.040]   And that's one of the things I love about cash fly is a company that really is always
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.060]   building to make their service better.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:12.700]   They've not only maintained, but dramatically improved their performance in the region while
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.260]   taking on a much higher traffic load.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.140]   So it doesn't matter where your listeners are.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:23.620]   North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, or the Middle East, Asia, Pacific,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.340]   Australia, their goal is to deliver content quickly and reliably even in those hard to
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.820]   reach regions.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.300]   You can expect consistency.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.580]   You can expect performance.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:38.020]   And because of their reliable throughput and scalability, you can expect performance up
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.420]   to five times faster than other CDNs.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:48.340]   And SOS has cash flies 100 percent uptime SLA guarantee and it's industry leading global
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.420]   performance.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:54.380]   So you'll eliminate because you're coming in over the cash fly backbone right to that
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.380]   server you eliminate.
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:05:01.260]   Those cash misses, they're delivered five times faster than from your origins.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.420]   Software goes in faster.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.420]   Games have played faster.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.420]   It's the future.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.860]   Cash flies also are a great corporate partner.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.340]   We really love these guys because they care about their community.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.740]   They've donated over $50,000 to World Central Kitchen.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.180]   They're serving 300,000 warm meals to people struggling during these difficult times.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:21.820]   Another reason to love Matt Levine and the cash fly team.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.420]   100 percent uptime, cash fly is your go to.
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.180]   Want to know how much you could save with cash fly?

[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.460]   can do for you.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.180]   No high pressure, no sales, just information.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.940]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.220]   We feel so fortunate to have them as a partner.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.540]   Bringing you our shows very, very quickly.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.820]   There's another Apple acquisition.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.740]   They just bought Scout FM.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.180]   Have any of you, did any of you use Scout FM?
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.100]   You can't use it now.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.100]   No.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.100]   They shut it down.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.100]   No.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.020]   Scout, actually they didn't just buy it.
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.780]   It was earlier this year.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:13.660]   Scout was a podcast app that put together a stream for you.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.900]   Normally what you would do is you'd figure out what you want to listen to like this show
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.660]   and then you'd subscribe to it and then it'd be on your device.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.500]   Scout, you'd just say, "I'm interested in technology and this and that."
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.540]   It was more like radio, right?
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.380]   Custom curated content.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:30.580]   It was kind of like a radio program.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:38.420]   We didn't know about this acquisition till now, Apple, insider revealing it.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420]   What do you think?
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.660]   Does this mean Apple will do?
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.660]   Here's my speculation.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.060]   They've got new Beats channels.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:50.260]   What if they did a Beats podcast channel?
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.700]   Like instead of talk radio?
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   Do they?
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:59.300]   What are Apple's podcast ambitions?
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.020]   I'm asking for a friend.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.740]   I'm asking for a friend, Lori.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:07.380]   They were kind of the progenitor of a app catcher, right?
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:14.300]   They don't need to have ambitions because they kind of started the whole thing in terms
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:20.940]   of having one place where you can download and listen to or stream podcasts.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.540]   They're there.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.180]   So yeah, I think I like this idea of what you're talking about live podcasting.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:32.620]   Is that kind of what you're talking about where there's a DJ that then introduces you?
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:41.300]   No, I think it's more generated by an engine because it watches what you listen to.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:46.020]   It's the TikTok of podcasting or the YouTube of podcasting.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.980]   That doesn't mean that's how Apple's going to use it.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.700]   Isn't that already what's happening with podcasts?
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.420]   No, it's using an algorithm to recommend other podcasts.
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.420]   Yeah, but you still would have to subscribe.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.260]   The idea is you would tune to Lori's channel.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.260]   I guess I never used it.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.260]   It's gone now.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.260]   They turned it off immediately.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:10.100]   You would go to Lori's channel and based on the initial seating that you did with stuff
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.580]   you liked, not necessarily shows, just topics.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:18.020]   And then what you could listen to or what you would skip, they would provide.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.620]   Because I guess they're trying to, Scout was trying to solve the problem.
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.620]   It's like Beats.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:22.620]   Yeah, like Beats.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.220]   Like what it was when it first started.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.220]   That's why I thought about it.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.220]   That's how you started it.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.220]   Okay.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:32.420]   And I thought that this was to solve a problem that I don't have.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.180]   I know what I want to listen to.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:37.900]   But I think most people, especially if they're new to podcasts, don't.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.140]   And they know they want something like this.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:44.260]   And so it's a recommendation engine that doesn't just show you and say, "Subscribe to this."
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.260]   It plays them.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.820]   And you start listening.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.620]   This thing that happened like Glass WWDC, they started doing recommendations for episodes.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.100]   So like the biggest problem with podcasts previously is unlike YouTube, they couldn't
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.620]   recommend individual episodes.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:04.220]   So for example, if I watched the TWIT WWDC special in YouTube, I would see Marques Brownlee's
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.900]   and mine and a bunch of other similar content that I might also want to watch.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:13.060]   But in Apple podcasts and almost every podcast client, I think with the exception of Breaker
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.700]   at this point, was I would just see other shows.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:21.340]   Like there was no way to listen to the Mac Break Weekly episode on WWDC, the TWIT episode,
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.620]   the talk show episode, and the discovery wasn't there.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.220]   And they started making a discovery engine previously.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:33.140]   And I think their hope here is to decompile podcasts into episodic content that they can
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:38.220]   then use ML to assemble into a playlist and get people listening longer.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.380]   And they'll face the same problems YouTube and Facebook have had in that they will very,
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:46.420]   very quickly start to extremize people, like red pill people, if they're not very, very
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   careful.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.940]   Like with conspiracy podcasts, after conspiracy podcasts.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:56.220]   The goal I think is to make podcasting in general more discoverable so people find more content,
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.220]   more episodes they like.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:02.660]   That I'm all for, but the last thing I want is another, yet another algorithmic recommendation.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:08.580]   I am so tired of being recommended things.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.900]   I want to be the one that chooses what to watch.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:18.060]   And the internet is closed off to me because every service is recommending what it thinks
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.500]   I want to watch.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:25.100]   And I want to be, I want to open, I want, I want that, but I also want to just open the
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.740]   door and see what's inside.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:32.020]   And there's like no way to get to that without signing out of your account and then just going,
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.380]   okay, what's on the internet today?
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:38.980]   So I don't want to be recommended things anymore, you know?
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.660]   How would you find them though?
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.260]   I'm just digging around.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.100]   I bet though that you want your friends to say things.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.900]   Like if I said, oh, have you seen raised with wolves yet, that would be okay, right?
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]   Yes, definitely.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900]   Yes.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900]   That's what we want.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900]   But we don't like these engines.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.500]   Why haven't they done that?
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.900]   They've had years.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.700]   Why haven't they done?
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.700]   What?
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.620]   Have Tim Cook call me up and say, hey, Leo, I'm friends with, I'm friends with, I'm
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:07.100]   Apple music or whatever.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.100]   Friends.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.100]   Well, they did do that.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.100]   They didn't do that.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.100]   They did garbage.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.180]   They didn't do like Lori and Leo and Andy listened to this one show that you've never listened
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.180]   to.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.140]   Therefore, we're going to show you that your friends are listening to this, you know, like
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.580]   high probability matches based on my friends and not.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.180]   It's still mechanical, right, Lori?
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.300]   It's still not as appealing as if you're just sitting around.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.460]   Yeah, because that's, that's the thing too is like, Leo, you might watch, you know, a
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:35.420]   bunch of daytime talk shows and I'm never going to be interested.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.740]   You know enough not to listen on that regard.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.300]   And, and this is the missing piece.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.140]   I know you.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.420]   So I'm not going to tell you about daytime talk shows.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.420]   I may like them.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.460]   Like for instance, I'm embarrassed that I like that yacht show.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.980]   But I would never tell you to watch that.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.260]   But I do know you like kind of dark sci-fi.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:03.500]   So I might say you should watch raised with wolves because I, so it's a two way recommendation.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.420]   It's something I like, but I also, it's like setting you up with a done a date.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.780]   It's also, this is somebody, this is something you would like.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.540]   We should use the matrix plug people into the machines and let the people machine nodes
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.740]   pick the content for us.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:18.980]   There's no, no machine is going to replace a human being.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:25.260]   I would love to have just an on off button for recommendations where you can just, you
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:31.740]   know, you open up Netflix and you are, you know, you've looked through all of the recommendations
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.820]   and all the things that they've put into the, they've, you know, aggregated into the different
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.020]   categories based on what they think that, you know, what the thing thinks that you're
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.020]   going to like.
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.620]   And then you go, you know what today?
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:47.700]   I'm going to just explore and then you turn that off and then all you're getting is literally
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.500]   just the stuff that exists.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.980]   You can filter it by most popular.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.620]   You can filter it by alphabetical.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:00.020]   You can filter it by the date, like what year it came out and then you are the one exploring.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.620]   The Criterion Channel does not have a recommendation aspect to it at all.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:10.380]   So if you're in the Criterion Channel app, they just put up the movies and then you're
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.500]   in charge of deciding what you want to watch.
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.660]   And I love it because there's dozens and dozens of movies.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:19.460]   I never thought I'd even be interested in, but I just click on it.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.620]   Oh, look, there's a little blurb about this.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.980]   It's a noir movie.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.620]   I don't watch noir movies usually, but here I go.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.060]   Now I'm watching this noir movie.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.940]   And now I'm really interested in noir because I watch this one movie.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.620]   That doesn't happen anymore because it's all being given back to us.
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:39.860]   I get to the point where my streaming services, I know everything that's being recommended
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:44.700]   to me and it just keeps re-recommending it to me because I keep re-watching the movies
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.100]   that are recommended to me.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.220]   So it narrows it into the point where there's nothing.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.660]   There's no discovery left at all.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.500]   And they change the poster right now to trick us into watching it a second time.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.780]   Look, if you go to Netflix, you go to iTunes.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.540]   Oh, no, it's not you.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:13:59.980]   You just change the poster.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.620]   I'll go for that.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:06.740]   Well, that's what happens because Lisa keeps saying, let's watch that.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.980]   I said, we watched that last week.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.740]   Now, let's get every week.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:11.900]   Yeah, they do it on purpose.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.380]   Yeah, no, I understand.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:17.060]   It's magic because they're A/B testing to see which one gets the most clicks.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.580]   But all it results in is you think and you've gotten used up when you don't.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.580]   It's horrible.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:21.580]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:28.140]   My problem is more with music apps as far as recommendations go where I think Apple
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   does this.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   I think Google does this.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.700]   I think Spotify is the best at not doing this in terms of big streaming services.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:42.340]   But the difficulty of finding the thing that I don't care that this is pumpkin spice jazz
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.940]   for based on your location.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.100]   I don't care.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.500]   And here's Melo, Mel, Hello, I don't care.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:56.940]   I want to hear the live David Bowie album that I read about online and added to my playlist
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.420]   because I wanted to listen to it.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:02.380]   But the other thing, and this is something that happened to be thinking about a lot over
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:08.180]   the weekend is that one of the failures of the user interfaces or the basic concepts
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:16.220]   of these content services is that it's even email clients, its whole modus operandi is
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:21.380]   to deny us the feeling that we finished something.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:26.260]   It's all optimized towards let's give us an infinite playlist and let's not give the
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:32.220]   user one album and then everything stops after that album stops after that album ends.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.140]   But the brain chemical that says, hey, wow, that was a really good album.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:40.340]   Now I'm going to turn to the next thing I wanted to do in my life.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:44.380]   I was even thinking about this with email where I think that one of the nicest features
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:50.700]   I would love to add to my email client is that at least to have one user, one alternative
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:56.980]   like a mode or user interface where it only ever shows me the most recent 20 emails where
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:02.380]   when I tap into email, I get 20 emails, I can say, oh, well, okay, I have finished this
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   thing known as reading and dealing with 20 emails.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.420]   And now I can move on to the next thing in my life.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:14.340]   The reason why email becomes such a quagmire is because I get hundreds and hundreds of
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:19.300]   emails and it seems as though I've been with it.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.260]   Hey, man, I hear it's wonderful.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.700]   Hey, you're from FaceCan.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:27.460]   Are you using that?
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.660]   I tried it.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.660]   It's not for me.
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.700]   And I'm not saying it's not great.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.420]   For a lot of people, it's a good thing.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.260]   And honestly, it kind of sounds like it might be right up your alley, but that's not how
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.260]   I do email.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.500]   So it didn't work for me.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:47.460]   But I do think there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a happy, happy completed task chemical
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:52.660]   in our brain that lets us take pride in having finished a job, whether it's, hey,
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:57.020]   look, we actually caught, killed and cooked and ate dinner.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:02.500]   That goes back for tens of thousands of years that Reddit will always just let you have you
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:06.180]   scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and then, oh, wow, it's, it's now
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:09.780]   three in the morning and I've been doing nothing but scrolling through Reddit.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.020]   And I think that doesn't work.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.020]   Yeah.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.340]   Well, I just, I just think that that's something that needs to be paid attention to.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.820]   And Laurie, you're, you're right that there's so many, I think that so many services are
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:29.460]   based on adding to our distraction and keeping us engaged to the deficit of keeping us happy
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:32.740]   with the choices that make serving us the choices that we've made.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:38.580]   That is one of the reasons why my, I do all my music, all my media on a local server because
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:43.140]   it will never, ever, ever based on the fact that I listened to this David Bowie album that
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.340]   I bought last week, try to like slide and how about some Freddie Mercury.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.340]   I have begged.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.340]   I have begged.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:55.060]   I have begged repeatedly culture code to make an app called thing where I can only ever put
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:18:00.300]   in one thing and I cannot add to my things unless I have completed that thing.
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.300]   And thus far, they seem way more interested in the plural things.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.460]   It's just, that's how those customers work.
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.820]   They want to keep people watching for as long as possible because that makes them the most
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.220]   revenue possible.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.780]   We have conflicting, the business model conflicts with our internal humanity.
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:20.020]   And it really does what we need to remind ourselves that the, this is no accident that
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:26.180]   really that we, we cluck our tongues at the makers of gambling games, gambling hardware
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:30.380]   that it always makes sure that gives us like sort of a minor win so that we'll keep on
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.380]   playing.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.140]   That has to give us lights at a certain point to make sure that we're just being distracted
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.140]   from the passage of time.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:40.540]   And it's always not horrible that the, that these casinos are trying to take money from
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:45.300]   people who from, from people don't know their how much they're being manipulated.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.300]   Where do you read that?
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:47.300]   Oh, I'm read it.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:51.900]   Four hours last night reading all about stuff like this.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:52.900]   I love Reddit by the way.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.740]   I'm just saying that it's a part of it is like having to make sure that I maintain a
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:02.180]   sense of time when I'm reading about stuff that is also research of news and stuff that
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.180]   I wouldn't have come across.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.180]   Yeah, that's my excuse.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.180]   But also it's easy to.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.180]   That's what I'm doing.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:11.540]   I'm researching when I'm up at three in the morning doom scrolling through Reddit.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.780]   I'm looking for a story.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:13.780]   And you know what?
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:14.860]   I'm sure this is the case for you too.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.260]   I find enough stories that it's completely justified.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:24.140]   I did find a video of a group of capy bars eating a pumpkin.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.140]   There you go.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.180]   Very glad that I thought I'm not joking.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:31.540]   It just made me in a very, it's been a very bad week for a lot of people who like, you
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:36.500]   know, freedom and justice and like, oh, you know, I don't think I will, I don't think
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.820]   I will like watch the video of John Oliver telling us that we're all doomed for 20 minutes.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.980]   I think I'm going to watch how happy these capy bars are to patiently wait for this.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.980]   There you go.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.220]   I'll try to find the one apparently they do this a lot.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.900]   This is not even the one you were talking about.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.940]   And they were patiently waiting for this like immense pumpkin to be rolled out by the
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:59.500]   staff and then they're sort of lined up around waiting their turns.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.180]   Is it is it this one?
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.780]   I think it's the same zoo.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:10.220]   And the watermelon, the watermelon one is good too.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.420]   Now we've gone down the capy bar a hole.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:18.500]   I'm making a scroll into all kinds of different territory instead of like getting to the pics
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.500]   of the week and stuff.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.940]   I'm as just as guilty as anybody else.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.740]   I'm going to I hope you don't mind when I'm going to jump ahead to the actual apparently
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:30.860]   the half of this video is them getting ready for the ceremonial consumption.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.420]   They're so cute.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.860]   They look like big mice.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.580]   Oh, now that you say that, I don't like them anymore.
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.420]   Oh, no, they're so cute.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.420]   I feel cute.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.100]   What do you think they'd be cuddly or is that you could choose?
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.900]   No, I don't think they'd be cuddly at all, but they are cute.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:45.900]   Look at those faces.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:46.900]   They are rooms.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.900]   They are like kangaroo faces.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:54.300]   Lucy Bellwood is drawing a comic of copy bars as like a seafarers in the in the 1800s.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:59.300]   And it's like, Hi, I only have a two and a half thousand dollars in my checking account
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:03.700]   right now, but I can probably cash in some long term stuff and give you more money to
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:08.300]   finish this because the funniest thing is it seems like this is a regular event in Japan.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:14.980]   So, if you had a book of capy bars in your zoo and you knew how adorable they were eating
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:15.980]   like fix fix.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.820]   How do we miss this when we were in Japan?
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:23.060]   The ceremonial feeding of the watermelon to capy bars.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:28.340]   And I have the video ends too soon.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:33.780]   I want it to end with like it like breaks apart to a couple pieces and like and they
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.820]   know and they eat all the watermelon and one of them minds are walking away with like the
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:45.260]   watermelon like a helmet or maybe just a capy bar is leaning back and it's hunch is
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:48.500]   patting its tummy and satisfaction.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500]   Mmm.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:51.500]   That was good.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:52.500]   Mmm.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.500]   Okay.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.500]   Well, you're right.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:22:00.900]   It did end too soon, but fortunately, thanks to the fabulous recommendation engine on YouTube.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.700]   Now we can watch a hippo eating watermelon also in Japan.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.900]   Is it a house hippo?
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.580]   It's a hippo's are also pretty cool.
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.740]   Yeah, they are.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:16.380]   They seem pretty primitive until they want to finish a snicker spar.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:20.700]   I'm talking to now is this how the African Leo they are not see when I watch the first
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700]   time.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.740]   Jurassic Park was a completely bad movie only because you don't fear the carnivores.
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.740]   You fear the big herbivores.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.540]   Nothing kills more people than the hippos.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:34.140]   Anyone who lives in the southern hemisphere will tell you that crocodiles lions, but the
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:37.580]   hippos destroy more humans than the venomous snakes and everything.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.660]   I fear those hippos.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.620]   You're actually exactly right.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.620]   Yes.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.900]   Hippos are more deadly than sharks.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:49.020]   We were not allowed near the water unless we had armed accompaniment when I was a.
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.900]   And it's not that they'll eat you.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.620]   It's just they might roll on you.
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.620]   They're grumpy.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.620]   They'll charge.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.580]   They'll just kill those jaws.
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   Look at that.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.580]   Hungry, hungry hippos.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:03.980]   People die every year in hippo attacks.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:10.780]   It says in this post from CBS.com, even the alligators are afraid of them.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.340]   Forget the velociraptors.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.340]   It was those brachios or whatever that those people should have been running for their
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.500]   lives.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:22.740]   And unlike many animals who are afraid of humans, hippos particularly don't like the
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:23.740]   humans.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.740]   They go after them.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:25.740]   They're tanks and they're salty.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.500]   20 miles an hour.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.380]   And a five ton hippo running at you 20 miles an hour.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:32.380]   Now dodge.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:39.460]   For the benefit of like listeners in the coming week, I will say capybara eat huge pumpkin
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.860]   ASMR posted by the Nagasaki bio park.
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:44.460]   Oh my god.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.540]   That's the that's the one that I've actually like downloaded with downy because sometimes
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.780]   you just need your it's a bad day, but you got your phone with you.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.180]   It's like, I want to hear.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:58.500]   I want to keep both here and watch capybara is like skeleton eyes of a pumpkin in 10
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.700]   year, in 10 minutes.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.140]   Here's what here's an ASMR.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:06.100]   I'll turn on the sound for this one of a capybara eating sand.
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:09.020]   Oh, that can't be good for them.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.940]   Oh, I mean, capybara is.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:15.660]   This is apparently a tame capybara because he's wearing a leash.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:18.020]   So maybe they do make good.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:27.940]   I'm just going to let this run underneath the next ad.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:34.740]   So, it's making me hungry.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:35.740]   We took the sand out.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:42.300]   Wouldn't be crunchy then would it?
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:49.100]   This is from crazy Cody's creatures.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.660]   That sounds good.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.700]   Our show day is front.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:56.060]   We'll have more news next week, everybody.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.620]   Yeah, there's not a lot to talk about.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.540]   I think next week there'll be more.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.940]   I'm very enjoying our time.
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:04.020]   I actually I bought my I bought my mom.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.500]   I said, mom, would you like an apple watch?
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.740]   She said, yes.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:11.100]   Who knew because of the fall protection we were talking about this for seniors.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.740]   Yeah, so I got one for her.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.140]   Did you get her the SC?
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.900]   No, I thought, you know, I'm going to get her the full thing.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:17.900]   She went for it.
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:18.900]   She took a good time.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:19.900]   And all that stuff.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:21.900]   They're not.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:25.260]   I mean, it's not much more to get the it's like 60, 70 bucks more to get the full one.
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.060]   But you're a good son, Leo.
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:31.220]   Well, I'm going to give you an even better son because then I said, wait a minute.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.180]   Can your phone go to iOS 14?
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:36.300]   She said, no, I said, what do you have on iPhone 6?
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.300]   She said, yeah.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.260]   I said, are you attached to the headphone jack?
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.260]   She said, no.
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.260]   So now.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.260]   We're not going to be.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.660]   Yeah, because you're going to lose it.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:50.500]   So now I'm thinking I'm going to send her an iPhone 12 to go along with that new watch.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.740]   I mean, she loves her iPhone and this I we don't know yet, but the rumor is the screen
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.980]   on the Max is going to be pretty big, right?
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:00.180]   I think she loves her iPad.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.180]   Yeah, seven.
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.180]   6.7.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:03.180]   6.7.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:04.180]   Nice.
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:05.180]   Nice.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:07.180]   So I'm thinking.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.900]   Yeah, mom should.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:15.340]   You know, she didn't want another iPhone family set up would have made it possible for you
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.180]   to get her that Apple watch.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.780]   But she has an I know I agree with you.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:20.780]   I think that's really great.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.940]   But then I have to send the watch to me set it up and send her.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.100]   Actually, I probably should have done that.
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.900]   But she's going to be FaceTiming you anyway.
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.140]   Oh, we're going to.
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.620]   In fact, I'm convinced the whole reason she accepts this stuff is because it gives her
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.660]   excuse to spend a lot of time on the phone with me.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.700]   Okay, mom now.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.940]   And it's stressful as you might imagine.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:41.940]   It's a little stressful for me.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.940]   Do you like?
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.940]   Are we happy?
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.740]   She teaches you how to how to.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:46.740]   How to become.
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.740]   So I think it's a good background.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:54.740]   Yeah, that and the capybara chewing sand in the background have really settled.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.940]   I can't be the copy bar.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.300]   Oh, no, now it's just a dog and a copy bar playing with one another.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:06.100]   Apparently YouTube has considerable number of capybara videos.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:07.100]   They're cute.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.420]   They look considerable number of everything Leo.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.420]   That's right.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.220]   This is why I can't really complain that much about the recommendation engine at least of
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:20.140]   YouTube because sometimes it'll surface something like, oh, I was really sad until I saw that
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:21.140]   beautiful animal.
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:22.140]   You cheered me up.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:26.380]   Until I saw that that that that that that beaver eating that eating the that head of
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.380]   head of celery.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.780]   Yeah, so crunchy into little hands.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.300]   You cheered me up.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.020]   Do we like the series six?
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.660]   Oh, yeah, I've been having a lot of.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.900]   It's nice and bright, right?
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.260]   What I'm really enjoying is sleep tracking.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:46.020]   And that's something that I never even interested in.
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:51.700]   But the the battery is so good that I'm not worried about running out of battery health
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.380]   at the end of the day or through the night.
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.500]   And I've been tracking my sleep.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.020]   I found out I wake up a lot more often than I thought I did.
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.020]   It's not a concern.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.540]   I know I do too.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.540]   Yeah, that's what I.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.020]   But it's so interesting to just watch that.
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:06.260]   What is shaming me?
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.500]   Are you using the is there an apple sleep tracker or are you using a third party sleep
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.500]   tracker?
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.980]   I'm using the apple sleep tracker just the sleep in in the health app and it shows me
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:21.060]   I'm unclear on this because it says it just says it'll set an alarm schedule your in bedtime
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.060]   reminders.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:25.820]   But you think that's the bedtime feature.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:31.940]   So then in the health app when you open the health app, you can add sleep as one of your
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.260]   health tracking features.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:39.340]   And if you are if you have your apple watch connected as the thing to track you while
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:44.100]   you sleep, if you if you have to actually enable your apple watch to be the thing that
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.420]   tracks your sleep, otherwise all it does is give you the information of when you set
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:50.460]   your phone down and whether or not you pick up your phone in the middle of the night.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:55.220]   So you want to make sure that it's it's tracking from your apple watch is that's the device.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:29:00.100]   So I see here it says set up sleep your devices can help you get a better sleep.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.260]   I wish that were true.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:06.700]   In fact, my devices do the exact opposite and understand your sleep patterns sleep schedule,
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:11.620]   sleep mode, wind down, apple watch next set of sleep.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.220]   You would have little sleep.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:17.260]   You're getting my phone if you would, judge set a sleep goal.
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:21.500]   Eight hours is probably all I can hope for.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.340]   And then let's see here next.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.860]   Say, Oh, this is this is why I didn't do this.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.900]   I got to set a bedtime and wake up time.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.900]   All right.
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.860]   I'm going to go to bed at 10, but I'm not going to wake up at six.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   That's nuts.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.260]   How about can I wake up at 8 30?
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.260]   Okay.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   Let's add that.
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   Okay.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.260]   That's definitely more than eight hours.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.260]   That's 10 and a half hours.
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.260]   Okay.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.780]   You can have a different schedule for every day of the week.
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.500]   It says why there's no difference in any day.
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.500]   Okay.
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.700]   Sleep mode can simplify your lock screen.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.700]   No tracks.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.100]   Oh, here's the part you were talking about.
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.100]   Okay.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.100]   This is where you want.
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.100]   Enable sweet dreams.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:05.500]   Let me just let me just warn you that if you are wearing your Apple watch and you're
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:13.380]   letting the bed the sleep mode or bedtime mode set the alarm for you on your watch,
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:18.460]   make sure that you have it'll it'll tap you silently.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:23.500]   If your watch audio is turned off the first time I did that I almost slept through my
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.500]   alarm.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.500]   I'm not even kidding you.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.900]   I had my when I finally woke up it was five minutes after my alarm had gone off and I
[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:32.380]   dreamed I'm not kidding you.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:37.100]   I dreamed that I was borrowing someone else's watch and their alarm was going off and I
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.580]   couldn't shut their alarm off.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.300]   Oh, you must have been so tired.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.300]   Five minutes.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.300]   Don't let them get into your head, Lori.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.340]   That's what they want.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.540]   It's hysterical.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:54.300]   And I love what I love just tracking like when it'll just kind of notices when you've
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.700]   rolled over and you know, like you've kind of woken up a little bit.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:00.180]   It lets you know you've been asleep for two minutes.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:01.580]   You were asleep for four hours.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.180]   You were asleep for five minutes and it's all that kind of like tossing and turning that
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.180]   you do all night.
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.660]   It'll just like lay that out for you.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.660]   It's not good to notice.
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.220]   And I don't have anything to use it for.
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:16.220]   But if I needed to talk to the doctor about why I was sleepy all the time, I'd have that
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.820]   information just already there from the last six, eight, twelve months for how I would
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.820]   do it.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:24.420]   Like last night I just I fell asleep last night.
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.580]   I woke up in my watch when oh congratulations.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.260]   You slept eight hours for the first time.
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.340]   I was like shut up.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.340]   Oh, geez.
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:34.940]   It's like the early days of the turn by turn was like redirect.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.500]   Oh, you missed the turn redirecting.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.380]   Oh, like it's so disappointed.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:39.380]   Oh, sorry.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.980]   You're suggesting that the Apple watches Minnesota nice.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.220]   Oh, good for you.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.420]   You did 30 minutes of activity.
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.180]   Or as it was a nice word.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:53.180]   Bless your heart.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:59.660]   I thought it was like though, for me is astonishing.
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:02.460]   Like I put it on at seven o'clock and I had to repeat it.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   I couldn't believe it.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.020]   I put it on at six or seven a.m.
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:08.620]   I used to sleep tracking through the night and it worked until midnight the next day.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:12.620]   Like I was getting 36 hours repeatedly over the out of the series six.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:16.220]   I wasn't that was only for like the middle of the testing I talked about last week, but
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:17.620]   it's it's still like that.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:18.820]   And I don't I don't think it's going to last.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:19.820]   I'm not going to count on it.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.260]   I'm not going to get used to it.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.460]   That's its plan.
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.460]   I really appreciate it.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.460]   I have it.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:29.060]   I can tell you from from my perspective, I've I've I've fully loaded the Apple watch it.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:32.140]   I just transferred from my five to the six.
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:36.420]   So it's got all of the apps that I use all of the time and I work out for about 45 minutes
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:37.900]   five days a week.
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.900]   So I get almost exactly.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.740]   Well, I guess 24 wouldn't be the right way to put it.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.140]   So I put my Apple watch on at seven o'clock in the morning.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.340]   I wear it all day.
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.620]   I sleep all the way through the night with it on.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.620]   I wake up in the morning and it's down to somewhere between 10 and 15%.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.180]   It's usually about 13%.
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:33:01.260]   I throw it on my charger while I drink my coffee, read the news and then that's between six
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:08.020]   and seven and then by seven o'clock in the morning, it's at 94 somewhere between 92 and
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:10.220]   even as much as 100%.
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.900]   That's every single day.
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:15.060]   And then I go and work out and I you know, the percentage drops for a few minutes.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.100]   So I'll throw it on my charger just while I shower.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.940]   It's not really even necessary to do that though.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.420]   But if I wanted to make sure that I was totally fully charged, I can get that extra couple
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.060]   of percent that I lose from the workers.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.220]   You're saying if you just charge it every day while you shower, that's enough to keep
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.300]   it fully charged all the time.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:37.100]   If you charge it for an hour, you will be almost 100% charged.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:41.940]   I think it's like, I would guess it's like about 90% charge in an hour.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.740]   So if I'm at 10%, it's at 100%.
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:47.940]   All right, I'm going to have to wear this to bed tonight.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.340]   I don't like wearing jewelry in bed.
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:55.460]   You got to get yourself a braided loop because it's so comfortable.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.860]   Yes, that was the trick for me is that I put on the braided loop.
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:04.060]   It's like putting a ribbon around your wrist like you barely feel it.
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:05.060]   Okay.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:07.220]   Is the weaving staying intact for you?
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:11.500]   I've seen some people post pictures of, hey, wow, 100 bucks and now look, this thing has
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.100]   pulled apart a little bit.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.100]   Is it early?
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:20.220]   It could maybe somebody who has wider hand girth might stretch it out a little more.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.540]   Maybe that's why they're seeing the looseness, but I haven't seen that happen at all.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:29.300]   I've had it on for three weeks, two weeks now that I've had it.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:30.500]   No stretching whatsoever.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500]   But Joharn and...
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.500]   I'm sorry, I'm fraying.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.500]   You were talking about fraying.
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:35.500]   Oh, fraying.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:36.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:37.500]   No, definitely.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:41.140]   I'm not necessarily fraying, but imagine we're one of the...
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:46.380]   Like imagine when you pull on one of the knots in a sweater and just a little loop of it just
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.380]   pulls out.
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.380]   Like a snag out.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.380]   Exactly.
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:51.180]   So that would be like if they accidentally...
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.060]   I bet that would happen.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:54.060]   It's yarn.
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:56.140]   So that is gonna happen.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.300]   That's not an unusual thing.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.620]   So yeah, if I snag it on something, I could imagine that that would happen.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:03.460]   It's made out of the kind of material that would cause that for sure.
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:04.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.780]   A truck driver called me on the radio show.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:11.060]   He said, "You know, I often have to stick my arm in between the two trucks to separate
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.540]   them and it just as hell on watches, I keep breaking their glasses.
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:18.380]   Is there anything I could wear that wouldn't break?"
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.780]   I said, "Wow, you sapphires."
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.260]   "Oh, no, I got sapphires."
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:22.820]   I said, "Well, I have to do this."
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.580]   I think you're out of luck.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:26.580]   I don't think you can...
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:30.580]   I stick my hand in there and sometimes it pitches the watch there and...
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.460]   Oh, yay, yay.
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.220]   Maybe you shouldn't put your hand in there.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.220]   I have a recommendation.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:36.220]   Oh, I have to.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:44.220]   For if you have that come up again, there are watch bandmakers that make rugged cases.
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:48.420]   I'm going to recommend Catalysts because they're my favorite but they're not the only one.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:54.180]   But there's casemakers that make rugged cases that are bandmakers that also have a protective
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.420]   cover for the glass.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.180]   So that would be what I would tell them.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.900]   Excellent tip.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.900]   Thank you.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:05.020]   "Our show today brought to you by our good friends, the people who pay for this whole
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:12.260]   facility, last pass, last pass is what we use at Twit to protect ourselves.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:20.340]   You know, employees at home no longer under the careful eye of our IT department.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:23.060]   And there's all sorts of things people could do.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:26.020]   You know, they're on their own networks.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:29.300]   You don't want employees, for instance, and they do, they share passwords but you don't
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:34.820]   want to share the passwords by texting somebody or sending in a clear text in an email.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.860]   That's the log into my QuickBooks account.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.060]   You're just going to send it in a text message.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.460]   You know, that's why we use LastPass.
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.940]   LastPass lets employees share passwords, keeping access to corporate data safe with their secure
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.940]   pay.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.620]   Everything LastPass does is secure.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.220]   Starting with the password vault.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:58.500]   LastPass gives every employee their own vault for storing every app and web login they use.
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.300]   They sign on with auto fill.
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:01.780]   So it's actually more convenient.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:06.580]   It's really nice to have a security tool that makes life better.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.740]   And that's what LastPass does.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.180]   It makes it easy and safe for employees.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.540]   There's single sign-on employees.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.540]   Love that.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.380]   You just say yes on your phone.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:17.860]   There's enterprise password management tools for you.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:23.100]   For instance, the IT department has complete information on who's accessing what resources
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:24.780]   from where.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:30.460]   To make you much more secure, LastPass surveyed 700 IT and security professionals across a
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:34.580]   big range of industries from financial services to IT to retail.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.580]   Almost all of them.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:41.020]   82% said their business had been exposed to a risk due to poor identity and access management.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.020]   That's what LastPass does.
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.740]   But they do it right.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.980]   So you can eliminate that risk.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:51.340]   Things like multi-factor authentication, adding to the fingerprint or the face recognition,
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:58.300]   adding contextual factors like IP address or geolocation.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:01.660]   LastPass makes it easy and more secure.
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:07.100]   And you can trust LastPass because they use AES-256 bit encryption to make sure your
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:08.820]   vault is safe.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:15.060]   Never decrypted anywhere except on device iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux.
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.020]   They also protect your master password.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:21.620]   It's never transmitted anywhere off your devices, not even the LastPass.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:23.380]   They have no access to it.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:30.060]   And should somebody get your vault, it's secured with PBKDF2, which means it's almost impossible
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.860]   to brute force it.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:36.660]   SHA256, Soled hashes, they do all the stuff you've heard about.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:39.100]   All the best practices in security.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.100]   That's why I use LastPass.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.100]   We're going to have a big LastPass event.
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:48.620]   It's coming at October 8th, a week from Thursday, one o'clock Pacific.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.620]   We're going to have an attack and defense panel.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:57.300]   We've got a couple of security pros on the, maybe even hackers because it's Father Robert
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:01.140]   Ballisare and Brian Chi on the attack side.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.500]   They're going to come up with some attacks.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.460]   By the way, Brian's a great enterprise guy.
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.220]   So he'll know exactly what to do.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:12.220]   And you know, Robert is, you know, Mr. Blackhand.
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:16.580]   And then on the defense side, we're going to have Gerald Bookelt, who's been on several
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:17.820]   of our LastPass panels.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:20.460]   He's the CISO for their parent company, LogMe.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.420]   And so his job is really dealing with corporate security.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.740]   He'll be joined by the legend, the security legend, Bruce Schnire.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:28.180]   So they're going to be the defense team.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:32.020]   So we're going to, we're going to get Robert and Brian to come up with an attack.
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:34.060]   And then Bruce and Jerry are going to come up with a defense.
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:38.220]   This should be a lot of fun and a great educational experience.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.940]   You'll learn exactly how hackers work and exactly what you can do to defend.
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:43.940]   That's October.
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:44.940]   I can't wait to that.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.580]   That's October 8th, 1 p.m. Pacific.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.060]   October is a national security month.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:53.460]   So what better time to talk about attack and defense?
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.460]   LastPass.
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.460]   Thank you, LastPass.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.660]   Number one, password manager in the world for good reason.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:03.180]   Let LastPass securely manage your users' identity by letting your employees work efficiently
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.340]   without making your business vulnerable to cyber threats.
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:09.140]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.380]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:14.300]   We now return to the Capy Barrett channel.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.300]   No.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300]   No.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.300]   No, we won't.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.300]   Later, later, later.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.300]   That's the reward.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:21.300]   Later, later, later.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:35.140]   Apple, according to a 9 to 5 Mac, iPhone 12 production is at full tent, full tilt, 24
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:39.260]   hour operation, mandatory overtime.
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.940]   No time off at Foxconn.
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:46.100]   Actually, this comes from the South China Morning Post.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.700]   Employee Wang Guo Feng said overtime work had increased since summer.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:53.700]   Most workers are allowed only to take four days off a month.
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.420]   You can earn $880 a month.
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:59.580]   If you work at the factory for more than 90 days, there's a handsome amount of special
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.080]   pay.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:04.860]   Another employee, surname Moss, said the company had started night shifts.
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:07.580]   Online's running 24 hours a day.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:14.980]   We have been kept so busy for the past weeks because of the iPhone 12.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:19.700]   I guess that's exactly what we'd expect this time of year.
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:21.820]   It is encouraging.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:29.020]   Rumors seem to have converged on the idea of four iPhone 12 models.
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.500]   Count them.
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:34.940]   And iPhone 12 mini 5.4 inches.
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:36.780]   I've been waiting all week.
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.940]   I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.500]   Because you like the AC.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500]   You like small phones.
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:43.500]   I want it.
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.500]   5.4 inches doesn't sound that small.
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.820]   I mean, iPhone 4 was smaller than the current SE.
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.820]   Is it?
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:52.540]   It's thin.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:58.540]   It's thin the way the original iPhone 4 was, but taller.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:04.540]   So it's like skinny and long, but not as tall as the SE or the current SE.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:09.220]   So it's kind of hitting that sweet spot for me because it's going to be, if all of these
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:13.700]   rumors are true, it's going to have the almost edge to edge screen.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.020]   We'll call it edge to edge screen.
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:21.540]   So the screen itself will be larger, but the case that it's in will be smaller.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.060]   And that's pretty exciting for me.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:30.660]   Here are the hands of Marquez Brownlee simulating the size of the presumptive mini.
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:32.260]   But those are ultimate frisbee hands.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:33.260]   We have no idea.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:34.260]   We have really no idea.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.260]   I think that is.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:46.020]   There will be an iPhone 12, no adjective and adjective free iPhone 12 with a 6.1 inch
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:47.380]   OLED display.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:51.740]   And then there'll be actually there'll be two 12 models with the OLED display, the iPhone
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:54.060]   12 and the F O 12 12 pro.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:43:01.980]   And then the one I think I'll get my mom the 6.7 inch iPhone 12 pro max.
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:02.980]   So four different sizes.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:04.220]   Will they announce them all at the same time?
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:06.500]   Will they be available all at the same time?
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.500]   No.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.500]   Yes and no.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:09.500]   Yes.
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.500]   To the first one.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:11.500]   No, to the second.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:12.500]   Okay.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.500]   So which will be delayed?
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.860]   So there's a couple of different reports.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:20.300]   The ones that I choose not to believe is that Apple will put out the two 6.1 inch ones
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:24.540]   at the same time just because the 6.1 inch assembly line so to speak is all good to
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.540]   go and then you sizes are more problematic.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.540]   Right.
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:31.580]   But the one that sounds more recent and more believable is that the iPhone 12 will come
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.740]   out first almost immediately like usual and then there'll be a slight delay before the
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.500]   iPhone 12 pro models.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.860]   The pro and the pro max hit, you know, like the label.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:43.220]   Will the mini be available right away or sounds like it?
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.420]   Does the mini replace SE?
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.660]   No, it's a higher price product.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.660]   It's like an entry level.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:49.660]   Okay.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:54.660]   So it's not meant to be the low cost one.
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:56.860]   It's meant to be the small sized one.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:01.660]   It would be amazing if it were that size but also had pretty much the same camera array
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.300]   as the iPhone 12.
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:09.700]   If there were no compromises, they basically just took all they did was said, well, it's
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.860]   inevitable that we kind of have to cut down the battery size.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.180]   But other than that, we're giving you a top tier iPhone 12.
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:18.420]   Again, we should emphasize that this is no one knows.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.500]   This is Leak's speculation.
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:24.420]   There were two good and bad rumors though today about well yesterday about it, one that it's
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:26.620]   going to have the same base storage, everything the same.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:31.420]   But then there was this real sketchy rumor and it's a real pet peeve of mine that publications
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:35.740]   are publishing like this person on Twitter with no track record said.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:39.980]   But they were saying that there might the processor might be lower powered because they
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:43.140]   didn't explain why, but they said there's a rumor the processor might be lower powered
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:47.300]   and that would only make sense if the battery couldn't take spikes from a regular size.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:51.940]   I gave 14 because it's such a small process battery, but I choose not to believe this
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:53.700]   until Apple tells me so.
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:59.380]   Well, also, if it's a small phone with a small battery, you don't want to have short battery
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:00.380]   life, right?
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.380]   Brown out.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:02.380]   You don't want brown out either.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:03.380]   We have a bigger concern.
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:12.380]   So nine to five is saying that in fact, the two base models iPhone 12 only have two cameras.
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.780]   And then there'll be two iPhones with the triple lens that we're used to.
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:18.140]   So it may not be the same as the 11.
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:19.340]   The 11 has two cameras.
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.340]   Right.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:22.260]   So the pros would be the one that have the triple camera.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.260]   That's right.
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.260]   That's what makes them.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.700]   Time of flight on the back of it like there is on the I-pro.
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.700]   There will be on the pros.
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:31.700]   Okay.
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:39.500]   The thing is the price for me was that just for size, the iPhone 12 mini might not have
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:44.980]   a face ID, but will instead have the touch ID on the button that I think it would make
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:47.380]   sense to it's small.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:52.740]   And like that camera array would take up pretty much the entire, you know, front of
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:53.740]   it, right.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:59.100]   So like to mitigate that the front facing camera would not be a face ID camera, but
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.860]   it would have a button touch ID instead.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:02.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:08.300]   There's also the problem of how do you if you are putting two cameras on the back of
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:13.820]   it on a really small phone, how do you set them up so that people aren't necessarily
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:16.100]   blocking them with their fingers, but accidentally.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:17.100]   Is that enough?
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:18.100]   I did that now.
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:22.220]   Are we to expect these all to be 5G phones?
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:23.220]   Yes, right?
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.940]   Yes, except different kinds.
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:31.220]   So like the regular iPhones will be our radio frequency range one, which is the low and
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:35.420]   mid bands, everything up to sub six, seven, eight, nine sort of thing.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:42.500]   And the pros will be frequency range two, which includes millimeter wave 4G.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:47.740]   I was originally not that excited about any of them because the delivery of millimeter
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:48.940]   wave is atrocious still.
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:53.260]   Like if you sneeze, your connection is gone and there's just very little of it anywhere
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.260]   this.
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:58.580]   So you have to live on the block and be outside on top of the antenna, but Sprint just announced
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:03.420]   N 41, which is a great frequency range mid range that does up to think one gigabit per
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:06.020]   second and has very far, very good coverage.
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:07.020]   Nice.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:11.700]   So I'm really excited about the frequency range one, which all the iPhones are going
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.700]   to have.
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   And I still think millimeter wave is a waste of power and price at this point.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:21.220]   Yeah, I think it's really intended for business and some special stadiums, maybe.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.220]   So you're in Montreal.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:28.100]   Are you you don't have Sprint, but will your carriers?
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:34.700]   So we have low band 5G, which is mostly which is like LTE plus 20% on a good day, but it
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:36.020]   should have better coverage.
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:40.500]   Like it should Daniel Bader says this so well, it should deliver on the promise of LTE for
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:44.580]   people in suburban and rural areas who are just always underserved.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:49.540]   But our better and our better frequencies have been postponed because of COVID.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:51.860]   The auction was postponed till next year.
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.620]   So who knows how long it's going to take to get any of that now.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:01.220]   9 to 5 says the modems will be Qualcomm still while Apple continues to work on their own
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:02.220]   silicon.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.220]   Yep.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.220]   That makes sense.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.980]   This will be in a 14 like in the new iPad, right?
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.460]   Yep.
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:09.460]   But not.
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:10.460]   It's like B14.
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:11.460]   No, it's bionic.
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:16.300]   That's why the rumor that there'll be a B14 in the mini, which but that's not landish
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.620]   rumor still, but the 14 is still bionic.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:20.100]   It's the same architecture.
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:24.620]   It's slight improvement in performance, a really good improvement in efficiency.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:25.620]   They're using five nanomie.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.300]   I did a 24 minute long video Leo.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.300]   So please cut me off.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:30.300]   If I get no, this is good.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:31.420]   No, we got the details on this.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:35.420]   But it's it's down to five nanometers, which is a 1.8 times transistor gain.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.300]   Apple's not using all of that as far as we can tell.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.940]   So they are shrinking the package as well, which is going to make it much more efficient.
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:45.380]   And they're spending their transistor budget smartly there.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:48.340]   They are increasing the CPU and they're increasing the GPUs.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.340]   They're better performance.
[01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:50.660]   The GPUs are new architecture.
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:53.500]   They've got a 16 core neural engine now.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:57.020]   The original one, I think was two cores and then they went to eight cores.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:00.580]   Now it's 16 cores, much better machine learning accelerators.
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:06.140]   And they're using all this IP for better blocks to do dedicated tasks on the chip.
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:09.780]   So you should once again just because it's one of the problems and I'll just digress
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:13.740]   for a second is that a lot of companies are hitting Moore's law hard and you're seeing
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:20.140]   Nvidia spend enormous amounts of voltage to increase power, which is just not good overall.
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:24.460]   And Intel is just spending cores, which is similarly you hit thermal limits.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:28.940]   And Apple is by virtue of using efficiency to increase performance.
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:33.140]   They're getting modest gains overall, but they're doing such specialized packages that
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:37.420]   I think they're going to we're going to be surprised by how well they work inside the
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:40.860]   phone for the tasks that we do with iOS.
[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:45.940]   Other rumors speaking of smaller packages, Apple will save money on shipping costs by
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:48.540]   eliminating the earbuds and the charging brick.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.420]   They did that with the watch.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:54.060]   I noticed.
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:50:02.020]   And they'll make up for that with a braided cable.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:03.500]   Lightning to USB C.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:07.020]   For the pros though, right?
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.340]   That one's not for all four of them.
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:11.740]   That's just for the pros, I believe.
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:18.700]   Yes, the pros will get the braided cable, but even the non pro will get the USB C to
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:21.580]   lightning cable.
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:22.660]   That's just who knows?
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:28.540]   You know, these rumors, these as you say, I could even just be one cable that Apple is
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:30.380]   going to sell.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:34.260]   That doesn't necessarily mean it's a cable that will be in the box.
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.300]   And most people still have USB A on their PCs.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:39.380]   So I mean, who are we serving from these changes?
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:40.380]   Right.
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:44.500]   The thing that I found kind of interesting is that, again, according to rumors that for
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:51.020]   the bottom two, it's still going to be 64 gig as the floor for storage, which seems kind
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:53.700]   of chancy in 2020.
[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:59.220]   I know that a lot of people say that 64 gigs is plenty, but that's not a whole lot of head
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:00.220]   room.
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.220]   If you're shooting 4K video, it's not a whole lot of headroom.
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:06.060]   If you're downloading movies and video that you bought or streamed.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:12.660]   Well, presumably that would be scaled to size so that the mini would be the one that started
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:18.580]   at 64 gigs, which I don't think anybody's shooting 4K video on a phone like that, that
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:22.820]   they would most likely be buying the pro phone if they're looking to do something like that.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:28.020]   So it might be a matter of keeping a cost for the mini to, because I'm not going to
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:30.220]   pay $1,000 for a mini.
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:31.220]   That's too much.
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.780]   But if you give it to me a few hundred dollars less than that and you kind of like kind of
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:42.500]   trim off some excess that could help reduce the cost, like I would get a 64 gig mini
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:48.580]   instead of a starting price of 120 gig mini because that would give me the lower starting
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:49.580]   point.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:50.580]   I saw it.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:56.020]   I did see one of the Twitter rumors that both the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 mini, again,
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.500]   just a rumor.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:58.860]   The floor was 64.
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:51:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.380]   This is really interesting.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:06.900]   According to Apple track, 72.7% accurate John Prosser.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:10.940]   His score went down a little bit.
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:16.340]   The first shipments of iPhone 12 going out to the studios October 5th, there will be a
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:19.420]   mini with 64 gigs.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:22.620]   There will be a 12 with 64 gigs.
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:26.780]   The pros will have will start at 128 gigs.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:27.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:28.780]   Apple's facing.
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:29.780]   Go ahead.
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:30.780]   This is what happens.
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:37.300]   Well, look at the issue that have Wi-Fi signals meet.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:43.220]   The issue Apple's facing is that the cost for these phones have gone way up because they're
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:45.700]   putting OLED panels in the regular models now.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:51.220]   They're putting much better OLED panels in the pros and the 5G modems Qualcomm is exacting
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:54.180]   a really pretty penny for all of that technology.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:56.460]   We've seen other vendors hike up prices.
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:02.380]   If you look what Galaxy S20 and Note 20 costs this year compared to last year, even some
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:06.980]   of the higher end OnePlus devices compared to previously, everyone is just passing those
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.300]   costs on to consumers.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.660]   It looks like Apple wants to maintain pricing.
[01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:13.900]   They're going to play a little bit of a game where they reduce the mini by 50 bucks but
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:16.900]   raise the regular one by 50 bucks.
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:21.420]   You have basically two ends of those, but they're going to keep the $9.99 and $10.99
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.820]   and not raise those.
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:27.580]   Everything that they can do to cut costs around that and keep those prices, I think they're,
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:31.060]   I don't want to say desperately, but I think in 2020 when people are really feeling the
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:35.580]   pinch, they're trying to keep those prices as stable as they can.
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:39.100]   I just wonder if they're robbing Peter to pay Paul.
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:45.140]   If they're making, I hope that some total of choices that they're making, meaning that
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:47.940]   we're not, we're going to hold the line on display technology.
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:50.300]   We're going to hold the line on processor power.
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.060]   We're going to hold the line on this, this, this, which means that we have less money
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:59.420]   left if we're going to hold on to a 650, $6.99 dollar price point to put in 128 gigs.
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:05.540]   I hope that they're not taking away something that would be useful and life-saving.
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:09.780]   If you are on a vacation and you didn't know you're going to be spent, you're going to
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:10.980]   be shooting 20 minutes a video.
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:14.460]   You didn't know you're going to be hanging out and doing a lot of stuff and suddenly
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:18.420]   you are just playing out and you've got more, you've got too much time before you can get
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:20.300]   back to the hotel and the Wi-Fi.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:25.900]   That's something that people would say, gee, I'm really glad that I have this high refresh
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:30.620]   rate on this display so that the warning saying that you're totally out of storage, sorry,
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.820]   you're not going to be able to get pictures.
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:33.380]   Oh, you're not even getting that.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.740]   But at least you have an SD card.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:36.740]   Oops, sorry.
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:37.740]   Right.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:39.620]   That's all we have the headphone.
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:41.580]   Oh, oh, don't.
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.980]   Not even the headphones, Andy.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:47.900]   Like you have nothing to plug into that jack anymore.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:53.300]   How about if there's like a USB, if there's a USB-C type jack, but it's just a sticker?
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.300]   So I have this nightmare.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:55:00.380]   I have this nightmare that Apple's finally going to announce USB-C for iPhones.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.860]   The minute the consortium announces USB-C mini.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.460]   That's how I see this all the way.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:08.460]   Hey, yeah, I can just see that happening.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:09.460]   Huh.
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:14.980]   We decided to put a notch in our USB-C jack just to be Apple.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:20.100]   I feel bad if I were John Prosser because he's been downgraded to 72.7% accurate.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.620]   He's back up though.
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:25.380]   And then Fudge, somebody named Fudge is beating him.
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.380]   90% accurate.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.220]   There's so much drama, Leo.
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.220]   There's so much drama.
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:31.860]   Notice that Fudge only has 11 roots.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:33.860]   Yeah, these would be accurate.
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:34.860]   When you only have 300.
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:40.460]   Yeah, accuracy only matters with how many, like in comparison to how many rumors are out,
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:46.220]   which I think Renee had brought up once before that you kind of, that's, that tips the scales
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:51.260]   for sure that, you know, I could be 100% accurate if there was one thing that I said
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:52.500]   that happened to come true.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:55.060]   So, you know, it kind of, you gotta take it.
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.660]   There is an U-ray boss champion though.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:00.340]   There's Kang who's like, he says, he only says things immediately before they happen,
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:01.340]   but they're always 100% true.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.580]   So, I imagine that he's just watching the things fall off the assembly line into the
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:09.460]   truck and then putting him up on sign away bow and then like, just like it just 100%
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.460]   accurate.
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:13.620]   Love to dreams pretty, pretty accurate.
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:15.780]   He had pictures or she left though.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:18.980]   Oh, he left really pictures of the watch band.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:20.220]   None never released man.
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:22.980]   If you can get this, you have something special.
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:27.780]   This is the Tokyo Olympics 2020 commemorative watch band.
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:30.380]   Of course, the Olympics didn't happen.
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:31.820]   It looks just as a red watch.
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:35.260]   It's a, it's a sport loop.
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:37.060]   Red and gray.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:38.060]   It's pretty.
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.060]   I would get that.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.100]   Yeah, I did that a couple of years ago when they actually had a winter Olympics.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.100]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.420]   I asked my mom what band she wanted.
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:45.420]   I said, I'll get you the red watch with the red bench.
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:48.180]   I said, no, I want black on black.
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.180]   I said, cool.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:52.220]   Your mom has mapped black all the things.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.260]   Yeah, cool.
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:57.260]   Okay.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:00.860]   Let's see, I think we can, is there anything I missed that's really exciting?
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:02.940]   There's 14.01 came out.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:06.900]   Lots of bug fixes, still a few bugs in a, at least on the iPhone.
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:10.740]   Little weird things, but they fixed them up.
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:15.860]   They fixed them up no longer signing 13.7.
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:16.860]   That's it.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:17.860]   You can't downgrade.
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:18.860]   Sorry, kids.
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:19.860]   Sorry, kids.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:24.980]   I has watch OS 7 been reliable and good for you guys.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:27.380]   That seems to be no problem for me.
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:31.100]   A lot of people had battery issues, but I think repairing solved it for most of them.
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:32.460]   It happens, it seems, every year.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:33.820]   Yeah, that's normal.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:35.700]   I did, by the way, Lori, turn on.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.380]   I didn't have hand washing, turn on.
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:39.220]   Now annoys me every time I wash my hands.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:42.100]   So that's a good, that's a good, that's a good, good.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.740]   It goes off from, did we talk with us?
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:44.900]   It goes off from me when I'm making it.
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:48.740]   Like if I'm cooking and I'm sizzling onions and using the pepper grinder, the combination
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:52.060]   of the sound from the sizzling onions and the movement from the pepper grinder sets it
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.060]   off every time.
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.500]   I'm like, I got up grind pepper for 20 seconds.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.500]   Now thank you.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.340]   Well, now we have some, we have some new information.
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:05.620]   They could do like a fried food alert sensor saying, are you having something fried again?
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:12.300]   Oh, hey, here's a, here's a question for you.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:16.500]   I'm doing, you know, I do this show called Hands on Mac, comes out every Friday.
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.860]   It's just me and my Mac and some tips and stuff like that.
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:25.020]   And I've been doing, I just started a series called the Road to Big Sur, which is, which
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:27.180]   is all about, you know, getting ready for Big Sur.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:30.340]   Cause as I mentioned, I think I'm going to wipe the drive and start over.
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:33.180]   So I've been talking about things to do.
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:37.780]   And I'm about to do two more, which won't come out for a couple of weeks.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:38.780]   Should I not?
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:42.220]   In other words, will Big Sur be out by then?
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:50.740]   I have spoken several books about major Mac OS releases and I've learned to basically
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:52.540]   slide too much past the deadline.
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:55.980]   If you have any chance of being accurate or all.
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:59.060]   Are they going to wait till they have Apple Silicon and then announce it?
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:02.900]   That would be like no, like like October, like that would be a while.
[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:03.900]   I don't think they will.
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.900]   I don't think they'll wait for Apple Silicon.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.500]   There's no reason for them to do that.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:11.620]   I think they'll launch it at the iPhone of us.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:12.620]   Maybe.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:15.820]   Maybe next week, maybe this week.
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:18.020]   Oh, so it might be soon.
[01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:21.420]   Yeah, I don't think, I don't think it's this week though.
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:25.740]   I have a feeling it's going to be a little bit later than that, but it could be within
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:29.100]   the next couple of weeks.
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:31.940]   People who are using the beta, I don't know who that is.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:34.780]   Is it, is there, is it pretty reliable now?
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:38.020]   Or I'd heard there was kind of had needs some work.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:41.540]   Yeah, a lot of people said, please hold hold hold.
[01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:42.540]   Don't rush it.
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:45.140]   Don't rush it.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:47.140]   Okay.
[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:51.340]   Just what just asking as I said, ask your friend.
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:53.780]   This is this is an exciting time.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:57.740]   I've never been so clueless about we were used to like predicting, Oh, well, there's
[01:59:57.740 --> 01:59:58.740]   good.
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:00.140]   So that's going to be an October event.
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:03.580]   And we're going to definitely see the launch of the old master of this by them.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:05.380]   And nothing you can count on.
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:08.180]   Like, okay, Cesarospora.
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:12.060]   Well, there's they have two bites of the apple this time, not to not like not to be
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:15.020]   punny, but they can release the Intel version.
[02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:19.860]   And then when they do the apple silicon, they can talk about all these specific features
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:23.780]   for apple silicon, like the hypervisor stuff and a bunch of other little and the secure
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:27.380]   the new secure boot facilities and they were new, the remote restore stuff.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:29.380]   There's a bunch of stories they can tell around that as well.
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:33.660]   So we'll be getting like two versions of big sir, almost like when they did the second
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:35.620]   version of tiger for Intel Max.
[02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:38.940]   It's not typical that they would talk about big sir at an iPhone event.
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.820]   They usually reserve that for the iPhone.
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:41.820]   Yeah.
[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:43.780]   So I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.020]   Especially something as important as the iPhone, where I'm not sure if they want to distract
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:48.020]   a test.
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:51.220]   I'm not sure if they have distracted attention like that before.
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:54.420]   Usually the iPhone launches have been pretty focused.
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:55.420]   Yeah.
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:56.860]   They could give you 24 hours.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:57.860]   Notice the Leo.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:00:58.860]   I mean, true.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:00.860]   Right.
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:01.860]   Plenty of time.
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:04.260]   Let's take a little break and we'll come back.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.940]   Prepare your picks of the week.
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:09.860]   Our show today brought to you by Twilio.
[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:10.700]   Developers love Twilio.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:12.460]   I love Twilio.
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:19.460]   Anybody who wants to engage with their customers, wherever their customers are, would love Twilio.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:25.260]   In business now, the most important thing is to stay in touch with customers, to help
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:29.020]   them, to engage with them, to give them what they need.
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:35.340]   And you can, with Twilio, engage with customers anywhere they are, text messages, emails,
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:40.100]   phone calls, video, all on one single powerful platform.
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.380]   It's time to build with Twilio.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.780]   Twilio operates at scale.
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:53.340]   They power 795 plus billion interactions across channels with 5 nines of uptime, 99.999% uptime,
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:58.980]   3 billion phone numbers available, more than 100 countries.
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:02.380]   Shopify uses Twilio to run their entire global contact center.
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:04.780]   That's that Twilio Flex product.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.780]   One million customers.
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:06.780]   That's huge.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:11.340]   Blue Apron uses Twilio SendGrid to do their newsletter emails.
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:16.220]   Netflix uses Twilio 2-Factor to keep your online accounts secure.
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:21.020]   In fact, it is probably most of us use Twilio in our everyday, in our lives.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:23.900]   If you use the Authy app, that 2-Factor app, that's a Twilio app.
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:27.020]   My favorite 2-Factor authenticator.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.780]   Mind sharing and contact lists, delivery services.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:35.620]   Lyft and Uber use text messaging from Twilio and on and on.
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:36.860]   Everybody uses Twilio.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:41.220]   Productions and operations teams love Twilio for creating new ways to communicate with
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.620]   their users inside of applications.
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:45.820]   In fact, it's so easy to work with Twilio.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:49.380]   If you're a web developer, you already know how.
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:53.460]   If you build web applications, you can build apps that text, call, chat, and video conferencing
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:55.900]   with just a few lines of code.
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:59.420]   This because Twilio is built by developers, for developers.
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:04.580]   You don't need to be some sort of specialized telecom network wizard to build incredible
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.740]   communications apps.
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:08.780]   You just need Twilio.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:12.940]   Marketing teams love Twilio to get the word out, connecting with leads over text message,
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:17.940]   you can phone calls, they send campaigns over email, they build chatbots with Twilio
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:19.340]   to answer questions.
[02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:23.420]   I'm guessing probably more than a few political campaigns are using Twilio to send out all
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:27.420]   those texts we've been getting in the last couple of weeks.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:29.780]   You can do it all with Twilio.
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:35.100]   And of course, that Twilio Flex App, very popular with customer service teams, helps
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:40.380]   you build a global contact and support center as easily as possible.
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:45.580]   Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire businesses,
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:47.940]   something you want, something they want.
[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:49.460]   It's easy to do with Twilio.
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:52.660]   Go to Twilio.com to learn more today.
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:53.660]   www.lil.com.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.660]   I'm a Twilio customer.
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:57.660]   Just as a hobbyist.
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:03:59.060]   I love playing with Twilio.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:00.940]   I use it for all sorts of things.
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:06.140]   Twilio, it's time to build.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:08.220]   Thank you, Twilio, for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:11.380]   Andy Anaco, do you have a pick for us?
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:14.660]   I have a pick and actually another, that's kind of a tip.
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:20.660]   Last week, I recommended very, very highly, Joyce D'Anato's streaming recital at the
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:23.460]   Mentor Opera site, $20.
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.860]   You got to stream it for about a week.
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:27.460]   It was supposed to go away on Friday.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:32.620]   And I recommended it last week because it really was kind of beautiful and spiritual
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:34.940]   and again, really, really tough week.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:38.980]   And it really helped me find my sense of peace and perspective once again.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:44.380]   I'm very, very pleased that a bunch of people, listeners tweeted an email saying, "Hey,
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.540]   I think it's from the recommendation."
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:47.820]   It really worked out well.
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:52.260]   It was supposed to go away on Friday because Ann Underprett and Trevko is going to be doing
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:53.780]   a concert of her own.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.380]   Unfortunately, she contracted COVID.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:56.380]   So that's been canceled.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:05:00.940]   See, another performance that was supposed to be in two weeks time has been canceled because
[02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:03.900]   the location has become a COVID hotspot.
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:07.700]   So the only good news to come out of that is that they are keeping up, Joyce D'Anato's
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:09.660]   recital for the entire month.
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:11.860]   So if you miss it, I missed it.
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:12.860]   Oh, good.
[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:13.860]   Exactly.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:18.860]   So I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:20.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:22.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:24.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:25.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:27.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:28.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:29.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:30.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:31.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.

[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:14.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:21.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:28.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:35.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:42.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:49.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:56.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:09:03.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:10.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.

[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:31.860]   I'm not sure if you're going to miss it.
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:38.860]   I've ever seen on the Internet one cookie.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:39.860]   That's it.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:42.860]   No trackers, no Facebook, no analytics.
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:46.860]   Ling looks out for her customers.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:51.860]   That's because she's Ling and you're not.
[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:54.860]   I think it's because there's so much animation and color on that page.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:59.860]   There's no more bandwidth left and out cloudflare or anywhere to do more tracking.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:02.860]   There's no tracking on this, the ugliest page on the Internet.
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:07.860]   Is there another site where we can check for conflicts between medications, prescriptions
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:10.860]   that this person might be taking?
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:11.860]   We interviewed her.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:15.860]   Years ago, I interviewed her on a triangulation.
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:17.860]   She was wearing a life jacket for some reason.
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.860]   I'm not sure why.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:22.860]   Quite a character.
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:23.860]   You know what?
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:24.860]   You got a lover.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:25.860]   No trackers.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:28.860]   Good for you.
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:31.860]   That's the markup.org/blacklight.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:35.860]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:39.860]   I was actually going to mention this before we saw the Swite spoiler on your screen, but
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:44.860]   there's a new video from ILM up which talks about how they did model work.
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:49.860]   How did you two know this was your pick of the week and then recommended to me before
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:50.860]   you mentioned it?
[02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:52.860]   It's crazy, man.
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:53.860]   Crazy.
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:58.660]   No, I mean, you know everything Leo, but it's just so delightful because you see everybody
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:00.660]   doing all the old school Lucas people.
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:01.660]   People have been there forever.
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:02.660]   Just get so excited.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:04.660]   They get to do model work again.
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:05.660]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:09.660]   And when they hear someone's printing something, they go and they all crowd around and they're
[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:14.660]   watching it and then they have to get a shot ready and they can't get the track they want
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:15.660]   in times.
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:18.660]   They got to borrow one of the old traditional ones and they have like an old school can
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:24.660]   and camera filming it and it's just it is so delightful on so many geeky nerdy levels that
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:27.660]   it's not my pick of the week, but I did want to bring it up just so that everybody.
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:29.660]   It's pretty cool to watch it.
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:30.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:35.660]   The Mandalorian is some of the best art wars we've had in like in many decades.
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:37.660]   This and rebels and Clone Wars.
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:39.660]   So I'm super happy that it's getting all those things.
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:42.660]   So is this Mandalorian effects primarily or?
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:43.660]   Yeah, this is all Mandalorian.
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:47.660]   This is how they designed the ship and the influences and how they built it and how they
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:51.660]   they filmed it using like real models and it's just it's so good.
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:53.660]   Oh man, this is amazing.
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:58.660]   Yeah, that was our first 1080p camera that Alex Lindsey bought the old model camera.
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:01.660]   Yeah, from episode four.
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:02.660]   So good.
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.660]   Yeah, really cool.
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:06.660]   But that's not your real pick.
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:11.660]   No, my pick of the week is that again, we're spending a lot of time on home screens now,
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:16.660]   you know, with things like Widget Smith and this one is another app and did I paste it?
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:21.660]   Yeah, sticky widgets and it basically it's either as brilliant or as horrific as you decide
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:26.660]   that it is basically it lets you put widgets that look like sticky notes like marker felt
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:34.660]   encrusted pastel colored sticky notes on your iPhone to store lists or reminders or notes.
[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:38.660]   Almost or I guess, you know, if your if your IT department makes you change your password every
[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:39.660]   two weeks, you could stick.
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:40.660]   Don't stick that there.
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.660]   Please don't put your password there.
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:47.660]   But it just lets you turn that your iPhone screen into a sticky note so that you can
[02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:49.660]   remember all the things you want to remember.
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:53.660]   So I'm going to joke with the developer that he should offer comic sauce as a as a $10
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:54.660]   in app purchase.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:55.660]   People would buy it.
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:13:00.660]   I think I think they would for both the best and absolute worst reasons.
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:05.660]   But I'm and I'm sure he's going to develop it, but it's proven really popular right away
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:09.660]   and somewhere Johnny I have an Allen dies eyes are just bleeding as they're watching what's
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:11.660]   happening to all these home screens.
[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:14.660]   But you know, people want functionality.
[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:15.660]   Yeah.
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:16.660]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:19.660]   So if your Apple wants it to look better, you know, their job is to make it look better,
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:22.660]   but people are really enjoying the sort of experiences they're getting.
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:25.660]   And this is another way that you can make widgets more functional for you.
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:31.660]   And if you want to rebel against the lack of home screen widgets on the iPad, OS, you
[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:34.660]   can just fill the left column with sticky notes.
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:35.660]   Yeah.
[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:37.660]   And then send a copy to Tim Cook.
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:38.660]   Make it the wall.
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:42.660]   Make a wallpaper with sticky notes on it and just keep adding that and that could be your
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:43.660]   defiance.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.660]   Great pick of the week.
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:46.660]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:49.660]   And now Lori, I'm getting my wallet out.
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:50.660]   Yes.
[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:52.660]   What's your favorite week of the week?
[02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:58.260]   Well, it depends on if you're a retro camera fan because what I'm recommending today is
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.260]   the Polaroid camera.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:01.260]   Yes.
[02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:04.660]   The Polaroid that makes takes instant pictures.
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:09.660]   They just recently came out with a Mandalorian theme.
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:10.660]   What?
[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:11.660]   I type, which is their standard.
[02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:18.540]   So today's standard Polaroid camera, film camera, is called an eye type and that's what you're
[02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:20.100]   familiar with.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:26.740]   And they have a special edition model right now that has a little Mandalorian logo on
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:28.660]   the top back side of it.
[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:33.780]   And you can also get, I just got the film because I own my own Polaroid.
[02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:34.740]   I have for a couple of years.
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:35.740]   I absolutely love it.
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:36.740]   How big are those prints?
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:39.980]   They're just the size of the old Polaroid prints.
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:40.980]   Yeah, they are.
[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:43.420]   Yeah, they're the same size.
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:48.100]   I have a box of them that I'll show you right now.
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:52.580]   This looks like my mom and dad when I was a kid had an SX-70, which is the top of the
[02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:56.700]   line Polaroid, or meet the Swinger, Polaroid Swinger.
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:15:00.940]   But so this is not a bad camera for 120 bucks.
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.940]   Here's what it looks like.
[02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:03.940]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:04.940]   That's a standard.
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:05.940]   Yeah.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:11.980]   It does the same weird filtering where it catches light in the weirdest ways.
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:12.980]   It's beautiful.
[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:14.020]   It's art in and of itself.
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:15.780]   I love it so much.
[02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:19.060]   So, yeah, you can get the Mandalorian model if you're a Star Wars fan.
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:20.700]   I didn't get it.
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:23.260]   I restrained myself, but I did get the film.
[02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:25.620]   I went ahead and bought the pack of films.
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:30.700]   So I'll be probably using the film this weekend to take pictures of whatever I'm doing.
[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:34.940]   And despite what you might have heard about the cost of licensing Star Wars characters,
[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:38.660]   it is no more expensive than a regular eye type.
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:39.660]   So they are.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:40.660]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:42.940]   Yeah, which is weird.
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.740]   Yeah, because usually licensing costs.
[02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:47.620]   I think the film itself costs more money.
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:49.660]   They make so much money on the film.
[02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:51.860]   That's really the, that's really the game here.
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:52.860]   They give it like more.
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:53.860]   It's so expensive.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:54.860]   Yeah.
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:55.860]   It's like $2 a print.
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:57.860]   Oh, they still sell it anyway.
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:15:58.860]   But I love it anyway.
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:04.020]   Now, is this the old same old Polaroid or is this a fake Polaroid?
[02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:07.540]   These ones right here that you're looking at are actual vintage cameras.
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:15.220]   These are from the year that they, this company restores old Polaroid cameras, but they also
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:23.500]   have new cameras, which is they have the eye type and one other the H type or something
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.500]   like that.
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:25.500]   And they're very similar.
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:29.540]   But, but yeah, so what you're looking at are restored action.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.300]   I remember this vividly.
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:32.300]   My parents had this.
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:33.900]   This is a big deal.
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:35.900]   This is this was like the iPhone.
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:36.900]   Oh, look at that.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:37.900]   The iPhone of the day.
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:38.900]   Oh, it is.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:42.060]   It's like, oh, oh, look at that.
[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:43.300]   I've got the sonar model.
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:45.300]   Oh my God.
[02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:47.420]   And somebody has Matt finished yours.
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:48.420]   Look at that.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:50.260]   The leather, the leather needs some restoration.
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:54.780]   I got the MIT flea market 10 bucks.
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:55.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:59.180]   This is I, I only run it works.
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:02.740]   I've only run like actually you can probably hear like the dead battery from the last pack
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:03.740]   of film.
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:04.740]   Yeah, so you can hear.
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:05.740]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:06.740]   The film has the battery.
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:07.740]   Yeah.
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:08.740]   Actually, it was just a picture.
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:11.420]   Oh, I love that sound.
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:14.700]   But it's it's ancient film.
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:15.700]   So it probably didn't work.
[02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:22.220]   Like I said, I think I was able to find like one pack of film for like $30 and even that
[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:25.980]   was probably about what it would have cost back in the day.
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:30.540]   So what I wonder, I've never been able to figure it out is whether or not the new the
[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:36.140]   600 film that you can get is that compatible with your retro camera so that you can actually
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:37.580]   use it all the time.
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:43.000]   Because I know you can't you even if you buy just like you did, you buy an old pack of
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.900]   Polaroid film, the film itself is destroyed.
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:47.220]   So you're never going to take good picture.
[02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:50.700]   You're going to get like two out of 10 are going to be good pictures because the film
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:52.060]   itself is destroyed.
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:57.380]   But I wonder if you could use brand new, you know, 600.
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:18:02.540]   They say to power your vintage camera.
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:05.380]   So yeah, Andy, I should.
[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:06.380]   Oh, that's not bad.
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:07.540]   I should buy a couple.
[02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:08.540]   1899.
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:09.540]   Yeah.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:12.940]   The last see the last I checked into it, which was like a while I was 50 film.
[02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:14.180]   They also X X 70 film.
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:18.100]   There was there was a company that was that it bought like a whole bunch of like manufacturer
[02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:20.660]   equipment and we're trying to like reformulated.
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:25.740]   And the reward was that it kind of works, but it's so such a low ISO that you really
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:28.140]   need just like really, really bright daylight.
[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:33.180]   But for 19 bucks, I'm going to buy a pack or two and see because the cool thing is because
[02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:39.060]   the cool thing is like this was such a great idea because on top of everything else, well,
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:44.740]   it was it was ecologically really, really wasteful because the film pack also contained
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.860]   like a five volt battery that powers the entire camera.
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:53.020]   So like with the with the with the cartridges out, it's like this is a completely like dead
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:54.020]   object.
[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:58.020]   And so every time you every time you threw you took your 10 pictures and then threw away
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:03.100]   like the empty like film frame into the Disney World, you're throwing out a five volt battery
[02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:08.140]   that was actually not only full of chemicals, but also had a lot of like real life left
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:09.580]   into it.
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:11.340]   But yeah, thank thank you.
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:13.900]   This is going to be expensive for me because yeah, now I'm going to have to like buy some
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:15.540]   film packs.
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:16.540]   It's hard to me.
[02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:22.180]   It's nostalgia at its best slash worst because there is no planet there.
[02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:27.820]   But it's there's because there's no planet in which spending that's what a dollar 30 per
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:32.540]   print on a print that's nowhere near as good as what I would take on my phone eight years
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:33.540]   ago.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:37.420]   But yeah, like it like it just found out like be able to do this and that's now it's unfolded
[02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:41.540]   and deployed and then taking a picture and let's see if I've got another.
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:43.900]   Oh, look at that.
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:45.540]   That must have been the last one.
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:52.140]   But yeah, the magic of well, actually, you know, this is actually like the hell is that
[02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:55.580]   it's it's just it's hard.
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:20:00.300]   Whatever that is that's our chemicals were like in this like sort of like a like a foil
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:02.940]   ketchup packet in the back on the bottom here.
[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:04.900]   So this is the unexposed film.
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:09.740]   And so when you take a picture, rollers would like squeeze the chemicals evenly like across
[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:11.780]   the whole thing and those the developer chemicals.
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:14.300]   That's why I took like a half a minute to a minute to expose.
[02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:17.900]   There are a lot of people who are doing art that way where they would take pictures and
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:24.260]   then like get like the the blunt end of a ballpoint pen and just like rub rub images
[02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:28.780]   and like patterns on it because that would mess mess up the colors and the details and
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:30.820]   how things would be how things would be delivered.
[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:33.060]   But actually that's that's not too bad, man.
[02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:35.700]   I might I might have to frame a rank amateurs.
[02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:43.660]   If I were taking I would get the eight by 10 large format Polaroid camera and go out
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:46.900]   on the road, get a hood to put over my head.
[02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:49.460]   Wow, that's a camera.
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:52.780]   I think if you're going to get that you're going to have to get like that big like tub
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:54.620]   of magnesium on a stick.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:55.620]   Smile.
[02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:59.020]   Oh man, I would love that.
[02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:00.020]   Oh man.
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:02.380]   But yeah, this is I mean, it's it's no joke.
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:08.180]   This was Polaroid was the apple of the 70s and this was like again like an iPod or like
[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:09.180]   an iPhone.
[02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:14.780]   It was just such a beautiful and magical sort of thing that people did not understood why
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.860]   this and this by the way, this is an SLR.
[02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:21.860]   This is not what when you look through here, you're looking through like the film, the
[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:23.580]   the light paths to the film.
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:25.220]   So that was absolutely no joke.
[02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:27.300]   So you're not you're losing.
[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:28.300]   Yeah.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:30.020]   Anyway, about to.
[02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:34.380]   My ticket of the week is who wants to buy this for me for $200.
[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:39.780]   But yeah, no, it was it was like I was even even at the MIT fleet, these kind of go for
[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:44.100]   I think about this five years ago and they even then they were growing for like 50, 60,
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:46.060]   70, 80 bucks.
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:50.580]   But I managed to find that it was for me it was in the 10 or $20 price range and was
[02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:52.540]   like, no way I'm not buying this.
[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:54.460]   You're also I'm sorry, I'll stop babbling.
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:56.860]   I just remembering how cool I think this is.
[02:21:56.860 --> 02:22:02.420]   You can actually buy like replacement like I remind myself that I found a store on eBay
[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:06.140]   that actually makes like replacement leather where it's like decal.
[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:09.220]   So if you like managed to peel and scrape this off, you can like upgrade the leathers
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:10.220]   back to the way they were.
[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:13.380]   Because yeah, this looks like zombie.
[02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:16.260]   This is perfect for Halloween zombie leather.
[02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.260]   Yes.
[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:21.340]   My pick of the week is something I just went through.
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:26.100]   I mentioned this a couple of times we decided the hell with it, if we're all going to be
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:30.740]   zooming and we're all going to be with, we're going to we're going to wire the house.
[02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:37.900]   So I got a guy to come out, run cat six cable from the attic and the crawl space drops at
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:46.940]   every conceivable place, not just the computer stations, but also the TV area and just everywhere
[02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:48.620]   we might want wiring.
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:54.460]   And then unfortunately we went to a company that does theater home theater, CD styles,
[02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:56.220]   installs and they talked me into it.
[02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:58.580]   It was I was a fool to go for it.
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:05.620]   Some kind of home theater brand equipment from a company called Arachnus and I was, you
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:07.740]   know, I couldn't control it at all.
[02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:10.700]   So I said, please take this back.
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:11.820]   I don't want it.
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:16.580]   And I talked to Russell and I talked to John and they said, you need ubiquity.
[02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:19.420]   So I went out and I got a unify system.
[02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:23.060]   And I have to say there's actually an iPhone angle on this, which I'll show you in just
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:24.060]   a second.
[02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:26.340]   There's a great iPhone app, but you can also log in.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:28.980]   This is my network.
[02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.580]   And I can, you can see the whole thing.
[02:23:30.580 --> 02:23:32.940]   This thing works so well.
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:36.500]   And the software is so cool.
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:41.780]   Makes it very easy to do things like create separate VLANs for the IoT devices.
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:47.820]   Here's a map of all the devices connected and what's connected to what I've slowly been
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:50.660]   going through and naming devices.
[02:23:50.660 --> 02:23:53.260]   You can see what everything is doing.
[02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:57.140]   You can, if you're on a VLAN, you can move things around.
[02:23:57.140 --> 02:24:05.260]   It's really a beautiful, beautiful system with incredible, sophisticated, additional
[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:08.060]   tools for internet security.
[02:24:08.060 --> 02:24:09.340]   There's threat management.
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:13.020]   There's geographic IP filtering.
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.300]   There's deep packet inspection.
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:17.140]   There's of course a firewall.
[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:22.660]   But if you have an iPhone and the iPhone app, you're going to love this.
[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:28.300]   I can't demo it, so I'm taking somebody's video from the internet.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:32.860]   But this supports AR with the iPhone.
[02:24:32.860 --> 02:24:38.860]   So what you do is you capture your whole rack in the viewfinder.
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:41.620]   And then the iPhone says, "All right, I got it."
[02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:49.780]   And now as you pointed at the ports, it will show you what each port is connected to.
[02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:54.780]   That's a second.
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:25:04.900]   Now he sees his 16 port PoE switch and he can see in augmented reality what it's all plugged
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:05.900]   into.
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:06.900]   This is completely worthless.
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:09.700]   But so cool.
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:15.020]   So if you have an iPhone, well, you just got to go out and buy a unify system because
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:16.420]   it's pretty neat.
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:21.420]   Actually, I'm very happy.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.420]   The speeds are fantastic.
[02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:28.660]   The reliability I'm told by everybody who uses them is very good.
[02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:33.020]   And they now have -- it's kind of an enterprisey gear.
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:38.420]   It used to be that you'd have to run a separate controller on a Java machine on your windows
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:40.420]   or Mac or Linux box.
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:45.420]   That's all built into the Dream Machine, which is their newest system.
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:47.300]   My fax was built in.
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.740]   It's just a little tube.
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:55.620]   So if you're looking to replace -- I think where this really is going to hit home is
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:59.100]   with people who have airport extremes.
[02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:02.180]   And they're just going, "What do I do now?
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:03.900]   How do I replace this?"
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:05.420]   And I think the Dream Machine is great.
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:08.300]   You can easily add more switches.
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:14.980]   The access points use power over ethernet.
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:19.020]   So all you have to do is drop an ethernet cable wherever you want them to be.
[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:21.500]   And you can expand this very easily.
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:24.300]   So it used to be something that was just outrageously expensive.
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:28.300]   And now I think with the quality of the software and what they're doing.
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:32.100]   Now, if you do this, you have to get a switch so you can do the augmented reality.
[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:34.180]   But I think it's pretty good.
[02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:36.020]   I am very, very happy.
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:37.860]   I'm using a Dream Machine Pro.
[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:45.340]   And I ended up buying a 48 port -- you've been putting 48 port POE switch, lots of little
[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:48.140]   switches, five access points.
[02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:49.140]   And the house is humming.
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:55.780]   I mean, literally, you could feel the electricity coursing through you.
[02:26:55.780 --> 02:27:00.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:03.180]   I want to thank you all for joining us.
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:08.300]   A tip of the hat to Renee Ritchie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:12.740]   Look forward to seeing everything you've got going, including your brand new show.
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:16.140]   What is the name of the show you're doing with Georgia?
[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:17.340]   Besides -- Apple Talk.
[02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:18.340]   -- GNR.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:19.340]   Apple.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:20.340]   Apple Talk.
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.340]   Apple Talk.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:22.340]   Is that good?
[02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:23.340]   Are you going to keep with that?
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:24.900]   Stay with that?
[02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:25.900]   I think so.
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:29.980]   I mean, we have an Apple topic and a tech topic and then some fun stuff at the end.
[02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:34.980]   And I cover Apple, so it's just -- Georgia talks really well, so I figured it's a good
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:35.980]   name.
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:36.980]   -- She talks, you're Apple.
[02:27:36.980 --> 02:27:37.980]   It's --
[02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:39.500]   -- Actually, Srenity Caldwell came up with it.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.340]   It was a name of a podcast we did a long time ago.
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:45.700]   And then I asked her blessing to use it for this, and she very kindly obliged.
[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:46.700]   -- Nice.
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:48.740]   994 subscribers.
[02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:50.740]   Let's get to 1,000 before we wrap the show.
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:52.140]   What do you say?
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:56.620]   YouTube.com, search for Apple Talk with Georgia and Renee.
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:27:58.620]   Or as Del Rimple calls you, Renee.
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:02.860]   -- I love you.
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:04.460]   Thank you so much, Laurie Gill.
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:06.820]   Great to have you managing editor at iMore.
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:09.740]   Did your review go up of the Apple Watch?
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:10.740]   -- It did.
[02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:12.540]   You can find it on iMore.com.
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:13.540]   -- It shall look perfect.
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:15.900]   -- Actually, it's iMore.com/AppleWatchSeries6Review.
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:20.100]   There's a slash between each one of those words.
[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:23.540]   -- Okay, well that makes it easy to find.
[02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:24.900]   I guess.
[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:25.900]   Thank you, Laurie.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:26.900]   Really appreciate your being here.
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:29.620]   Of course, thanks so much to Andy and Aco.
[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:32.180]   When are you going to be on GBH in Boston next?
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:33.620]   -- A little late this week.
[02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:38.380]   I'm going to be on-- actually a little early, I'm sorry, this week, Thursday at 1.20pm.
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:42.940]   Go to wgbasenews.org to stream it live or later.
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:44.380]   -- Nice.
[02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:47.220]   We do Macbreak Weekly on Tuesdays.
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:53.620]   Some time in the window between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Tuesdays.
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:58.620]   It's supposed to be 11.
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:01.380]   Remember, you can watch us produce the show.
[02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:03.540]   This isn't actually the content.
[02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:06.940]   If you want to watch us in our live stream, go to twit.tv/live.
[02:29:06.940 --> 02:29:08.180]   There's live audio or video.
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:11.380]   You can listen as well as watch.
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:15.620]   And like I said, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:17.060]   It's not going to be before then.
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:18.260]   Let's put it that way.
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:20.740]   Be there or after.
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:25.380]   One of our big Apple Day, because we start with iOS today around 9 a.m. Pacific.
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:27.060]   You can get on-demand shows.
[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:28.620]   Don't ever worry about the timing.
[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:32.180]   If you get an on-demand show, you can listen whenever it's convenient to you.
[02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:33.780]   They're available in a variety of places.
[02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:36.420]   You can always go to the website twit.tv.
[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:40.420]   For this show, it's twit.tv/mbw.
[02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:41.820]   You can of course go to YouTube.
[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:45.300]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Macbreak Weekly.
[02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:48.380]   All 500 of you subscribers, thank you.
[02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:55.380]   You can also get it on your Siri or your Google Voice or your Amazon Echo device by
[02:29:55.380 --> 02:29:59.380]   asking for the Macbreak Weekly podcast.
[02:29:59.380 --> 02:30:02.940]   And if you subscribe in your favorite podcast application, you don't have to do any of
[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:03.940]   this rigmarole.
[02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:06.580]   You can just get it whenever it's ready.
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:09.860]   Just download it and listen or watch.
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:10.860]   Thanks for being here.
[02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:16.020]   Now I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:18.780]   Want more Twit? Well, check out Smart Tech today.
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:20.820]   It's at twit.tv/stt.

[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:26.300]   Smart Tech.
[02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:27.460]   It's automation.
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:29.180]   It's connected devices.
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:30.340]   It's Smart Home.
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:32.660]   It's all those goodies and so much more.
[02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:33.900]   We get the news.
[02:30:33.900 --> 02:30:35.540]   We get the latest devices.
[02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:36.900]   We do reviews.
[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:37.900]   Everything.
[02:30:37.900 --> 02:30:38.900]   You've got to check it out.
[02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:40.860]   Twit.tv/stt for Smart Tech today.
