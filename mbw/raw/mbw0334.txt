[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.520]   put out the roadmap for Apple's product releases in 2013 and we'll look ahead to Apple's big
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.480]   quarterly earnings report for tomorrow. It's all ahead on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   It's time for this, what the hell the name of this show is, Mac Break Weekly, this week in Mac.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   Why do I want to call it that? I don't know why.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   I don't know why.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   Oh, I know why, because the old timer's here.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   The man who named Mac Break Weekly, Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore Hi, Alex.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   How's it going?
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   You are so rarely in town now.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   I am, but I'm back.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   And we're grateful for you.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   Maybe even the next couple weeks.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   Some say, though, some say that perhaps, you know, we named Mac, when it was a first Mac Break, it was in 2006.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   In 2006.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   That was January.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   So back then, there was no iPhone. There was no iOS. It was Mac.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   It really was.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Break Weekly.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Now, it really should be, I don't know, iOS Ecli.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   iOS, I don't know.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   Because Mac Break's is the easier.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   We've talked about changing the name for a couple of years.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   You can't change the name.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   But the problem is, is that we can't think of something that would be better.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   You can't change the name.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   Right.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Also with us Renee, Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Up in Montreal. Hello, Renee.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Hi, Leo. How are you?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   He was up late, re-recording his show last night.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   Again, again.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   This is Apple Stuff Leo. I'm doomed, but I'm selling more than ever.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   And I don't know how to reconcile those two facts.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Doned!
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Yeah, let's talk about Apple being doomed.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Also, Andy and Akos here was so nice to have you on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   Everybody should listen. You're fabulous.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   You're quite fabulous yourself, Leo.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   And for those watching on video, Andy sounds great.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   For those watching on video, that beautiful Minecraft edition of Andy and Akos.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   Andy and Akos, the Lego edition.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   This is the last time you will see it.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Oh, really?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Well, or at least if we see this next week, then we can definitely, we can definitely start
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   blaming Skype and Verizon again.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Because tomorrow my uplink goes from about three to four megabits to 25.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   So what did you get?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   You get Fios?
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   Fios Superman level bandwidth.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   And there is actually even one level higher than that if I need it to really be arrogant
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   about bandwidth.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   I don't think Skype uses more than 20 megabits up per second.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   It seems like that would be more than it would be.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   The thing is, I got the best that was available when I first set up my servers a few years ago.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   So it was certainly long past time for me to revisit that anyway.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   But at this point, it's like, okay, if it's not, if we have silver problem next week, it's
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   definitely Skype.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   It's definitely something specific to my service.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   Or just that I count amongst God's unbeloved.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   Although, you know, Steve Gibson has a lot of bandwidth because he has like a direct connection,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   a spigot, if you will, to the backbone.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   But because he has all this stuff going on, he often has problems because he's conditioning
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   it and massaging it.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   It's like the Kobe beef of bandwidth.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   It's like, so he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he, he, he keeps battery farms as bandwidth,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   force feeds it more gran than possible.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   We consume it and then kills it while it's y'all.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   And it's, it's actually capable of, of very good connection.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   I mean, you see, like when I'm at one, at those events and I, and I hooks.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   You probably don't worry about this in anything else.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   You're streaming all the time from all sorts of crazy places.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   I mean, we, we do a lot of two-way communication and, and I mean, the big thing is, is making sure
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   that there is nothing between you and the internet.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Right.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   So, so, so, that's the key.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   And that's what's, problem with steam.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   No firewall.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   No, no, no.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   You know, so like when we, you know, we'll let, we're going to businesses all the time and
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   say, we need you to punch a whole, you know, we need you to build a VLAN that punches a
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   whole through your firewall just for this one port.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   Right.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   You know, like, you know, you just plug this in and this doesn't touch anything else until
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   it hits the internet.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   You know, or you put in a box that lets you, um, yeah, control, basically prioritize what
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.080]   we call prioritize the packets and decide, you know, from this port when someone plugs
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   into here, they get all the bandwidth and everything else has, everybody else has to
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.200]   share whatever's left, you know, and that's the, those are some, some of the stuff that
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.560]   it's kind of my day to day.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.320]   That must, that must be part of the fun of being Alex Lindsay, like showing up and then
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.920]   someone says, oh, don't worry, the hotel promised us they have wifi everywhere.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.120]   How, how often have I heard that?
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.680]   So, and, and, um, in, uh, just as an example for CES, we, um, almost bullied the high, what
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.040]   used to be the high, the, the, um, the, whatever the Las Vegas hotel, L.B.H.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.600]   They don't call them the, there was like two days of bullying to talk to them to, to make,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.360]   to make, to make sure that we actually got the bandwidth we asked.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.480]   And then we still didn't trust them.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   So we microwaved another 10 megs, um, to the window, um, you know, from, from another
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.560]   building in Las Vegas.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.680]   And so, um, so anyway, that was the, uh, but that's, you do microwave it?
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   Yeah, we microwaved it.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   Wow.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   Look, for the receiver at the window.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.480]   Because I remember you told me what you had it like, uh, I had one connection.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.280]   No, no, no, no, we only had, we had 10 up and down to the window and then we had like
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   the window, the window, the window, the window.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   And, um, this was like, this was like something out of like, oceans, 14, like, don't cheat
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.200]   to like rent, like, open some McDonald's, like across the street just so they could
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   aim a beam.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.240]   What I'm going to tell you, I, I'd like to say that though, that's been the hardest
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   connection we've had.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.000]   It's just not, you know, so that, that's actually a pretty straightforward.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.560]   We work with a company called Straight Up Technologies.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   They do most of that for us.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.920]   They're kind of our, our, uh, that's a black art.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.160]   Especially who's an expert on bandwidth, it's like RF, radio frequency is the same thing.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.280]   I mean, anything, but he's an expert in these things.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.880]   Because it's not, it's not deterministic or it probably is, but we just, they're so
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   good chaotic.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   There's so many variables.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.960]   You can't see the, you know, the causality of stuff.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.520]   You just have to kind of, you kind of sense it.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.320]   There's a lot of, it seems, you might as well have a dowser with a, well, and you just
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   have to know that there are so many things around.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   I sense bandwidth.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.320]   Here it is.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   Well, and we're just, there's some other little back crackies.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   I'm going to shoot damage.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   Shut up.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   You guys jumped my bandwidth claim.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.920]   Well, and all of us are walking around.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.680]   Like all of us, uh, constantly, every city we go into, every place we go, we're constantly
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   checking bandwidth.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680]   Like, what is the bandwidth like here?
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.680]   What's the LTE?
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.680]   What's the LTE?
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.120]   Like, and it comes up in the weirdest places.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.240]   Like we were in, I was in Tahoe over the weekend and, uh, the apartment, the apartment that
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.680]   we got there, it's like 20 down and 10 up.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   I was like, I could do it.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680]   I guess from here.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   Resin LTE?
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.120]   No, that was the, oh, the rising LTE was like eight, eight or eight up and down.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   I mean, this was, this was the Wi-Fi.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   That's wild or whatever.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.400]   And it was, um, but that's because nobody was there yet or something or everybody was
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   skiing.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.360]   It was, but we were downloading movies and it was, but, but the, um, uh, uh, but anyway,
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   but it's just interesting.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.920]   So we're constantly obsessed.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.480]   That's the one thing that we're obsessed with constantly because it is the hardest thing
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   to sort out.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.480]   Sessed with bandwidth.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   And it's all about pace.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.160]   Have you heard of pace?
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   What's that?
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Primary York City.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   You have your primary alternate.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   That's pace.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   That's taco sauce.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.920]   That's also made in New York City.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   It's taco Tuesday.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   It's on my mind.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.760]   Does anyone, does anyone, does anyone, does anyone on the, on, in the chat know what
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760]   pace is.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.680]   Oh, I bet, I bet somebody that primary alternate, um, uh, your, um, so you have primary alternate
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   contingency.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.520]   That's why I look on the inter emergency.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.680]   Primary professional association for childhood education.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.560]   Primary alternate contingency emergencies.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.000]   You have four ways that's going to get done every single time and almost every event we
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.080]   have has, um, I like that have that primary alternate contingency contingency.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.920]   You'll be like the third one down emergency and emergency would be like, whoa, if it,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.640]   you know, and let's also for instance, emergency on our, on our end is typically a LTE modem
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   hook to our laptop.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.240]   That's like, like we don't want to use it, but we always show up with one.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.680]   You know, I have, I usually have Verizon and AT&T modems that I have, you know, UPS and
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.120]   blockchain here in Twitch, we use PAW.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.320]   We barely put barely mostly our balance P pretty much.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   And then maybe a little, uh, contingency.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   Yes.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.480]   Emergency is they go over to my house.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   And we have the emergency.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.760]   We do the whole show for my living room.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.000]   We have some cell phones.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Okay.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   What is our pace?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   We should think of our pace.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   All right.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.440]   But the reason we're stalling is because Apple's quarterly earnings call is tomorrow.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.120]   So we're going to keep on talking like this until tomorrow.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.400]   If we can get to tomorrow, there'll be some news.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.480]   Well, let's say, no, I was, I was going to interrupt earlier on because we're talking
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.960]   about names for the show.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.240]   Uh, and of course I've got like, I've got my, like Mac mini, like with just a dedicated
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.280]   Twitter feed next to me right here.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.560]   And there's already a couple of suggestions.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.920]   I hope it's not another Mac bleep weekly with a word, rude word on it about how we
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.840]   say nasty things about, uh, about Apple and, and, and Mac every week.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   So, so maybe we can say nasty things.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.720]   We say, we say critical things because so, cause sometimes it's not a fan show.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.920]   If you want a fan show, there are plenty of Mac Apple fan shows.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.240]   This is a news show.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.200]   And also we're not, you're performing monkey, sir.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.600]   We're not here to validate your decisions in life.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   We will not.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   But let's for you.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.520]   But, but, but perhaps we can start off by saying that is there, is there any announcement
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.160]   that could happen tomorrow that would change the fact that Apple is doing extremely well
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.120]   and is probably going to be doing extremely well for the next two or three years.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.560]   Well, is there anything that's going to, that's going to make us think that, ooh, I
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.120]   think I should start looking at windows eight for real now.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.720]   No, I can guarantee you not on that.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.480]   But, but, but of course what everybody's wondering, you know, and obviously the stock market
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   is weighed in.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.680]   We talked about this on Sunday with a $200 price drop, which is significant, uh, over
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   the last few months.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.480]   And everybody's wondering is, is Apple kind of out of runway?
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.280]   And are they now going to be facing a normal market environment where there's a lot of
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.120]   real competition instead of just owning?
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.040]   I mean, they've, it's so dominant, uh, and they've really owned everything.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.920]   It's not a question of, is Apple going to go out of business tomorrow?
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.160]   It's not a question, but it might be a question of, is Apple going to look more like the post
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.520]   Steve Jobs era the first time than it does now?
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.640]   And the only advantage they have now is that a post Steve Jobs, except that they have 120
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   billion dollars.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.960]   So, I mean, the question is, is that are they just going to burn that out?
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   I mean, Microsoft had a huge, still has a huge amount.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.040]   I mean, Microsoft can run for the next century.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.400]   Just, yeah, like, look at my question is, does Apple stay relevant in the way that they're
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   leading the industry?
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.600]   Let me, let me say in a way that Apple fans will, uh, not get mad.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.960]   Look at Microsoft.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.920]   Here's a company that is really struggled.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.680]   Their stock price is flat at like nothing.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.680]   Right.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.600]   Uh, and it has not been able to break out, but it's not out of business.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.520]   It's not going away.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   It's still the dominant operating system by far.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.360]   So you can coast for a long time.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.760]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.640]   But what we really are saying is Apple fanatics is people who really care about Apple with
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   their Apple.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   And I think I think to answer your question, Andy, and then I'll let you talk to answer
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.120]   your question.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.760]   Part of the problem with this tomorrow's results is they don't reflect the whole holiday season,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   right?
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.680]   What do they, what do they reflect through October, November, December?
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.960]   I think they do.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.440]   So I believe it's a holiday quarter.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   It is the holiday quarter than it was last year, but it's still the holiday quarter.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.200]   But it won't, but you know, I mean, they came out with the iPhone five late in that,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.640]   you know, it was, it was in that within that quarter, right?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.960]   Or just to just to around that quarter.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.680]   Um, we did see, we did get Verizon's results today though, and they sold 9.8 million smartphones
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.760]   in their Q4 and 6.2 million of them were iPhones.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.360]   So three out of every five phones they sold were smartphones.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.840]   They sold were iPhones.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.160]   And this is when Apple is doomed.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.560]   So I'm guessing if Apple wasn't doomed, it would have been six out of five.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   Well, no, wait a minute.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.920]   Are you sure it's, it says almost, according to the Mashable article, almost half of its
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.760]   activations were iPhone five.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   Oh, I see.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   63%.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.760]   Okay.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.280]   And that's the rest were mostly Android phones, small mix of Windows phones and maybe a Blackberry.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.680]   So that's good.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.280]   That's an early indicator.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.640]   And there was, I mean, I think there's, there's three areas that we typically look at Apple
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.640]   in.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.760]   One is market share, which they've never done well at.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.920]   You know, they were never the market share leader with the Mac.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.720]   When they first introduced the iPhone, Nokia and Blackberry were massive and Steve Jobs
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.960]   said we'd be happy with a few percentage points.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.120]   And now Android is massive.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.840]   Profit share, Apple has never had a problem with.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.320]   They're always hugely, under the jobs to era, they've always been hugely profitable.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.320]   But mind share is something that they grabbed a lot of when the iPhone launched.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.680]   And that is something that seems more vulnerable now.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.840]   It's the, not necessarily the financials, but the coolness factor and the sort of aura
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.800]   that Apple has that attracted a lot of people over the last few years now is maybe fragmenting
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.280]   between more players.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.640]   So I don't think anybody here would say Apple is doomed.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.240]   The only question is, is Apple on its, on the upswing, the downswing or hovering?
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.640]   Well, and I think that, I think that one of the things that we saw, and some people
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.520]   had talked about it, I'm sure we talked about it here too, but a lot of the end of the year
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.680]   stock dropped, I think a lot of people were saying, oh, Apple's stock is going down.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.520]   And a lot of that had to do with, had as much to do with tax policy in the United States
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.480]   as it did with anything that people thought about Apple.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.840]   A lot of people had huge positions in Apple and they're afraid of where the taxes are
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   going in the United States.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.760]   And so what they wanted to do is lock some of that profit in before they had to pay more
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.960]   taxes on it this year than they would have last year.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   Profit taking.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.120]   So there's a lot of profit taking there.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.080]   And so, and I think that they probably see that Apple, if anything, is going to slow down
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.480]   a little bit as far as, I mean, because they were astronomical for a while.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:50.200]   And even when you look at the stock rise over the last year, I believe the, even with Apple
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.680]   quote unquote losing hundreds of points or whatever, I think,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.880]   That were, what's at the beginning of the year?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   Is it?
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.880]   So the, oh, no, that's, that's this year.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   The beginning of this year.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.640]   Oh, oh, I'm saying if you look over the, over the last 12 months, I believe it's up by
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.320]   still 20 or 30%, at least.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   Okay.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   I wonder, you know, let me get this.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   Let me get this.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.720]   So anyway, so financing because find out when the last time Apple was at 500.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   Right.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   So that would be of interest.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.120]   So anyway, so I think that, you know, while it dropped, I think that there is, there was
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.680]   a fairly good growth over the, anyway, so there's a fairly good growth over the last
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.080]   year, you know, year to year.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.380]   I mean, healthy for a company that is one of the largest in the world from a market
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.380]   cap perspective.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.400]   It's a very, very aggressive growth rate.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.120]   On this day in nine, in 2012, they were at 427.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   Right.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.840]   So they're looking at a 20% perox, a little less than 20% growth.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.480]   So that's not still for a company that is the largest, one of the largest companies,
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.240]   that's, that's extremely, most of these companies, you know, measure their growth in, you know,
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   single, single digits.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.060]   But it's not just the stock prices, although it's partly, and maybe the stock prices influenced
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:03.640]   by the stories that iPhone 5 orders are down from the suppliers that the sharp is stopped
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   making iPad screens.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.200]   I mean, we're hearing stories out of China that Apple's ordering less product.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   So that's right.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   That's also where this comes from.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.400]   And some of that, the question really around that is, are there adjustments being made?
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.480]   You know, for instance, you know, maybe they over, maybe they predicted huge sales and they're
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.120]   only going to have giant sales.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   Exactly.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.520]   Well, and also the shift from the full size, you know, iPad to the iPad mini.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.700]   I mean, I barely use my full size iPad anymore.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.940]   So I think that there's a lot of people that have made that choice.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.420]   You know, and I think that that was, and I'm sure that Apple knew that that was going
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   to be successful.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.860]   The question is whether anyone was going to be as successful as they, as they as it has
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.860]   been.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.900]   So I think that that, and that'll be really interesting to see what numbers they give
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.580]   us related to iPad mini sales over this last quarter.
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.860]   That's something I'm going to be really fascinated to see, you know, how many clearly to me is
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.620]   the iPad of choice, right?
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.620]   We agree.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.080]   Obviously, all of us, all of us agree that it would be great to have a retina.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.320]   What would, so here's the big question though, if the iPad mini goes retina or if the big
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.480]   iPad gets a casing as thin and small and light as the iPad mini, then it's, it's blurrier
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.840]   again because you have a 9.7 inch screen that's very small, very tiny, very portable and a
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.120]   7.9 inch screen that's suddenly very good.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.280]   And then those products become more competitive, I think.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.800]   I don't think it becomes blurry at all.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.120]   I think that people are really very, very clear on the difference between a device like
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   this, which is sort of a notebook replacement and a device like this, which is very much
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.000]   like a media device.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.580]   The fact that so many people, again, Alex, you must, I think that if I were to even play
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.960]   back all my video and audio recorded secretly logs of all conversations I ever had with
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.200]   all my friends and family members, I think it would be almost 100% the people who are
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.700]   regular, 9.7 inch iPad users who then got a map iPad mini who almost never used the full-size
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.900]   version anymore.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.940]   So I really do think that this was just the, any smaller-sized tablet, anything that you
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.580]   can hold in one hand without being an NBA player, anything that you can conceivably stick
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.060]   in some pocket of some piece of clothing that you actually have that's not designed specifically
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.020]   for shoplifting purposes, I think that's a fundamentally different sort of thing.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.420]   And I think that this is going to, what I'm really looking forward to finding out tomorrow
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.580]   is if there's an indication of, is the iPad mini reaching out to people who were really,
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.860]   really on that fence before about the iPad or had dismissed the iPad before, is it bringing
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.100]   new people into the fold, people that had rejected the larger one, but this was, the
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.020]   mini was exactly the one that they wanted.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.260]   So I think that we're going to get a lot of really interesting information about what
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.260]   the so-called normal-sized tablet is.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.940]   I think that we might find out that a 10-inch tablet is actually the big tablet, it's not
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.780]   the normal-sized tablet, and it's the smaller one that people are actually looking for.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:49.060]   Yeah, I find it fascinating that, of course, I have a lot of different tablets that I'm
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.780]   playing with, but when my three-year-old daughter insists on the mini.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.060]   Well, Mersh, she's got the old baby in it.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.380]   She's like, "I want your tablet."
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.860]   I want the good one.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.020]   She says, "I want the good one," then that's different.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.140]   So when you see them at that age, they're making a quality decision about how they're
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.140]   what they're like.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.140]   Have I said this on this show?
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.980]   I've said it on every other show.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.780]   I think Apple's next product.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.780]   I'm predict.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.100]   I'm going to go on a limb here.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:24.020]   In March, we'll be an iPhone, iPhone, iPad mini, iPhone, and iPad mini with iPhone built
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.020]   in.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.020]   Did I say that yet?
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   You said it on Twitter.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.020]   You said it on Twitter.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.420]   I don't think you said it on this show.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.900]   I'm not sure that I agree.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.540]   If you're talking about this only with phone features, I'm not really sure.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.980]   Not for everybody.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.900]   You can still have your crappy little iPhone 5.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.900]   But Apple doesn't work that way.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.900]   But Apple doesn't work that way.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.900]   Oh, you want it, but Apple won't do it.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:53.780]   I'm saying that I'm a real big fan of -- I've been no secret before.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.860]   I'm a big fan of the larger screen phones.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.780]   I love this 4.8-inch screen.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:03.860]   The Note 2, I have one on loan that is tempting me to actually acquire one for real.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.660]   I do think that Apple's missing the boat by creating phones that still have small screens
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.660]   on them.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:15.060]   However, the idea of making this a discrete phone product is going to be -- I think it
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.220]   would be a really bold move for Apple to do it.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.380]   It would say that they're no longer willing to only produce products that they absolutely
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.460]   100% have faith in.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.740]   They're now willing to say, "We don't know whether people want a small phone, a large
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.660]   tablet, a small tablet, or a small phone tablet.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.580]   So we're just going to make as many things as we can and let people pick."
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.980]   I do think -- I'm sorry, just to cap it off.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.260]   I do think that it's inevitable that Apple's going to move away from the form factor they
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.260]   have for the iPhone 5.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.180]   I do think they're going to have to move towards something that's closer to this, even if it's
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.300]   not like a huge Note 2 sort of form factor.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.900]   I do think they're going to make this bigger -- the iPhone bigger for real instead of just
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   making it longer.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.340]   I think from a phone perspective, I think that -- and I wrote a lot about this on G+
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.340]   post that I put up.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.580]   But the -- I think that what's missing for Apple right now when it comes to the phone
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.220]   is unifying the FaceTime effect of being able to call someone.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.620]   Like, I don't want to use FaceTime, but I do want to call them.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.620]   And I just want to use Wi-Fi, or I just want to use my 3G or 4G.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.740]   The thing is I want to bypass all the minutes, I want to bypass -- I just want it to be a
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.740]   data call.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   And I want to have that phone call.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.740]   Well, you can do that right now with a mini.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.500]   I mean, you don't need to -- anything special.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   You can, but it's not just like --
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.460]   By the way, the thing is, Dell carriers are moving in that direction, too.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.660]   That's what LTE is all about.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.900]   LTE currently doesn't carry voice, but that's the plan.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.180]   And then they're just a data network.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.300]   So what I don't understand right now -- I guess the issue right now is that it's not as easy
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:45.980]   as with -- like, if I dial somebody with -- if I dial someone else with an iPhone or an
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.140]   iPad or if I want to call a computer, a Mac or whatever, I want to have that be just
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.620]   something that is super simple and I don't want to bring up a video screen.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.420]   You know, I just want to dial the number and get them wherever they route it to, you know,
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.500]   in their .Mac account or whatever, or all of them or whatever it is.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.500]   But I want to be able to -- the idea of calling a computer, an iPad or a phone, to me, should
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.260]   be completely seamless of I want to contact that person.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.660]   But right now, it feels like it's all leaning towards video.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.820]   You know, so it's all like, you know, the FaceTime is the easy -- I want to call that
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.820]   person, boom.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.740]   I don't -- the thing right now is that I just feel like it's this onerous process, whereas
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.260]   I just dial their number and it just calls them via Wi-Fi.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.700]   It's just a data call all the time.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.700]   And the reason that that's important to me, of course, is that I spend a lot of time overseas.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.740]   And so if I have a data connection that I'm paying for, I don't want to have to pay for
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.740]   $4 a minute, you know, to make that go away.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.940]   Also, I think that it's -- people want more flexibility.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.620]   They don't really think about a telephone number for a person to think of that person.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.620]   Right.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.860]   And I really wish that iMessage worked the way that Apple kind of promised it would last
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.100]   year.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:55.700]   Because let's say that you -- God forbid that you want to use iMessage on your iPhone
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:02.260]   sometimes, but on iDevices other times, and you don't necessarily want -- you want a
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.260]   certain amount of clarity.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.500]   You want to simply say, "Please direct all my iMessage traffic for whatever reason to this
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.540]   device and not all the rest of them."
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.540]   It becomes such a -- such a hori mess because I recently changed my data plan so that I
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.140]   can move my sim from one device to another.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.060]   So this is something you would be -- not something that most people are dealing with,
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.060]   but if you move -- let's say you switch away from the iPhone to something else.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.660]   Let's say you decided that, "Hey, I really do like the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.940]   Let's say I really -- you really do like something else."
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.780]   Now iMessage gets confused as to when it should contact you via a text message -- excuse
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.180]   me -- when someone should be sending something to you as a text message, when it should be
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.420]   sending to you as an iMessage, it's like yikes.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.260]   It should really figure that out a lot easier.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.980]   I should be able to go to a universal setting and say, "Hi, yes.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.060]   Anytime someone is trying to contact me via the iMessage service, if I'm logged in and
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.580]   active onto this device, otherwise send it as a text message."
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.660]   And you know this, by the way, is why not the stock price, not the -- whether or not they're
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.260]   ordering fewer iPads or iPhones, but this is to why me, I'm a little worried about Apple.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.180]   I used to have that feeling that Apple will solve this.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.660]   You're going to do something great.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:10.300]   I have no longer have any confidence at all that Apple will be able to solve this problem
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.940]   and make something that we want to use.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.500]   I just have lost confidence in Apple, not that anybody else out there is any better.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.940]   In some ways, lost confidence in the tech industry as a whole.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.380]   Apple, it should come up with innovative, interesting solutions.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.380]   It used to be that Apple really did.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.420]   You just was, "Oh, I never --" you know, they thought about it better than we would.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.420]   Right.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.420]   Yes, they used to have this huge respect.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.420]   They were ahead of us.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.420]   Apple saw that.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.020]   It's the great Steve, we'll figure it out.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.860]   And you don't -- you just -- at least I, and maybe it's just me, don't have that feeling
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.860]   anymore.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.860]   I think there was a rosy glow effect when we look back over time.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.060]   I mean, I remember things -- people complain about skeumorphism now, and I remember brush
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.060]   metal from that.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.060]   Brush metal.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.700]   That was the first skeumorphism, yeah.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.860]   It never worked right.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.140]   We had such a -- we had a great feeling towards it.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.500]   We had a lot of confidence, and it was psychology, and it was perception.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.020]   And I think that's the big difference between then and now is that we've decided for some
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.740]   reason, it's like, you know, after Buster Douglas knocks out Mike Tyson, suddenly everyone
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.380]   who was afraid of him thinks, "Oh, maybe I can knock him out, too."
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.180]   It's a change in universal perception.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.140]   And things like Andy was mentioning, a palm had synergy for a while where you take all
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.460]   your messaging, put it into little silos, but manifest it all in one unified interface.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:24.580]   And there's all these great software ideas, but Apple was stuck scraping Google off their
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.660]   phone and setting up Passbook and outsourcing their social networks last year.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.940]   And now this year they've got to work on that for iOS.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:36.140]   Passbook's a great example of a solution that doesn't do anything that it promises.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.740]   It's stuck on the third party that feeds --
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   It works pretty quickly.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.740]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.740]   Web apps are horrible that feed -- yeah, sorry.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.300]   Well, the web apps that -- Passbook itself is fantastic.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.580]   I drive up to Starbucks.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.340]   They scan me, and I'm gone.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.660]   The apps that you use to put stuff into, and in some cases get out of Passbook, are these
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.220]   horrible little web apps with tiny buttons that want all your PayPal and login information
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.900]   and tiny little fields.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.060]   And the stuff outside of Apple's control isn't as good as the stuff in their control yet.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.060]   I think Renee was spot on.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.700]   I think -- I would expand that to call it like the Simpsons effect, where no season
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.420]   of The Simpsons is as good as the first three seasons when you started listening to it.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:19.100]   Because you forget that out of 20 episodes of 22 episodes of season, there was the monorail
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.980]   episode that would become legendary.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.580]   There'd be eight that you'd really like.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.860]   There'd be five or six that you'd be like, "Okay, that was an off week."
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.420]   And then three where you're just, "Oh, dear, why don't I bother even finishing watching
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.420]   this?"
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.420]   I think that Apple's the same way.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.020]   I mean, if you go -- you don't have to go back too far to find years in which the
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.980]   I-Sync didn't really work properly.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:43.220]   It's been -- It's been a while since iTunes has been --
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.980]   as good an app as a lot of us would want it to be.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.620]   So I mean, I think that when you -- I think it's like, you know, the -- you were coming
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.700]   off -- we're still coming off the high of the iPhone, the high of the iPad, and we expect
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.580]   that now every single thing they do has to be the iPhone, has to be the iPad.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.740]   That said, I think it's very, very good that the Apple community of users is recognizing
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:09.740]   that there is no Magic Whiffle dust that makes them into this genius, Jesus-level organization.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:15.500]   They are a tech company that has a very, very clear idea of what they think technology
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.980]   should be.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.500]   Sometimes that idea is in sync with what you want and need.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.500]   Sometimes it isn't.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.380]   Sometimes they do it successfully.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.460]   Sometimes they don't.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.100]   But what keeps my faith in Apple is that I know that they always believe in the things
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.340]   that they do, and they always try very, very, very hard to give consumers the best experience
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.340]   possible.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.620]   Product over profit, I think.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.140]   And we're also in an era now where the things that are important are not the things that
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.060]   Apple has historically done well, things like cloud services.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.660]   And they're facing big challenges that they didn't have to face.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.500]   Or like Andy mentioned, I sync or back to my Mac years ago, and it's going to be a
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.300]   huge struggle to get those right.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.580]   We're going to take a break.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580]   Come back with more.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.940]   Renee Richie from iMore is here.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.300]   His Apple is doomed episode of the iMore podcast went out at midnight.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   Poor guy.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.300]   Dombed again.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   Again.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.980]   A wonderful surprise appearance from Alex Lindsey of Pixel Core.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.980]   Great to have you here.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.140]   It's going to be the original Mac Daddy of Mac Break Weekly and of course Andy Inako
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.140]   from Chicago.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.140]   Sometimes.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.900]   Pixelated for the last time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:27.020]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com, that great bookstore of audio books.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.020]   How many?
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.020]   Well over a hundred thousand.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.420]   I haven't counted recently.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.180]   It's probably, you know, I could do a search for all books.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.620]   I think that's what we did last time to figure out.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.140]   They're recorded in audio format that allows you to play them on almost anything.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:47.060]   There's an Audible app, which is fantastic, that lets you play the audio books on the
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.220]   iPhone, the Android phone and Windows phone.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.220]   Yes.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   Can I say something about that?
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   Yes, please.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.340]   I, for a long time, the first Audible app that came out wasn't super featured.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.340]   It's terrible.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.340]   I got into the habit.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.340]   That's horrible.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   It's all right.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.340]   It's trying to be nice.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.340]   Let's try to be honest.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.340]   It was unusable.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.340]   It was completely.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.580]   I just stuck with iTunes.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.660]   So I would just order all my Audible books through iTunes.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.460]   That turned out to be a big mistake.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.420]   If you're getting into Audible now, get the app.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.420]   Buy it through Audible.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.420]   Don't buy through iTunes.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.860]   The reason is now it's barely even referred to in your music section.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.900]   In iTunes, it's hard to find.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.620]   When you change and you don't have the connection correct or everything else, you lose all your
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.700]   books.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.020]   When you do it through Audible.com and you do it with their app, it means that it stays
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   in the cloud.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.500]   You can download it again.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.500]   It's like Kindle.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.100]   It's like everything's up there no matter when you bought it.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.100]   That's nice too.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.180]   All the books you've ever bought in Audible are always available in your life.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.860]   I can't even find where I bought.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.420]   I spent hundreds of dollars in iTunes on Audible books.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.980]   Now I'm having trouble getting.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:51.700]   So, the Audible.com and the new application that they have out at least on the iPhone
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.700]   is awesome.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.660]   I'm going to download it on my Android.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.820]   They have a Windows 8 app, a Metro app.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.820]   Those guys are crazy.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.820]   It's really nice.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.420]   They have the speed up so you can do 1.5, which is very important.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.780]   124,000 books.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.860]   I just did the count or titles I should say at Audible.com.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.980]   It goes up all the time.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.980]   It is an amazing resource.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.820]   If you spend time in the car driving, if you, you know, I listened at the gym, you know,
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.300]   on the Stairmaster, it's so boring that Audible is a lifesaver.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   Cleaning.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   Cleaning house.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   That's my big one.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.100]   I play it through the entire house really loud.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.620]   I can hear it in every room even over the vacuum cleaner.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:34.420]   I'm sure my neighbors are really enjoying Book Two of the King Killer Chronicles.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.980]   Let's say, you know, I have plenty of recommendations as anybody who's an Audible fan does, but
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.820]   let's, I always like to hear what Andy's listening to because he's got such, he's introduced
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.820]   me to more titles.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:50.340]   I just love his eclectic, you're not reading Francona the Red Sox years, are you?
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.580]   Terry Francona's biography day.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.380]   No, sports, sports biographies, and it's such a crap shoot for me because you never know,
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.860]   like, it's, it's great when they get like a lifelong friend of the athlete is who knows
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.220]   him very, very well and knows what stories to pull out of him are good.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.900]   It's another one when like there's a, you feel as well, there's a three hour conference
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.660]   call in which half of the stories are the public is like, okay, you can't remember.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.660]   You can't say that story.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.740]   Wait box drinking 28 beers on like one 10 hour flight back for a road.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.940]   You can't write about that.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.940]   You can't.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.420]   Now I will give you one that you, I'm sure you've read that is a classic more than 20
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.700]   years old now, Jim Bowtins, ball four.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.900]   And that is a horrible, I read that.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.420]   That was the, that was the, the story of the, the story of the saddle area picture.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.820]   It was like when the first like behind the scenes tell all books, it was, it was, it
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.100]   blew the lid off of major league baseball.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.420]   It wasn't really a tell all book.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.340]   It was more like somebody who's had amazing experiences and professional sports, but it
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.540]   was also an exceptional storyteller.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.980]   So it's not as though you're just talking up, but you just, the, the grinding old acts
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.300]   is or selling off whatever weird stories he has, be, to pay off whatever boat that he
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.540]   wished he hadn't bought before he blow out his, you know, blow out his knee or whatever.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.100]   So yeah, that was, that was a fantastic book.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.100]   I didn't know it was on Audible.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.100]   It is.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.740]   And Jim Bowtins reads it, which is going to be great.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:17.140]   It came out in 1975 and it, you know, it's often credited with creating free agency.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:23.140]   The book was used to test testimony during the arbitration hearings for free agency.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   So if you, if you kind of hankering from baseball, there's a great choice.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.460]   I have just, I finished no easy day.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:34.220]   If you saw, what is it, zero dark 30?
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:40.620]   The story is to a great extent based on this account by one of the SEAL team, six members.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.340]   It's really, it's also about being a SEAL team member, which is great.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.340]   Fantastic.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.340]   Put it down.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.540]   If you really know that also the SEAL team six, the book, SEAL team six is really good.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   Did I say CTM seven?
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.340]   No, I said six, I hope.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.660]   There's no, by the way, there's no one through five.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.460]   They're just SEAL team six.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.460]   Did you know that?
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.460]   There's a lot.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.460]   It's yeah.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.460]   In fact, they don't even call themselves that in the book.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.460]   He calls himself something else.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.460]   But anyway, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.460]   Doesn't matter.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.460]   Moneyball.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.460]   There's a great one.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.380]   And Michael Lewis is amazing book about the Oakland days.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.660]   They made a movie out of it and how Billy Bean at the Oakland days turned that team
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.660]   around.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.180]   And what are you reading, Andy?
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.540]   Actually, the, what I just started into was a book that was, just was re-released in
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.500]   audio just a couple of weeks ago, or at least rebranded Alfred Hitchcock and the making
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.500]   of Psycho.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.220]   Oh, I want to read that.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.020]   Because the movie with the Anthony Hopkins, they, I'm not sure.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.380]   I wasn't aware there was an audio before now.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.380]   It's one of the classic books of here is.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:48.940]   I love these biography type books that don't try to cover somebody from the birth to their
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.340]   moment of their death.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.500]   And that is tries to find an overarching theme with encyclical analyzing every scene in their
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   life.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.940]   I think the best biographies of the ones that say, well, here is one project they did.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.780]   Here is one four year, five years span.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.540]   And we're going to get so deep into this that we feel as though you're going to really
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.820]   know about this person by the time you get to the end of this project.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.540]   So this is about nothing but Alfred Hitchcock making Psycho.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:16.620]   Every decision that went into it, every influence he had, every argument he had with the studio,
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:23.340]   every bit of abusive and psycho controlling behavior that he exerted to get exactly what
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.820]   he wanted from from a lay and all and all the other characters.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:33.060]   I'm only about a couple of chapters into it right now, but it's it's already one of those.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.220]   You know, I was going to I was going to watch this two hour TV marathon tonight.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.180]   I think instead I will simply sit in my chair and listen to more audio of this because I
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.620]   want to know what happens right before the shower scene.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.780]   I want to know how this argument actually pays out.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.220]   There's lots of stories and you know, they just made a movie about.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.980]   Oh, no, that was about to be Henry and the birds.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.820]   No, no, well, two two came out the same time.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.940]   One of the girls, right.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.300]   And the other one is was starring Anthony Hopkins.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.380]   And can't remember her name.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:12.020]   Extra, the if this was super passport, all I would have to say is older English acts,
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.420]   actress, still hot.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   Yes.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.420]   I know who you're talking about.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.180]   Anyway, by the way, so many.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.180]   There's so many good books.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.460]   Here's I'm going to be listening to this.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.660]   You know, I'm going to the Super Bowl because Lisa is a big fan of the Niners and I guess
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.500]   the Niners won a game or something and we're going to New Orleans.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.580]   So I've got my next book is on Audible is a woman's guide to football.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.780]   How to talk his language?
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.780]   The basics.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.460]   I just got to hear a little bit of this because I think that I need this way.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.060]   Those maneuvers to keep people away from the guy on your team who's holding the ball are
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.300]   called blocks blocks.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.940]   The field is 100 yards long and 53 and a third yards wide.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.940]   Okay.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.740]   As you listen, imagine that the 100 yards runs right and left in your mind.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.740]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.900]   Think about this right and left 100 yards 50 yards.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.900]   Okay.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.900]   I got it 53 wide.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.780]   I'm trying to memorize this now.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.780]   Please.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.460]   That's a little bit like, you know, that's a little bit condescending.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.140]   It's like the football field is about the same proportions as I don't know, like a medium
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.540]   roasting pair.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.180]   Lisa's looking to be funny now.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.260]   In room at work.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.260]   I did.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.260]   I did buy the idiots.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.140]   No, the complete dummies guide to football.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.740]   I did buy that actually that I could use again.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.820]   I know it's the one where there's a ball and you're allowed to touch it with your hands
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:36.820]   and there's grass.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.700]   You know, you know, and I'd always end it.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.180]   It always interrupts amazing race.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.180]   That's all I know about football.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.940]   You know, in Pittsburgh, they have whole classes like support groups for women who are
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.420]   trying to, you know, what about men?
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.420]   What about what people like me?
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.260]   I'm a football widow or what's funny is it's only people who actually moved to Pittsburgh
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.580]   because all the women that already know Pittsburgh already understand the process.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:05.420]   The point here is audible has many, many choices and you can get, you can get, it's
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:11.380]   shaped somewhat like a chafing dish on your web and think of it as chafing dish filled
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.380]   with books.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.900]   It's like talking to your mother except that it's 53 yards wide.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   Yes, exactly.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.180]   And it's lots of useful tidbits.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.900]   Remember the time when you had company coming over, you were about to put the casserole in
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:29.180]   the oven, but some of it slopped over to the edges and time seemed to stop.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:34.300]   That's exactly what happens when a people person with the ball runs out about it.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.740]   Just like in the casserole.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.340]   Just like in the casserole.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.940]   Okay, I won't buy the woman's guide to football.

[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.900]   How would Jar Jar Bing's describe football?
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.900]   How would Jar Jar Bing's describe football?
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.140]   I told him I'd be like a...
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.140]   That's the problem.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.300]   You get to that voice when you're laughing.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.060]   But you think he's got this...
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.060]   He's passionate.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.060]   I'm second to...
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   No, I'm not good at it.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.060]   Hey, Jack, get him.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   You should play Bond.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.060]   He's just think that's a whole...
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.060]   That's a whole...
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.220]   Like Kingdom for a blaster.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.260]   Least with Disney.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.260]   Jar Jar will be...
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.260]   Yes.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.260]   Don't start a day morning cartoon.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.580]   Something like that.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.580]   This...
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.700]   Okay, next year at this time we're going to be commemorating the 30th anniversary of the
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   Apple Macintosh.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.700]   Crazy?
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:10.500]   Today we're actually the 19th in 1983 Apple unveiled two products.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.620]   Not as huge as the Macintosh.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.260]   The Lisa and the Apple IIE are 30 years old.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.460]   I got an Apple IIE.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.420]   The Apple IIE was the first computer I actually owned.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.060]   I think a lot of people watching that was the first computer.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.060]   The two...
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.300]   Apple was famous for it, but the IIE was a great computer.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.300]   It was color, right?
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   You don't even get me started.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.300]   My first color...
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   My dad...
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.300]   I told him I wanted an Apple IIE.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   Then he got it.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.300]   Then he got it.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.300]   I mean, a green monitor.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   So I knew that it was a color.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.300]   I had a green monitor.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.700]   I had a Apple II Plus also had a color.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.700]   The Apple II was a green color.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.700]   The Apple II Plus came out.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.580]   That was a big difference because the Franklin, which was the...
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.580]   You remember the...
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.580]   It had an on/off.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   And then so...
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.580]   Anyway, so I got the Apple IIE.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   The Apple IIE.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.500]   I had the Apple II Plus when my father's office had a Lisa.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.780]   I remember the first time I sat down, I just dragged everything to the trash can because
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.780]   it was so cool.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.780]   And you were never invited back.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   I was...
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.460]   Yeah, it was put away after that.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.780]   The Lisa, I remember standing in the window with my nose pressed to the glass, looking
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.780]   at the Lisa.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.780]   At the time, $9,995.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.540]   It was insane.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.460]   Which is in today's money, according to the article from the AP...
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.620]   No, Samantha Lyle writing a personal finance hub.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.620]   Today it would be $23,000.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.620]   20...
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.460]   So of course the Lisa didn't do very well.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.620]   Nobody's gonna spend $23,000 on a personal...
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.620]   Yeah, it was like...
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.620]   Two years ago.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   Two thousand.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.620]   That's not math was expensive.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.620]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   The Lisa was a five megahertz processor.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.420]   The dual floppy disk drives those twiggy drives.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.460]   They had a little bit of a design flaw.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.700]   The opening for the floppy was right where you put your thumb when you pulled it out.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.140]   Maybe somebody should have thought of that.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.020]   So that proves, you know, Apple hasn't always been perfect.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:00.620]   But it was the first based on the Xerox star interface, the windowed GUI with icons, pull
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.860]   them menus.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:06.140]   It was ten months later that Microsoft did Windows.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   So it was the first.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.140]   Right.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.140]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.580]   It also shows like Apple One to Apple Two, Lisa to Mac.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.700]   Apple often has not a really great product before they nail it with the next thing.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.860]   Well, that's true of every company, right?
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.020]   Your first edition might be...
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.020]   Look at Windows 8.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.020]   They might have a little...
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.020]   It's gonna be great.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:32.740]   But it also shows something even better about Apple that they are completely willing to
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.380]   torpedo one of their own successful products if they really think that this is where we
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.340]   need to be in the next five years.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.500]   But remember all the stuff that was...
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.020]   All the complaints about the Macintosh were absolutely spot on, that there was no software
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.020]   for it.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.500]   It was incompatible with Apple software.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:53.020]   It was compatible with DOS software that the Apple Two E, it was the...
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.380]   At least a hundred pound gorilla, which can still get amazing upper body strength and
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.380]   teeth.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.820]   So don't turn your back on a hundred pound gorilla, by any means.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.620]   It was just a monster, monster hit, monster seller.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.740]   The fact that they would come out with something that would in some ways challenge it for
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.900]   supremacy and eventually take sales away from it.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:17.420]   It became impossible to improve upon the Apple Two E partly because it's such a bad job
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:23.060]   with the Apple Three, but also partly because of the Macintosh was definitely the sexy computer
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:29.500]   you wanted to have next as opposed to a new iteration of a multi-slot text-based computer.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:35.140]   So remember if you read Steve's The Steve Jobs Biography by Walter Isaacson, he talks
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:40.780]   about the Lisa and really the schism that developed at Apple because Steve felt the Lisa
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.140]   was too expensive.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.060]   He really wanted to make a less expensive.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   And he was right.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:50.860]   And he was essentially forced out by the board because he developed the Mac and really created
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.620]   a schism within Apple and the board eventually forced him out and said, "John Scullough,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.820]   you run this company."
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.180]   The Lisa was the beginning of the end for Steve Jobs because he didn't believe in it.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.500]   He didn't want him to make a Lisa.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.940]   And basically the Mac cut it off, right?
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.620]   The Mac cut it off at the knees.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.620]   Right.
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.020]   Sort of like the iPhone and the iPod.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.660]   And now in hindsight the iPod is diminishing and the iPhone is rising.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.620]   Apple's one of the few companies that doesn't mistake their products for their business.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.180]   And it's really tempting to think if you make A, that's the business, but there's usually
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.180]   something behind it.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.420]   And Apple's been fairly good at understanding that they don't make Apple or they don't make
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.380]   Macs or they don't make iPods.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.860]   They make these devices that let us do things.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.980]   And there's new incarnations of those just as one is starting to fall down again.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.900]   So Lisa and the Apple 2E, happy birthday this week.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.620]   It's kind of amazing to think that's been 30 years, 1983.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.100]   Makes me feel old.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.100]   Me too.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.100]   Wow.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.220]   Let's see.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.420]   So you did ask a question, Andy, which at the very beginning of the show, which we haven't
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.380]   answered yet, which is what would you see in the quarterly results announced tomorrow
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:04.780]   by Apple that would indicate, I'll restate a little bit, either on the positive or the
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:10.660]   negative, you know, will give you some indication of whether there is, it is doomed or if there's
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660]   a great future.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.220]   Well, yeah, I mean, a lot, it's a good question in any way, you phrase it.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:20.940]   Mostly, mostly I was saying that I was trying to sort of underscore like the disconnection
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:26.540]   there should be between financial results and the products that they make and the services
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.540]   that they make.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.740]   Sometimes I think that the things that kind of annoy me frustrate me, disappoint me about
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:37.060]   so much of the conversation these days is that any conversation about how good an Apple
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.340]   competitor is is yes, but look how much look how much Apple is growing versus this competitor's
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:49.140]   company's growing or gee, you know, Apple's Apple seems to the iPhone 5 sales immediately
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:54.540]   after its launch are not as fast as sales of the iPhone 4S was the previous year.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.460]   It's like, let's get down to the basic point, is it a successful company?
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.460]   Yes.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.980]   So successful, how they can continue to do whatever they want to do?
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.980]   Yes.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:06.500]   Does the fact that the stock price is going down or the fact they might have sold fewer
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.340]   units this quarter than the same quarter last year?
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.140]   Does that affect your enjoyment of your Apple device?
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.140]   No, it doesn't.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.140]   Okay.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.140]   Conversation over.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.940]   Now let's talk about what different Mac based note taking apps we all like.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.740]   You know,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:28.020]   Apple has apparently pulled 500 PX apps from the market.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.220]   I guess the assumption is that the 500 PX, which is a flicker like site, a really good
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:40.260]   one, a lot of pros use are apparently too easy to search for nude photos.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.260]   Who knew?
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.980]   Sorry.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.260]   So Apple has pulled its mobile apps from the app store.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:56.740]   You know, there's this thing called the worldwide web and you open a Safari, you can go to pretty
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.500]   much anything the most hardcore porn you want.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.500]   So that's it.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.900]   They're going to pull Safari.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.300]   You oughta pull Safari, Apple.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.260]   Apple reviewer told the company the update couldn't be approved because it allowed users
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.700]   to search for nude photos.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:18.380]   Actually it actually 500 PX had made a little harder to do so.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.780]   You had to, safe search was the default.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.780]   You had to go in and turn it off.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:29.140]   I got to tell you, on Tumblr, it's almost hard not to see nude photos, whether you search
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.660]   or not.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.660]   That was it?
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.220]   Was it an issue where it allows that kind of search or was it simply an issue where
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.260]   it was mislabeled inside the app store?
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:46.140]   Because I was looking at the warnings for Grand Theft Auto Vice City and it's in the
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:51.780]   app store, even though it has warnings of mild to excessive violence, mild to excessive
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.460]   sexual content, mild to excessive drug use.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.100]   Is it labeling?
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.340]   If they resubmitted it and simply made sure that there was the appropriate labels, the
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.660]   appropriate warnings before someone can download it and they could just simply resubmit it
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:09.700]   or was it just simply, sorry, we don't like the lovely gallery effect you have on your,
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:15.100]   you know, I was about to, you know, on your newt picks.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.300]   I know it's interesting because I know you say it's artfully, artful nude-y picks, but
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.740]   there's still, you know, one of those being done with one of those.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.740]   We can't have that.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.740]   The folks at 500px are furious.
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.140]   They say the app was in the store for 16 months.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:33.140]   I didn't have any attention to it with these new anti-neut dirty measures.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.620]   You know, if you launch one password, it's got a browser built in.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.340]   So it has to tell you that it's an adult application that could act.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.620]   I know that always bugs the hell out of me.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:45.420]   And like I said, it could be that they didn't tick that box for that content or it could
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.100]   just be that once again, we have the Will Ferrell-like character in the App Store who
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:54.540]   approves tethering apps and disapproves apps that have been there for months.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:00.100]   I think it just really got to wonder if this hurts Apple or not.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:07.580]   I mean, it is, does Apple gain sales by doing this?
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.980]   Do they somehow reassure parents?
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:15.140]   Oh, well, they're blocking newty apps, so I think we should buy Johnny on an iPhone.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.460]   Well, I think that there is a-- what is the game to Apple to do this?
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.900]   Oh, and I don't know why.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.740]   I mean, especially if you have to deactivate it on the web, I don't have 500px, so I don't
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.740]   know.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.820]   But I think that if you have to actually turn the safe sort of off, the only question I
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.740]   have is whether the safe sort of was really working.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.500]   I mean, I know that as a parent--
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.860]   I think you might be just labeling.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.340]   It might just be-- there's adult potential adult content.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.340]   Yeah, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:41.700]   And the issue is, is it as a-- I have to be careful what kind of apps-- like one of the
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:46.540]   big problems that we had with-- because my three and five-year-old run around with iPads
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.540]   all the time.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.460]   Does Apple do that for Safari?
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.460]   No.
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.220]   Does Apple, before you launch Safari, say, hey, by the way, you could go to adult sites
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.220]   on this browser?
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.220]   Oh, no.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.220]   No.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.220]   Well, and--
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.820]   Why-- what's the double standard here?
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.860]   The phone inherently can go to porn.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.860]   Thanks to an app, Apple put on there.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.260]   Including searching 500px for nudes in the app.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.660]   I don't understand the double standard.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.860]   I think for a certain segment of the population, I think that this is probably a plus.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.860]   [LAUGHS]
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.740]   You know, they're going to be more-- you know, knowing that there's a controlled environment,
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:24.860]   I mean, it's one of those things that-- I don't think that-- I don't quite understand
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.260]   this decision.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:31.380]   But being able to have, as a parent, being able to have solid control over what's actually
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.340]   happening, you know, exactly what my kids are-- you know, it's mostly-- what we mostly
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.820]   have is there's a back end to, like, YouTube from Angry Birds.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.580]   And so what my kids do is they watch the Angry Birds videos.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.060]   They watch the Angry Birds videos, then they watch YouTube, and then there's--
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.020]   Does my phone have 20 minutes to live?
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.380]   --with an app to be limited because you let your kids use your phone?
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.380]   No, no, no.
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.220]   I'm just saying that Apple is--
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.700]   Apple is developing a market, and they're looking for a certain clientele.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.900]   And that clientele-- you know, part of that clientele is--
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:57.900]   What?
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.900]   --four-year-olds?
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.900]   Schools, parents.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:05.180]   Yeah, but I cannot now use the 500px app, even though I'm an adult.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.100]   This sounds like one of those dumb things where someone in Apple higher up on the review committee
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   or the executive committee looks at it and goes, "Oh, you did what?"
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.460]   And we had to put up with what?
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.260]   Just put that app back in, you know, a Uron's suspension firm.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.260]   No, I'm not sure.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:23.340]   Here's another one this is-- Fensher Beat writes about this, Jeffrey Grubb in the Apple
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.060]   Guidelines.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:30.300]   We view apps differently than books or songs, which we do not curate.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.940]   If you want to criticize a religion, write a book.
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:41.460]   If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song or create a medical app.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.980]   It can get complicated, but we have decided not to allow certain kinds of content in the
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.980]   app store.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.180]   This is Steve Jobs' legacy.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:52.420]   Remember, Steve was like proud of the fact that you couldn't get porn on the iPhone even
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.140]   though you obviously can.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.300]   Androids a porn phone?
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.100]   Yeah, he said, "Andro's a porn porn phone."
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.100]   Yes.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.780]   I don't know how this hippie guy, Steve Jobs got to be such a prude.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.500]   Thank God your picture's pixelated, Andy.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.940]   That's all I can say.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.580]   This 500px app is super, super hot.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.580]   Hot.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.580]   Oh my God.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.940]   Actually, I should actually check to make sure.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.940]   Okay, good.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.940]   There is no nudity in the--
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:21.020]   No, and by default-- and this has always been at 500px because there are a lot of
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.300]   news artistic, by the way, not pornographic.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.220]   Artistic news on 500px is a photographer's site.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.380]   By default, they've always blocked those.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.380]   Safe searches on.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.380]   Now there's a Flickr app.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.700]   You could do exactly the same thing on Flickr, by the way.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.820]   Tons of Wikipedia apps.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.020]   It seems like such a--
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.660]   Yeah, well, if you search-- if you write a book if you're doing a sex one, just do a
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.580]   search in the app store for CommaSutra.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.580]   Yeah, there's not--
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.580]   It's not like you know it.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.580]   It's not like you know it.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.580]   It's not like you know it.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.580]   It's not like you know it.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.580]   It's not like you know it.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.580]   But also, yeah, it's not a medical app.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:58.980]   It's a city, which is just a really-- it's a fun game, but you know it's a violent game.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.980]   It's not for kids.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.580]   People are doing extremely extreme things.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:08.100]   And it really-- it doesn't speak well of Apple that if they're not willing to allow a game
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.900]   that has a purpose-- excuse me, that the people who create the game feel as though there's
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   an educational purpose to it, and that's not allowed.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.620]   But if you want to shoot a hooker in the face and steal her car, perfectly finds long
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.780]   of their points involved.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.780]   Right.
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:27.220]   But I think back to the few years ago when someone released a brilliant game that essentially
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.820]   was a first person shooter that put you in Oswald's sniper's nest in "Daily Plaza."
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.940]   And it got a lot of like really negative attention because people thought that, oh, well, you're
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.900]   teaching kids to have fun shooting the president.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.100]   No, because the physics were actually quite accurate, the views from the sniper's nest
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.420]   are-- were absolutely wonderful.
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.500]   And if there's any way that you can start to bite into the people's suspicion that the
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.820]   president of the lone gunman theory, fine, here's a gun that has all the performance
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.100]   characteristics of the gun that Oswald used.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.900]   Here is a accurate model of the physics.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.540]   Here's an accurate model of the place.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.620]   Here is the car modeled accurately on the accurate train going exactly as fast as the
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.260]   broad-care was going, see if you can do it.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.620]   And within one day, people were saying, you know, not only was I able to duplicate Oswald's
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.180]   shooting, I was able to kill other people in the car and do it faster.
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:19.200]   So it's there are ways that you can use games to educate in ways that are-- by the same
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.580]   coin to manipulate people in ways that you can't do with a book or piece of music.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.180]   And if Apple is saying that we're not interested in publishing apps that have that kind of
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:32.340]   controversial potentially role, I think that doesn't speak well to them.
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:37.180]   I understand what they want to do there because it's not as though they want to-- the goal
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.380]   is we want to limit people's speech.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.780]   It's that they want to limit the amount of hassle they have to go-- the company has to
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.220]   go through in order to have a functioning app store.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.820]   And if they feel as though if it means that we occasionally have to not approve an app
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.860]   that has that kind of religious content or political content, we would much rather take
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.540]   the small amount of crap we're going to get for that than the enormous amounts of crap
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.740]   we would get by having an app that from the-- from Reverend Phelps, for instance.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:08.020]   Well, but that's-- and that's the point is that once you start censoring things, it is
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.540]   a mire.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.260]   Don't even get involved.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.580]   Oh, I mean, it's-- we come from an era of open computing.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:21.780]   If this had happened on a compute platform, oh, you can't buy that app for your Mac, it
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.620]   would be offensive in the highest degree.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620]   Right.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:28.980]   There isn't-- and what makes the phone so different?
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.500]   There's-- the one thing though is that this is not an outside body telling Apple they can't
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.500]   have the app.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.820]   This is Apple exercising editorial discretion.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:41.300]   The same way like NBC won't air my basement sitcom where the New York Times won't publish
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:45.100]   my diet tribe, they're electing not to have this sold in their store.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.140]   So it's a little bit different than when people often think--
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:52.660]   No, it would be more like Sony saying you can't watch porn on our television.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.660]   If it was--
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   That's what it would be like.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.020]   Because they're making the hardware.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.220]   They're not telling us if they said you can use somebody else's store, then that's fine.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:02.220]   That's not-- that's not the same thing.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.500]   That would be-- that similarity would be OK if they had-- if all the video players that
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.340]   were on the-- that were built into the thing said that we will not allow you to play any
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:15.980]   unrated content or a content that's rated above this level, we are not going to allow
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.380]   that to happen on our device.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.380]   That's what it's like.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.380]   I think it's more--
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.140]   I think the danger is really more like what's happened to Walmart where Walmart gets into
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:26.500]   trouble in saying that we will not carry this movie, we will not carry this book, we
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:31.380]   will not carry this game because we-- it's not family Walmart values--
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.380]   But the difference is you can only buy--
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   The big difference is that you can only buy--
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.460]   But the difference is you can only buy apps from Apple.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.940]   It means that Walmart gets this reputation as no, this is not a place we actually can
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.780]   buy things you want.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:51.860]   It's a place with a corporate agenda and a political agenda in a sense and a society agenda.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.180]   It's not an open marketplace.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.860]   And that's the-- that's the attitude that they're saddled with, the public opinion they're
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.820]   saddled with, the danger to Apple.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:02.260]   They're certainly free to pursue whatever agenda they want to pursue.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:08.020]   But the danger is that people will not associate the iTunes content store with an open marketplace
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.700]   where you can get anything you want.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.700]   And that's--
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.820]   But in a place where the Sony store and the Google Play store and the Amazon stores are
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.620]   more Wild West, I hope that doesn't bite them in the butt sometime.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:20.620]   It did.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.180]   And I think that I think the other-- there's a liability issue I think also for Apple is
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:28.700]   once you start making the censorship decisions, it also makes you possibly liable for the
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.100]   decisions you don't make.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:35.380]   So once-- if someone uses your-- an app on the app store to do something illegal or to
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.020]   do other things that are there, because you were censoring, you know, once you start stepping
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:43.660]   into it, the real challenge you get into after that is that you could get yourself into a
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.500]   position where you said, well, if you're cens-- if you're actually taking an active role
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.820]   here and then something happened, why didn't you take action there?
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:50.820]   So it does--
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.020]   It's a-- it's a-- it's a foolish--
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.020]   It's a carpet.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.020]   You know, and it's--
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.380]   I think Jobs was on stage saying we have two platforms.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.900]   We have the app store, which we curate, and we have web apps via Safari, which they use
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.020]   web.app and they use UI web-- and stuff like that to-- and you can show anything you want
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:10.820]   in there, which is why Playboy made the HTML5 app that works great on the iPad, but they
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.620]   couldn't put that into the store.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:15.220]   So they've clearly divided their two tracks.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.760]   But again, I don't think this is-- I mean, because it's nudity involved, it hits the
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.260]   censorship button and the editorial button hard.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:25.260]   But I think this is just one of the dumb things that happened in the app store and that
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.260]   gets reversed in fairly short order.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.980]   If this is the whole story, I mean, you know, a lot of times when Apple does this, there's
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.620]   one that's complaints about it, we haven't seen all the details.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.180]   So-- and the thing is, is that Apple is definitely playing for a certain market and the folks
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:43.820]   that are-- you know, that a lot of people who have iPads and iPhones and so on and so
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.820]   forth don't really care.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.340]   I mean, I think that's the issue is that they do care--
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.340]   They do care that--
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.340]   They're going to start caring, I think.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.340]   No, I don't think so.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.180]   I think 80% of the population that has an iPad-- iPhone won't care.
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.620]   And I think that that's the issue, that's what Apple-- they do care, they will care if
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.860]   their kids are running around with nudity on their phone much less than they care about
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:06.500]   whether an app that they've never heard of is banned is not going to mean anything to
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.500]   them.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.900]   And I think that we in the tech industry oftentimes think about, you know, that it needs
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.740]   to be all free and open and everything else.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.660]   And I get sensitive about that.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:20.260]   But I also, when I go back home and talk to my parents, they're just still figuring out
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.500]   how to put apps on their phone.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.060]   I mean, so the thing is that my wife has like two pages of apps.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.340]   So she's not going to care.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.580]   What she does get mad about is every time they're swearing coming out of the iPad from
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.580]   YouTube.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.060]   So what I get all the time is you need to make that go away.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.060]   You need to make that stop.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.140]   I hear that over and over and over again.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.100]   So I have to build all these little things and to make sure my kids don't get to YouTube
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.620]   because my wife complains about it.
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.260]   So the thing is there are a lot of people who are buying those, whether they're schools
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.980]   or parents or whatever.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:51.220]   And Apple's definitely more interested in that market than they are interested in folks
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.100]   that want absolute freedom.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.940]   The one thing that is dangerous, or maybe a little bit dangerous, is that developers
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.500]   who might make the next great app might become risk adverse.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.020]   There's a lot of things in the App Store beyond censorship.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:08.140]   The entire business model of the App Store that makes creating risky, innovative apps
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.100]   less likely or less financially rewarding on the App Store.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.340]   And if enough of those people decide to make great apps on other platforms and you start
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:19.380]   getting franchise level killer apps that aren't on the iPhone or at least aren't first on
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.380]   the iPhone.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:24.060]   Then it becomes an Apple problem where the Wall Street Journal is writing about it.
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.540]   Then it's an Apple problem.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.980]   Until now it's someone who liked the 500 PX app.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:34.540]   And you have to prove that the folks that care about that freedom are willing to pay
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:38.180]   for those apps, which I think has not been proven yet.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:42.020]   That's a big problem for Android right now.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.780]   You talk to most developers.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.940]   It hasn't paid enough to recently.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   It's now picking up.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.300]   It's definitely changing as this starts to build up.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.420]   But that's the challenge that they all have in the marketplaces.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.940]   We're going to take a break.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.420]   Come back with rumors.
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   What is Apple's roadmap for 2013?
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.900]   MacRumors says they know.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   I trust Renee Richie.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.900]   He's the rumor king.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.900]   We'll find out.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.900]   They're calling an analyst.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.900]   We can play in the analyst.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.900]   It's some dumb analyst.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.780]   Oh, I hate the analysts.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.220]   It's not Gene Munster is it?
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.660]   No, it's actually one of the better analysts.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   Okay.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.660]   Well, it's worth hearing.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.220]   Basically, we'll all, until tomorrow all we got is rumors anyway.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.860]   At least he's a better analyst because he's pulling it out of his ear instead of his book.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.980]   Munster said TV in remote control again.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.340]   We know where Munster stands.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.820]   If you've got an iPhone and you want to get the newest, if you've got an iPad 3 and you
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.860]   want to get an iPad 4, if you have a Evan for Fend, an older Blackberry rim and you want
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.000]   to get a newer phone, I've got a place you can sell your stuff for a great price and
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.500]   do it easily and quickly it's gazelle.com.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.020]   Get your stuff moving here.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:54.900]   Let's say you got a 4S and you're saying, I would love to get this iPhone 5.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.900]   Let's get an offer here.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   It's in good condition.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   240 bucks.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.180]   That's going to buy me the iPhone 5 right there.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.180]   That's awesome.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.100]   Nice deal.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:09.980]   If you've got a, you know, I know a lot of people, myself included, it wasn't until I
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.220]   started playing that Simpsons game that I realized the iPad 3 is a little slow for the
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.220]   retina display.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.220]   Yes.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.620]   It's Homer, Marge, you know, Chief Wigam.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.700]   They're all wandering around the same time.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.820]   It's a little slow.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:27.580]   So I'm thinking I'm going to take that iPad 3 third generation AT&T 64 gigabytes.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580]   Just check and see.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.380]   It's a good shape.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.660]   365 bucks.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.820]   Now I can buy an iPad 4 from practically nothing.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.580]   This is the kind of, this is the kind of great deal we're talking about.
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.300]   And what's good is these prices are good for 30 days.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.660]   So if you think Apple's going to make an announcement next, you know, week, don't worry
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.660]   about it.
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.660]   Get the quote now.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.460]   The price is not going up.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.460]   It's going down on everything.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.380]   So get the quote now and you have 30 days to take advantage of it.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.140]   Once you get all your stuff together, press the button.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:00.100]   Gazelle sends you a shipping container and pays the postage on anything worth more than
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.300]   a buck.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.620]   So it's postage free.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:06.780]   You just throw it all in there, send it to Gazelle and then they send you a check or if
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.540]   you're in a hurry, a PayPal credit, you can even get an Amazon gift card with an additional
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.820]   5% on top of it.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.580]   I guess that they're rebating the affiliate fee or something like that.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.580]   But anyway, it's a great deal.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.580]   Go for it.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.740]   If you like Amazon, I buy everything on Amazon.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.140]   That's the way to go.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:25.140]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.220]   Keep it moving.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.820]   They have, I have to have the stat here.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.340]   Let me just check.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:40.180]   They have sent so far $50 million to over a half a million customers since they started.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.540]   Gazelle, oh, by the way, they wipe your data too.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.540]   They have data professionals.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:44.540]   They wipe the data.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.740]   You don't have to worry about that.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.740]   Gazelle.com.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.740]   You're going to love it.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.060]   Give it a try today.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:59.660]   So from the Apple 2013 product roadmap from Ming Chi Quo, who is an analyst at KGI Securities
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:07.060]   and MacRumors agrees with you, Renee Ritchie, that Ming Chi has a very good track record
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.780]   in predicting Apple's products.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.780]   Here's what they say.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.220]   This is the 2013 product and ship roadmap.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.540]   The first thing, an Apple TV refresh in the first quarter, like in the next month or so.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.380]   Second quarter, a new MacBook Air.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.340]   We're due, aren't we?
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.980]   Should be a Retina display?
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.980]   What do you think?
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   That sounds great.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.980]   I love that.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:28.980]   Not yet.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.140]   No, because you need a high-end sub-video graphics system.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.660]   Well, it's the same problem as the iPad Mini is that Retina demands more size, more battery,
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:39.140]   more LED, and fitting that into a pet, until you have breakthroughs in LED.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.380]   A lot of the stuff that analysts predict is based on components and technologies that
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.380]   are available.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.180]   Like Apple needs the next Qualcomm chip to do LTE, so you have a fairly good idea when
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.980]   they won't do it before and when they might do it.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.780]   The same thing for the iPad Mini Retina and the MacBook Air Retina is they need a panel,
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:59.900]   LED, and a battery that will let them keep that form factor and power that display at
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.900]   the same time.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.460]   Like you mentioned, Leo, the graphics chip as well.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.100]   I don't have to say I would pay the same amount of money for my Retina if it wasn't
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:07.100]   Retina.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.100]   In fact, and I'd still buy it.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.100]   I hate the Retina.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.100]   You don't like the Retina.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:16.460]   The amount of processing power that we give up in the graphics errors and all the little
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.940]   weird tearing that I get.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.940]   Really?
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.900]   So if you open up Photoshop or Omni-Graphall and you start playing on other things, you'll
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:23.900]   start seeing tearing.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.900]   You'll see all kinds of other things.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   Thank you, Paul.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.980]   And it's the weird thing like you capture an image and suddenly it's a lot bigger than
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.420]   what you expected.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.260]   And then this whole like when you hook another monitor outside of it and you now have to
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.260]   go to scale.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:38.260]   That's all I just I really want my old my old interface.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.300]   You are in love with the MacBook Pro Retina.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.340]   No, I love the laptop.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.340]   Everything about it.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.580]   Everything about it except for the screen.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.780]   So the the two thunderbolts, the HDMI out the I wish I had one more USB screen.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.740]   Do you think they push the Retina too soon since they're not going to be able to put
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.740]   it up and anything else?
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.740]   Absolutely.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740]   Absolutely.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.540]   It's like the the very first MacBook Air that wasn't a great machine and the real MacBook
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.540]   Air came later.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:01.100]   This is like the first step towards a this is the Apple or the Lisa of the Retina.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.460]   I really wish they'd really wish they'd they'd just I'm feeling bad.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.460]   I love my Retina.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.620]   If you're not pushing it really hard, I think it's fine.
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.020]   I think that the big issue is is that if you if you really need performance out of that
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:15.220]   laptop and that laptop is so powerful and it's got so many things going for it.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.580]   I just wish they'd build a version that was non Retina and a version that was Retina.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.900]   So the people actually needed performance out of it.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.220]   They just didn't need pretty text but actually in performance out of it could actually get
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.220]   it.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.140]   Well, Ming Chico says there will be a new design Retina MacBook Pro in the third quarter right
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:34.740]   about the same time Apple announces two new iPhones.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:42.140]   They're thinking June of July for yeah, what we thought an iPhone 5s and an iPhone 5 revamped.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:46.340]   Is this the math that they're talking about?
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.460]   So here's what they're saying.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.860]   The iPhone 5s will be an a seven system on a chip for better performance.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:06:02.500]   They will have a fingerprint sensor, a faster camera f2.0 aperture, smarter LED flash and
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:08.580]   then they will do an iPhone 5 repackaged into a slightly thicker plastic enclosure in six
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   colors.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580]   Where do they get this?
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580]   This must be from the suppliers right?
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.580]   I mean, there's no reason you couldn't pull this out of your butt.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:19.180]   No, well, the less expensive iPhone is something that my understanding is Apple's been working
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.340]   on for years and they've had prototypes for it but they chose instead to lower the cost
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.980]   of other iPhones and make those available.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.940]   Apple works on tons of stuff in the labs, whether they ever go to market on it.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:35.220]   And if there comes a point where they decide that a low end colorful iPhone will increase
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.180]   their addressable market and make them more money and will still be a great product because
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:44.140]   they'll never do a net book of iPhones and then they'll release it.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   Especially in the chatroom, EmpowerMac is asking about an IGZO display, Indium-Galium-Zinc
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.140]   Oxide.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.740]   That helps with new LEDs that help.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:55.740]   We've seen them in TVs.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.300]   They look gorgeous on the show floor at CES.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:04.700]   Supposedly, according to Digitimes, Apple has been in discussion with Sharp over these
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.300]   IGZO panels for 2013.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.500]   If they can get the yield rates and the pricing that they need.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.940]   You give us an ethernet port.
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:19.500]   Stop and pre-notch on a half-ven.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.940]   And not gonna half-ven.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:30.700]   After putting down Andy's issues about the ethernet port, probably the number one thing
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:35.220]   that I run into is showing up at a location to test a location.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.220]   But you're just plugging the thunderbolt?
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.220]   I don't have a little...
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.220]   Because it's not built in.
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.220]   You know, you get...
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.220]   Yeah, you forget it.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.220]   Someone borrowed it.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.580]   And this is really true.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:49.340]   You cannot go out into the world with a MacBook without the little package of connectors.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.780]   There is about eight of them.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.780]   You gotta have that.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.580]   Because, look it, I have just the same bag.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.060]   I have exactly the same bag.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.740]   That's like how to glue everything into everything.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.260]   And now I also have lightnings in there of all kinds.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.380]   Yeah, no, I have these have lightening to HDMI and then a whole bunch of thunderbolts
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.020]   and all, you know, to...
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.620]   We've got a long way, baby.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.380]   The IgZO is a lower power.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:19.220]   So and it's improved touch sensitivity and it could be higher pixel density as well.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.620]   And the glass edge is slimmer.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.020]   So the devices can be smaller.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:28.860]   All of these things are things you would like in your portable devices, iPhones, iPads.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.020]   So that's...
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.220]   Let's hope that rumor is accurate.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:37.780]   The iPad and the iPad Mini, Apple will update both lines during the third quarter.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.260]   That's June, July, August.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.260]   Sure.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.260]   It's September.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.340]   It's actually July, August, September.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:46.660]   With the iPad Mini gaining a retina display is the most notable change.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:51.220]   You also predict full size iPad will become considerably slimmer and lighter with those
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.580]   bezels that the Mini has.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.780]   Yeah, I'm really interested in the fingerprint scanner.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.540]   I am.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.820]   What I think though is I think what's more likely is...
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.340]   What's more useful is facial recognition.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.980]   They will a lot of work in that area.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.100]   Being able to just take my iPad and go like this and open up my...
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.100]   And open up my...
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.580]   You know, Android does that, but it's so bad.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.580]   It doesn't...
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.780]   It sort of does it sometimes.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   Windows 8 does it...
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.980]   You mean fingerprint or...
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:19.220]   Well, I've had fingerprint on laptops, but no, Android has the face recognition and juju
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.220]   bean.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.220]   You're only one Leo mask away from getting all his stuff?
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.220]   Yeah, it's just not.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.020]   In fact, they don't even say it's secure.
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.020]   Well, you know, it depends on what kind of camera they're using.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:33.220]   I mean, there is a lot of technology out there that's not just using the geometry.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:34.620]   It is actually using heat recognition.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.020]   So it depends on what kind of camera they put in the front of that as far as...
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020]   I mean, you can...
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.020]   I'd say...
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.420]   There's a lot of good technology in that area.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.500]   I think the bigger problem is that if you're not...
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.780]   There's not 100% of all situations are ones of which you can really conveniently go like
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.900]   this before you actually use phone.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.380]   No, but I think having that as an option for me to be able to hit something because
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.460]   it's just a type of code in it.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   Is that really the Apple way?
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.860]   I think the Apple way is to figure out what they think is the best way of doing something
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.540]   and make that as perfect as they can make it rather than saying, "We'll give you a
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540]   fingerprint."
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.540]   Well, but I think it's a Facebook...
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.540]   They say it's a Facebook...
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.540]   They'll make a picture.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:11.940]   Whether it's Android or iOS, I think biometric controls become very important as we move into
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.500]   digital IDs in the next decade is that it's not just going to be a code.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.780]   It has to be something that is...
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.500]   It may not be that something that you just open your phone.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.500]   I agree.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.900]   Biometrics is good if it works, but these devices are so stupid.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.900]   Well, they have to...
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.900]   This is the beginning.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   This is the beginning like this.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900]   I'm working on it.
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.900]   I have a back turn on.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.900]   They have face unlock.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.020]   They have face and voice unlock on Android.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.020]   Here's what it says.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.180]   "Look at your phone to unlock it.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.260]   Keep these things in mind.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:37.540]   Face unlock is less secure than a patterned pin or password.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.620]   Someone who looks similar to you could unlock your phone.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:42.580]   The data used to identify your face is kept private.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.340]   Should we set it up?
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.340]   Find an indoor spot, not too bright, not too dim.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.340]   Hold the phone at eye level.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.340]   Do not use it while driving.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.780]   Okay, starting up.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.100]   Here's my face.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.580]   My voice is my passport.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.820]   Authorize me.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.820]   Yes.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.540]   It's very good reference.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:59.540]   Don't move.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.340]   Steve at Total Loskey.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.780]   Wow.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.980]   You read it too, huh?
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.980]   Right.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:11.420]   Say the word or phrase used to use is your wake up command four times.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.860]   Mac break weekly sucks.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.860]   Mac break weekly sucks.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:17.260]   Now I've got to say that four times.
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.500]   Mac break weekly sucks.
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:19.500]   Mac break weekly sucks.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   I don't think it's going to work as well.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.300]   You've got to laugh.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.500]   Well, I think we know what our show title is going to have to be.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   Thank you very much for your award.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.900]   I absolutely agree with what you're saying.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.540]   I mean, I think that another way that if you want to think about what Apple, what you
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:42.140]   think Apple might be doing in the next four or five years, I'd always, what's, what point
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.780]   of what part of this is broken?
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.540]   What part of this that needs to be fixed?
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.260]   I think that verification is definitely one of those things.
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.540]   I don't think that this is something that this is something that is, especially this
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.540]   device is to get lost.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:56.020]   So if there's a way to, for instance, put in like a fingerprint scanner, literally on
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.260]   the edge of the device.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:00.420]   I'm sure that it cannot, it not only knows the rumor.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.420]   Exactly.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.740]   And I imagine not only does it know the pattern that you grip it with, but can also get some
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:09.340]   information about the, the identity from that, that is something that I think Apple would
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.900]   do that would actually tell people to say, maybe I should, maybe I should make my next
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   phone.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.700]   I mean, I think that, I think that if you're a government agency or you're, or you are
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:22.140]   a, a company that has some issue with security, it's, this isn't just to open up your phone
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.140]   every single time.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:27.340]   It's put a tap password in, give your voice, you know, recognition, put your thumb print
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.220]   in and look at the, and look at the phone.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.340]   It's not that any one of those is accurate.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:35.140]   It's that, and it's not like, and it's not the technology that would be used in this phone
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:39.460]   would be necessary right now, but imagine being able to vote for instance online because
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:42.260]   you, you were able to, because you were able to prove a long way to do that.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.740]   I bet you, I bet you, I bet you some states will start experimenting with that in the
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   next 10 years.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:50.380]   And you know, Apple would build a right into serious, I'll say, Alex, I can't point to you.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.180]   Can you please turn the phone into the left?
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.100]   Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   Why are you frowning, Alex?
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100]   You're using an iPhone.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.100]   Alex?
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.100]   Why are you naked?
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.100]   I'm not naked.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.100]   Logians.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.100]   I'm a good person.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:06.460]   Remember that real iPhone users are smiling all the time.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.460]   Right.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.860]   Smile all the time when you're using the phone, Alex.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   Please enter your top like sense of wonder to continue.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.380]   It's apparently the MIT technology review says that Apple does have a job listing for
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:22.460]   writers to enhance series witty personality.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.460]   That's awesome.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.220]   They bought that security company for who knows.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.220]   Yeah, they say.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.860]   I think Apple should just hire half the staff from the onion and then just, and just would
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.860]   be fun to work.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]   That would be awesome.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.860]   They want someone.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.620]   I saw that job listing.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.540]   I was so close to just saying, I know you're going to say that there, I can't take this
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.220]   job for a lot of reasons and you can't give me this job for a lot of reasons.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.780]   But let's at least walk through this process to see if maybe there is a way that I can
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:50.740]   take this job, but you can be so awesome to have Andy, right?
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:53.660]   Andy, you would, you would, you, you so should do that.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:59.620]   You should give up your high paying famous job and at least, at least, you know, moonlight
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.620]   for Apple writing for them.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.620]   That would be awesome.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:02.780]   You are made for it.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.860]   So if it came out a year from now that, yes, I did lie to everybody and I haven't worked
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:10.780]   writing for Siri for a past year, I think they would say, okay, Andy, that was naughty.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.540]   You should have told us, but we totally understand.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.420]   I think we should create a petition.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.020]   I think we should create a petition for Apple that we should just tell them they should
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.180]   hire Andy even part time to do this.
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.980]   You know, Andy and Akos should be contributing.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.300]   My book reference will know he did it.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.900]   Here's the listing.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.060]   They're looking for someone who combines a love for language, word play and conversation.
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.380]   That's Andy.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:36.500]   With a demonstrated experience in bringing creative content to life within an intense
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.060]   technical environment.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.060]   That's Andy.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.500]   You'll need experience in writing character driven dialogue.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500]   Andy.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.900]   A good vocabulary and ideally knowledge of what more than one language.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:47.900]   What's your second language?
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.900]   I make up words often times.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:56.700]   The goal of the hiring would be to quote evolve and enrich Siri.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.780]   Apple is focused on keeping Siri's personality.
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:02.020]   I just got the idea.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.740]   If there's a part of that for the resume, I'll have to make it like a dating video.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.220]   Well, Siri, I see from your profile that you like good conversation.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.020]   Listen, I talk a lot for a living and I read a lot comics, movies.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.260]   I have a lot of references.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.660]   Although I try not to be too annoying about making those pop culture references.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.060]   I try to listen as much as I talk.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.100]   I know that you tend to want to listen more than that, but I'll try not to be overbearing
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:29.300]   and anyway, so my idea is 441-4812.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:33.380]   You want to go for a long run?
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:40.620]   If you're like me, I like to walk outdoors with my phone by parks and in public public
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.620]   spaces.
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.740]   You want to feel alive again?
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.620]   I like to look for restaurants.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:48.300]   I like to ask about the weather all the time.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:54.900]   The interesting thing in this whole lineup of apples roadmap, again, admittedly, not
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:02.940]   from Apple, obviously, nothing at all about a Mac Pro.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.020]   He does expect a shift to the Haswell platform for the new iMac and the Mac mini and the
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.020]   MacBook Air.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:14.540]   That's the new Intel chip in the fourth quarter, but no Mac Pro.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.540]   You know, I had a caller.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.980]   I don't think they're going to do it.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:25.300]   On the weekend, who is a film editor, and he's having huge problems with the log and store
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.420]   on the old Final Cut.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.780]   It's apparently broken the studio.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:34.140]   He can't move to Final Cut Pro 10, the app store version, because it's missing things
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.140]   that he needs.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.420]   He like a lot of pros.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.980]   It's becoming more and more frustrated with Apple's approach to the pro market.
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:42.980]   I think they are.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:49.460]   What's interesting about it is that Final Cut 10 was actually a boom for Apple, Adobe,
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.460]   and Avid.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:54.940]   There's very few things that you could do that everybody wins.
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.580]   What happened was that with Final Cut 10, they massively expanded their market.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:03.300]   They made more money than they've made in a long time on Final Cut.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.180]   It was a huge boom for them.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:08.700]   It was also a boom for Adobe, who saw a lot of people going over to Premiere, and it was
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.380]   a huge boom for Avid, who saw mostly a lot of people coming back to Avid that had gone
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.940]   over to Final Cut.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.980]   All of them made money out of the deal.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:21.860]   It's quite a unique anomaly in a business decision that all the competitors actually
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.940]   benefited from Apple making that change.
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.380]   I don't think Apple really is worried about.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.700]   The market to do high-end film or high-end commercials or a lot of those pieces is not
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:38.940]   nearly the size of the e-learning or corporate markets or other markets that are there.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.980]   I think that Apple is writing going down the direction.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:46.100]   It's very frustrating for a lot of people who depended on them in that area.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.100]   I don't think they're going back.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.260]   I think that you just have to decide what part of the market you're in and make a decision
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.980]   about whether ... I have one of my companies, works mostly on Premiere.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.180]   We do some stuff with Avid, and then we do most of our stuff with Final Cut 10.
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.260]   That's our ... from Pixelcores, we're using a little bit of all of that stuff.
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:09.620]   I don't think Apple's going to go back.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.180]   I don't have any assumption that they're going to do that.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.380]   I don't think we're going to see a Mac Pro.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:17.900]   I think ... it's more likely that Apple will stop.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:24.580]   I think the real thing that Apple should be thinking about as opposed to a Mac Pro is to
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:33.100]   deactivate looking for the chip on the Mac and just let OS 10 be like work on Intel.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.100]   It's the Intel platform.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.660]   For $30, you can put it on a PC.
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:42.980]   I think as the market, as Apple's Mac market becomes less of their business, it becomes
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:49.340]   easier for them rather than continuing to build all those machines is simply unleash
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:53.940]   their operating system on the other competitors because there's a lot of people and a lot
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:58.860]   of companies that for $30 a head without a whole lot of overhead would definitely change
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.340]   to a Mac, but want to use PC hardware.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:07.140]   There's a lot of pro users who would love to be able to have really big beefy systems
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.540]   with OS 10 on it.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.940]   I think that that is the ... Apple is more likely to do that in my opinion.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:15.900]   I know that doesn't sound like they would do it, but they're more likely to do that than
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.420]   release a Mac Pro at this point, I think.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.140]   I think I put a link to OpenBSD, I think, on their website.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.140]   I've got a far standpoint.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.660]   No, but I don't think they want OS Darwin.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:27.340]   I don't think they want OS ... I think ... and I'm not saying they should open source ... I
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.340]   used to say this.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:34.380]   I don't think they should open source OS 10, but I think that making it ... that's how
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:38.820]   people are doing ... crack it is they just stop looking for the chip.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.860]   If Apple just stopped doing that, that by itself, it doesn't mean that they're open
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.860]   source in.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.380]   It doesn't mean that they're supporting the hardware.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:48.660]   It just means that they are making it available to a lot of other people with hardware because
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:52.980]   people who buy Macs, in my opinion, buy them for the hardware.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.500]   The hardware that ... when I buy an iMac, a 27-inch iMac, for the price, I feel like
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:04.380]   I'm getting the highest performance I'm going to get in the package, the size, the quality,
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:08.380]   everything else, the look, everything that I'm getting there is going ... I don't think
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.940]   I'm going to find a PC that's going to do the same thing.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:14.780]   I don't think Apple competes from a hardware perspective anymore on the hardware.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.740]   They have a small part of their business.
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:21.860]   They didn't do a ... they didn't allow video recording on the iPhone 3G because it was
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.860]   a few frames lower than what they would expect.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:27.340]   I think that if they released the operating system ... I mean, there'd be no drivers
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.340]   that support people.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.340]   We haven't read their own stuff.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:33.020]   It would create in their minds an experience that they don't want to see it without the
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.020]   brand.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.020]   Yeah, but I think they're not moving that way.
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.020]   They're moving the exact opposite.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.540]   But I guess what I would say is that they keep on making their hardware.
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:43.420]   They could literally just not look for that one chip, not promote it, not support it,
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.420]   not say that it's a good idea.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.580]   I haven't seen a lot of prosecutions of Hackintosh.
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.340]   They're not prosecuting Hackintosh, but I'm saying they do Hackintosh.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.340]   But I'm just saying ...
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.340]   You can do one now.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.500]   I just think that it would be ... it would expand a lot faster from the ...
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.700]   It's not moving towards less control.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:57.700]   It's pretty apparent.
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:01.260]   Well, I just think that the ... I think OS X from their perspective is not part of their
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.260]   future.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:05.540]   I don't mean to say it that way, but I mean, it's ... I do mean to say it that way.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:10.400]   I mean, it is ... it is not ... that's not the ... some amalgamation of iOS and OS X is
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.260]   somewhere in the distant future.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.980]   And I think that the current operating system at some point in time becomes something they
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.660]   can ... they can make it more available.
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.580]   I think it's really interesting that maybe this is just the way the numbers happen to
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.580]   follow.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:29.620]   But so if they continue with their one updated year release schedule, we'll be at 10.9 and
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.260]   2013.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:36.740]   Something about the psychology of large round numbers says that 11.0 might be someplace
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:39.780]   where they're targeting the big change.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:44.780]   If they truly are committed to their historical problem of we're okay with inconveniencing
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:49.980]   a great number of people like Final Cut 10 users, like Apple II-E users, like even ...
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:57.860]   like even exact Apple Maps users, even Mac users who wanted a $500 Macintosh, we're willing
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.580]   to go in our own direction and make something incompatible.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:05.420]   You would think that ... I'm sorry, I should tamp that down and say it's tempting to think
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:10.540]   that 11.0 is going to be something rather radical and rather exceptional.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.700]   A couple of quick stories before we wrap it up.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.100]   The guy who ... Go ahead.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.700]   Before we move on, I just wanted to mention it's interesting because we don't have a clear
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:24.420]   sense of Apple's March event because it's usually iPads and they just put out a new iPad
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:30.060]   and new iPad Mini and Min Chi has the Apple TV refresh in there.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.060]   That's all, though.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.860]   Which is interesting because it's already 1080p.
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:35.820]   There's not going to be a 4K Apple TV.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.660]   There's no sign that they've gotten any deals in place with Hollywood to offer more functionality
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:40.820]   on an Apple TV.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:44.960]   So sitting there all by itself in that corner, it's either a press release or it's something
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.540]   more interesting that would warrant an event around it.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:53.540]   I think the two things that Apple TV could do without creating a TV is A, let the USB
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:23:00.260]   port that already exists in there, take a webcam so that you could do FaceTime and two
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.260]   is apps.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.100]   Actually, let people write apps to the Apple TV.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.260]   If it's not opening a whole app store that's the iOS app store, at least let people actually
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.980]   start creating apps rather than just be a consumer device.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.460]   I'm starting to think of the gaming platform and all kinds of other things.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.540]   That's an obvious thing to do.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.900]   And either Google nor Apple do that, and I started to think that there's a reason.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.580]   It's like Siri and that they want a channel strategy.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.820]   If you make a specific deal with a content partner and then you open up an SDK, anyone
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.460]   can make it and that destroys any value that that channel partnership has for you.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.460]   So they're probably going to keep...
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.460]   I think that there's...
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.180]   I think that there's also a big concern about it being too geeky.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.220]   So I think that that is...
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.820]   But I think that that is where you open it up or suddenly people are using the TV for
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.820]   other things.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:41.820]   I don't think so because smart TVs have apps.
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:42.980]   And no one uses them.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.980]   But they put them in there.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.540]   And that's an even more consumer-y product than Apple TV.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.540]   But I'm a Google TV.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.540]   I'm a little geeky.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:50.540]   I have apps on my...
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.060]   I don't even know how to get to them.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.100]   I just go to my Apple TV and then I go...
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:57.980]   If Apple started adding apps, if I could start buying iOS apps, I would use that a
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.780]   lot more than the goofy stuff that they put on my hands.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:04.140]   Well, I agree on one of apps to stay one.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:08.980]   I feel as though while all these companies are behind locked doors arguing about what
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:12.940]   the future is going to be, I think people are already moving forward.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.860]   I just spend a lot of getting...
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:19.260]   Upgrading my broadband here at the house involved a lot of looking into all the services that
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.060]   my provider offers and a lot of other offers.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.700]   And which gives me sort of an opportunity to think of all of the things that I have piped
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.020]   into my house and whether I really want them or not.
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.740]   And man, I probably was within five minutes of saying, "You know what?
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:34.980]   Why don't you just cancel my TV channels?"
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:39.420]   Because so much of what I do really isn't linked towards an actual cable box and actual
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.420]   broadcast.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.940]   It's possible they're trying to work towards locking down content that people don't care
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:44.940]   about anymore.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:45.940]   Right.
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.940]   And they should...
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.940]   I think that...
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:52.540]   I'm almost starting to think that the company that really integrates and gets what Internet
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:56.620]   TV should be all about is a company where you turn it on and hear our icons of all the
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.780]   different services you subscribe to or use.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.820]   And it doesn't assume that you want to watch television.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:02.820]   It might...
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:06.700]   Maybe your point of view of entry is going to be Netflix or the HBO Go app or whatever.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.500]   So I wish they'd stop arguing as they start.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.580]   Come up with that first semi awful thing.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:15.860]   I mean, Apple, you've done it before, you've released Maps that at least gets that product
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:16.860]   outfit out there.
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:17.860]   It gets the discussion going and...
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.460]   Oh, and I look at my next iteration out there.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:23.220]   I think one of the big things going for us with Apple losing some of its market share
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:27.420]   and getting pressed a little bit harder by its competitors is that Apple might need to
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.980]   get more aggressive.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.460]   You know, and actually do some stuff that's a little bit more out there.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.180]   Right now, I think sometimes they're dragging their feet.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.380]   It's not just their competitors.
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:39.540]   It's their competitors who used to be their service provider and their manufacturer.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:42.460]   So it puts them in a very difficult position.
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:47.460]   But right now, I did cancel my cable and I use the Canadian Network app, CTV Global,
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.780]   City TV Apps.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:51.260]   CTV app will airplay, but not over a regular airplay.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:55.620]   You have to do airplay mirroring and the City TV app won't do it because of contract deals.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:59.340]   And it creates a very fragmented experience.
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:03.020]   And I think if we can get movement on those things and you kind of circumvent the whole
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.900]   problem about the box is that your content is just where you are and you put it where
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:06.900]   you want it to be.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:11.060]   The people who want the traditional channel lineup, this is another problem.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.580]   They're starting to age out of the system.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.660]   When you get these people who are now, who never really knew TV that way, who are now
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:22.940]   close to being that generation that is now getting their own apartments, getting their
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.940]   real jobs, getting the job market with real degrees.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.380]   And then soon there'll be the people who are starting to buy the houses now.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:32.140]   My kids don't know.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.460]   They don't know what's on where.
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.900]   They don't know when it happened.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:38.780]   They don't even know what they don't know what they don't connect to networks anymore.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.780]   And they just can't do the shows that they're watching.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:41.780]   It's funny.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.500]   I'm old and I don't know what that's where you're either.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.900]   I rarely know it either.
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:49.460]   I mean, it's so I mean, I think that we're a little bit of a unique situation with the
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:50.460]   early adopters.
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:54.260]   But I think that there is that generation under 25 that is just totally disconnected
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.260]   from that.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.660]   We're going to take a break.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:59.460]   Come back with your picks of the week, gentlemen.
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.460]   Prepare your picks.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.460]   Whoop.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.460]   Whoop.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.660]   But first, I want to show you this.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.820]   My pick.
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:05.820]   What is that?
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.180]   The little box, that little tiny box.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.460]   It's got to tell you it's got a ethernet port on one side.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.940]   It's got a USB port.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:11.940]   Power supply.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.380]   That is the Landtronics X print server.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.860]   And that thing will change your life.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:22.580]   If you've ever tried to print from an iPhone or an iPad, you know that if you have one
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.580]   of those air print devices in there, I think they're all from HP.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.780]   I don't think I think that's the only ones that support air print.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.780]   I don't know what the latest is.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.420]   But you know, otherwise you have to get an app.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.420]   You have to set it up.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.420]   It's really complicated.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:34.420]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:39.380]   If you could take a printer, even a USB printer that's not on the network and print to it easily,
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.220]   simply from an iPhone or an iPad?
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.220]   That's awesome.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.220]   This is what this does.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.740]   It could take any USB printer, make it a network printer.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:50.380]   And it also auto discovers all the network printers on the network, makes them available
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.900]   and easy to access from your iOS.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.020]   You can, solves the frustration trying to print from an iPad or an iPhone.
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.220]   You go right from the native menu.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.580]   You don't have to buy any apps or install any software.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:02.220]   You don't even have to configure this thing.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.780]   You just plug it in.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:08.420]   It works with more than 4,000 top brand printers.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.820]   You're printing within seconds.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:16.940]   One X print server will support as many as eight USB printers and many network printers,
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.900]   depending on the device you get.
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.980]   All over the network, it's a great way to share USB printers with other users on the
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   network as well, not just iOS devices.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.500]   So this is the home edition.
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:30.060]   It supports 99, it's 99 bucks and supports eight printers and up to two network printers.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:33.380]   For any home, eight USB printers, two network printers, I don't think you got more than
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:38.260]   that, but if you do, if you're an officer, a bigger network for 199, you can get the
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:42.660]   office edition, which has unlimited network printers, eight USB printers, and includes
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:46.180]   some network admin features like Active Directory support.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.900]   This is an amazing deal.
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:52.500]   If you compare it with anything else on the market, you will end, I keep getting emails
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.060]   and tweets from people who've used it and say this was so easy.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.060]   I love it.

[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.260]   You've used it?
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.820]   Well, I've given it to people who are much less technically astute than me and they have
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820]   made it work, just very simply.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820]   There's nothing to do.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:24.780]   There's nothing to install, nothing.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.180]   Yeah, somebody said, why don't they do a parallel port version?
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.220]   I am a real baby.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.420]   There are still some people out there with parallel port printers.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   Hello, Epson.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.660]   How many stop bits do I need for the...
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:40.060]   I can't find the dip switches on my inkjet printer.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.260]   I remember those days.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:45.100]   Andy Inaco, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:49.540]   My pick of the week, especially since we've been talking about iPad Mini, is a product
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:52.100]   from a company that I recommended in the past different things.
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.100]   The Xmount Xgrip.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.100]   Whoa.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.140]   Yes, it was the next swing fighter.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.780]   Any tablet holder.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:02.300]   It's part of the Xmount RAM mount system.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:07.020]   I love this mounting system for just about everything because instead of selling you just
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:12.620]   like here is a plastic thing in a box for car mounting, or car mounting, or window mounting,
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:17.540]   or whatever mounting, or phone, they'll sell you a package or you can just buy the suction
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:22.660]   cup-y thing for putting it on the window or just the army bit because you want maybe
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:27.780]   an arm that's longer than this or just a... and then when you switch from one phone to
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.780]   another, you don't have to replace everything you have in your car.
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.260]   You just have to replace the thing that actually holds the thing.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:38.340]   So this is their new Xgrip system that will hold pretty much any large tablet.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:39.860]   Let me see if I can one-hand it.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:44.060]   You just spread the arms like this, put it inside.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.060]   Trying to one-hand this.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.060]   There you go.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:51.260]   And then, believe it or not, once you let go, it actually holds it really, really well.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.260]   Thank God it didn't fall.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:57.660]   And again, the cool thing about that is that when you're not using it for, if you were
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:04.180]   ever to switch to a different sort of thing, you can now use that for your Samsung Galaxy.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:06.220]   I don't have my... there you go.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:11.460]   Or if you... let's say that you took this with you because you're going on vacation,
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.780]   you're going on vacation and you're going to be in a rental car and you just wanted
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:19.260]   that just for like your in-car navigation, but hey, now you're on the plane and you want
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.260]   to like a stand for your Kindle.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:22.260]   This will work with your Kindle.
[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:25.660]   This will work with anything that's of a certain size.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:29.620]   They make a flavor of the same thing that is phone sized.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:33.140]   And so that will work with like your Samsung phone and then it will work with your iPhone
[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:35.900]   4 and you can switch from one thing to another to another.
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:40.020]   But like it's again, it's a clever design that works with just about anything.
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:45.980]   But the other selling point is that, again, other than these really cheaply made plastic
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:50.980]   things that you get that will work with one model of phone, but then as soon as you upgrade
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:54.860]   a year later, you've got to buy an entire other thing and replace everything.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.100]   With this one, it's really made extremely well.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:02.140]   These are... they make mounting kits for like law enforcement, for military, for all kinds
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.140]   of things.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.820]   Not only that, but again, you can just replace the parts that you need.
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.620]   I've got so many bits and bobs.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:12.180]   Ever since I bought my first Ram out thing three years ago that like whenever I'm shooting
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.620]   video inside the car, I take the head off of this.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.260]   I put in a camera mount and now it's about a window camera mount.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:22.940]   I've got different solutions for so many different things that it's just not funny.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:26.500]   But this part, the Xmount part is about 30 bucks.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:30.700]   If you want to put together this entire thing, I think this would probably cost you about
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:35.340]   40 or 50 because they will sell this as a package or as independent things.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.940]   But again, can't recommend Ram out highly enough.
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.020]   It's really price competitive with everything else and it's built way better than anything
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.460]   else you're going to find in the market.
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:48.340]   Rammount.com, the X-Grip.
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:50.180]   It's spring loaded so it'll adjust.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:54.620]   Spring loaded, again, you wouldn't think that it's actually going to hold on to this
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.740]   thing but it really does grip it tightly.
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:57.740]   I took it.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:05.460]   This is the first time that I actually was driving around with a mini tablet locked into
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.820]   my car dashboard.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.420]   And man, it is a trip.
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:16.060]   It is a scene man to have this floating inside your peripheral vision, especially when you're
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.340]   watching Lord of the Rings while Bob and Don 995.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.340]   Now that was adventurous.
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:20.340]   Learn about football.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:21.340]   Exactly.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:27.100]   Learning, making sure that I know all about the traffic type I'm about to create by crashing.
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.300]   But yeah, it's incredibly solid.
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:32.500]   This does not move at all.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:36.220]   When it comes time to leave your car, you just do this and it's out.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:37.220]   That's it.
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.220]   You don't have to click it into anything.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:43.420]   The points are all encoded in rubber so you're not going to scratch your beautiful, adnized
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:44.660]   aluminum finish.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   They really did this correctly.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.260]   It's got a better grip than Kelly Clarkson at the inauguration.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.260]   Oh, smack.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.260]   Did you see that?
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   Didn't see it.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.980]   Did you not see my screen?
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:57.940]   Are you busy?
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:58.940]   Sorry.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:05.020]   There are a couple of things came out of the inauguration.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:12.540]   Somebody had a caption contest and my favorite was, "Hey, nice grip there, lady."
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.340]   You saw...
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:18.740]   There's another one, Michelle Obama and John Boehner.
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.740]   Did you see that one?
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:20.740]   No.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:21.740]   Yes, the animated GIF.
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.740]   Yeah, there's an animated GIF.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.940]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:32.740]   I'm not sure what really happened, but it's a great animated GIF.
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:36.420]   Let me see if I can find one that's actually animated.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.780]   Did you see the photo of everyone texting?
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:40.780]   There's probably some down.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:41.780]   Oh, yeah, there's texts everywhere.
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:42.780]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:43.780]   There was one shot.
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:44.780]   There was one shot down there.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.780]   There was one shot down there.
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:46.780]   Where?
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:51.100]   Literally, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, their kids, everyone are all at the inauguration.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.380]   They're all heads down in their perspective mobile device.
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.380]   Let's see.
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:57.380]   I think it's from Atlanta.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:58.980]   Well, it's a big deal.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.980]   If I were being sworn in as the president, I'd probably be texting my friends to let them
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:04.060]   know how cool the day was.
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:05.540]   Yeah, sure.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.060]   In case they hadn't heard, I would have told them before that.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:10.060]   That's a good point.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.660]   There's nothing private.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.660]   There's nothing private.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.660]   It's a tumblebrag.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:17.420]   Yeah, here you go.
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.020]   It's pretty funny.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:25.700]   Gee, this is not as good as the one I've seen.
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:28.980]   Let me see if I can see it on Tumblr.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:36.940]   We don't know what President Obama was saying to John Boehner, but it was clear that here
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:37.940]   we go.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:38.940]   Here we go.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:39.940]   Here's the eye roll.
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:41.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:42.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:43.940]   Hold it.
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.940]   Wait.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:56.340]   We don't really know what's going on, but we can probably say it was better.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:00.380]   First eye roll.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.140]   She has a Twitter account now, right?
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:05.180]   She has Austin Powers, because that's probably, that's really played out.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.380]   That would get an eye roll.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:09.980]   Oh, Behave Ms. Firstly.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.220]   Oh, Behave.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.540]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.300]   My pick of the week is a Mac app.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:21.180]   It's called Napkin, and it's for very quick annotation of images.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.820]   It's put together by Chris Parrish.
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.420]   It used to be at Adobe, and then was at Rogue Sheep.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:29.220]   Thomas Unteberger, who did the visual design for screens, which I really liked, and Guy
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.220]   English.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.220]   We'll have to disclose.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:34.140]   He's a friend of mine, but I think this app is really good in spite of that.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:38.220]   And he did video games, and he did tapulas and a bunch of other stuff since then.
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.460]   And they made, basically it's an app.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:42.100]   You just drag images into it.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:45.580]   You can quickly do callouts, quickly do arrows, quickly add shapes.
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.540]   And the goal was to make a Mac app that works almost like an iOS app.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:50.980]   There's almost no intermediation.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:53.140]   You just quickly gesture on a shape, and it's there.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.140]   You gesture at an hour.
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140]   You're like this.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.300]   You drop a call out.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.740]   It is incredibly fast.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:03.700]   We have switched to doing all our how-to's on iMore using napkin.
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:08.500]   Now, it's close to a $40 app, but at a certain point, your time is worth way more than your
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.500]   money.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:13.340]   And this is so fast at getting the kind of stuff done that we do.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:18.500]   Also developers are using it to send to submit bugs or to mock up design charts.
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:22.060]   It's one of the best Mac apps I've used in a long time.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:27.020]   Just the way it's coded, the way it works, and the work that it lets me do with it.
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.980]   So if you work in development, if you work in design, if you work in any sort of technical
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:37.700]   documentation and just want to get stuff done quickly, you can even, once you've done a
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:42.380]   drawing there, you just drag the little icon in the top right, and you can drag it right
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:47.380]   into Photoshop, right into a file, right into an email, and it packages the image for you.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.940]   It's non-destructive, you can do all sorts of really cool things.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:55.260]   And if you just draw a circle with your maths, you'll see it'll automatically, it's very
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.500]   good at knowing what you want to do, and just figuring it out.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.260]   Once you put an arrow, you move stuff, the arrow follows with you.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.060]   And how would you compare this to like, Skitch?
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:06.700]   It is what Skitch should have been.
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:10.180]   It's a 1.0 product though, so I mean, it's not feature complete yet.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.180]   They're still working on it.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:14.540]   They're doing a lot of things, but what it does, basically, it does right.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:18.420]   And for example, you draw a circle, you decide you want a rectangle or a round rectangle,
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:21.780]   instead, you don't have to delete anything because programmatically they're the same.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.100]   You just change the border attribute, it becomes a square, a rectangle.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.220]   So there's some sort of vector drawing.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:32.140]   And what is the format that it's sharing it out in?
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.620]   I mean, you can say it as an actual napkin file, but if you drag it out, it's just a
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.620]   ping file.
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620]   It's a PNG you can do with--
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620]   It's animated or--
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.620]   It's not animated.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.620]   It's not animated.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:41.620]   It's 2D now.
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:48.420]   So you're marking up-- for something you might have drawn out Adobe-- the PDF version of
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.540]   Adobe, but Acrobat at one point to do.
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:52.740]   And you no longer need something that heavy.
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:55.700]   And it's super lightweight, super fast.
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.020]   And again, if you just-- if you get sent a drawing, like, no, I don't want this area,
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:03.020]   I want that area, or I want this color, you can call that out really quickly, get it in,
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.900]   get it out, and your back get work.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.300]   And it's in the app store.
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:11.540]   It's called napkin.
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.540]   Yes.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:15.740]   And in the desktop app store, it's a Mac app.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.900]   It looks like it's made for the iPad, so I'm really hoping they get around to an iPad
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:19.900]   for each--
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.060]   So cool to have this for the iPad.
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.900]   They started it before the iPad was actually announced.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.820]   And the idea was, why can't we have big screen apps that work the way iPhone apps did?
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:31.460]   And then, you know, after they were developing it, Apple announced an iPad.
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:33.860]   So it's easy to see that translation.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:36.660]   Well, I just bought it.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.740]   Yeah, I'm definitely going to get it.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.620]   And right now, I use a Skitch all the time.
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.620]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:43.620]   Like, that's fine.
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:44.620]   Skitch is similar.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.620]   It's similar.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:46.620]   I think this one looks like it has more features.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620]   And I see about Skitches here.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.620]   It saves it automatically to Evernote now, because Evernote--
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.620]   And this, you just chime in the new place.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.380]   But I just have to pick a text tool.
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:53.380]   It just works.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.380]   Right.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   This is cool.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.380]   It's a little bit like Omnigraffle, a little bit, too.
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:58.380]   A little bit of everything.
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   It's a tool that they made for a job that they're doing, and they use it all the time.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.780]   And that's usually the best sign of the setup.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:08.580]   So it's like their version of keynote, where the stuff that they had to make sure the
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.900]   boss was using every single day.
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:14.740]   So, oh, man, does that make sure it gets done well very, very quickly.
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:20.180]   And the Apple Developer Community is very small, and they tend to know each other.
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:24.620]   So if there's anything wrong with the developer tool, you hear about it very quickly.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:27.980]   And finally, Alex, Lindsay, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:30.700]   So I have one pick from myself, and then one from my wife, actually.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.700]   Oh, I'm sure.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:32.700]   Excuse you.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.940]   So the one that I'm going to pick is a lot of people take a lot more photos with their
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:37.940]   iPhone.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:43.300]   And if you're looking for kind of a really quick guide to shooting with your iPhone,
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:47.140]   using the different hardware and software, actually a Pixelcore member put together a
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:53.660]   book that's now in an iBook, and it's called How to Create Amazing iPhone Photographs.
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:55.220]   And it's $3.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:00.300]   So it's, you know, and this is, I really want to see part of it is it's a great book.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:02.020]   I mean, he's just really kind of geeks out.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:06.380]   So this is Michael Sweeney, and he kind of geeks out on different pieces of hardware.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.380]   And of course, all of that's changing constantly.
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.900]   But he kind of gives you some ideas about how to shoot.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:16.380]   I mean, he's got the cover is this moonshot that I still can't believe was shot with an
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:17.380]   iPhone.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:21.260]   So but anyway, the, but all the photographs, of course, are shot with an iPhone, and he
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:24.420]   talks about different hardware appliances and software appliances.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.940]   And again, for three bucks, if you're just trying to get ahead and see all the things
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.460]   that you can do, this is an easy, easy buy.
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:37.860]   So, you know, it's great little eye and what I'm hoping for, I guess, is I want to see more
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:38.860]   books like this.
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:41.700]   In fact, I'm thinking of creating a couple books like this, where they're really quick.
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700]   They're easy.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.700]   It's 100 pages.
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.700]   It's in an iBook format.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.180]   And you can, you know, for $3.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:50.700]   I mean, I think that is the future for a lot of book selling.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:54.100]   And I definitely, I think people, and there's some, you know, there's video, there's some
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:55.100]   interactive materials.
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:56.660]   There's all kinds of little bits and pieces in there.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.140]   So definitely check it out.
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:01.820]   And, you know, as I said, it's a cost of a coffee to learn more about how to take good
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:03.460]   pictures with your, with your iPhone.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:07.540]   And a lot of us, of course, if you're listening to the show, probably want to know more about
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:08.540]   that.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.580]   So how to create amazing iPhone photographs by Michael Sweeney.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.420]   And then my, my wife's pick, my wife doesn't get very many apps.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:16.140]   So when she gets an app that says she really likes it, she says she really likes it.
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:20.140]   I think there's some, some of her audience that would like to know is she's my wife loves.
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:21.140]   It's called grocery IQ.
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:22.140]   Have you guys?
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:23.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.140]   I use that.
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:25.140]   I've used that for years.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.300]   So it's cross platform too, which is great.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:32.580]   So you can keep your grocery lists on any device, computer, tablet, phone.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:33.580]   Exactly.
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:39.260]   And my wife, you know, she was just really trying to figure out what she can use on her,
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:43.700]   on her iPhone that would let her, you know, while she's thinking about it, write something
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.540]   down and then also very quickly and easily be able to, you know, when she, when she's
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:50.820]   already, when she's at the grocery store, the big problem with a lot of the list is A,
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:54.900]   they were too hard to create or B, they just didn't, they weren't really good at feedback,
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.700]   like while you're at the store clicking on them.
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:58.700]   And it didn't break them into the section.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.620]   So what's really nice also is this breaks it into sections.
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.620]   So when you put something in, it categorizes all the, the dairy products with the dairy
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.620]   products and all the other pieces so that, you know, when you're not.
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:09.060]   And you can even tell it to lay out of the store so that it knows.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:11.460]   Oh, you're, you're at a Petaluma market.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.620]   Well, here's where the eye, here's what's in these aisles.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:14.620]   Yeah, really great.
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:15.620]   Really, really great.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:21.100]   Anyway, so it's called grocery IQ and, and it's approved by my wife, which is a very
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.100]   cool.
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.560]   I wish it had Siri integration because, you know, I still now make my lists because of
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.540]   the Siri and reminders, right, because I could just talk to it.
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.460]   And if that has Siri integration, that would be awesome.
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:32.500]   We've got Apple, you got to open this API or something.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:33.500]   Yes.
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:34.500]   Let developers use it.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:35.500]   Yes.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.040]   I have a couple of picks.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.860]   I'll tell you, I'll, I'll give you my, my pick and I can't really show it to you, but
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:40.860]   it's is the new iMac.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:42.740]   I've had enough for a week.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:43.740]   Very fast.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.740]   I got the fusion drives.
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.340]   No, is this, is this the 27?
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.380]   Yeah, 27 skinny.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:51.740]   So it's, it's only skinny if you look at it right, right?
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.740]   Right.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:56.000]   So you turn it, you see the bulge, but you, it still is like an optical illusion amount.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.680]   You get pretty far around before you go.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.680]   Wow.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.680]   It's also much lighter.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.000]   We noticed immediately it's much lighter, really does feel like a whole different thing.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.760]   And it is super fast, noticeably faster, even in the last year iMac that I had, I had
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760]   a late model iMac.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.160]   And the terra, the, oh, here it comes.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:16.800]   This is, it's so light that John just brought it right over the terabyte drive in it.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.480]   I'm next to it.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.480]   I'm next to it.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480]   Bring me the iMac.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.720]   So you see how thin it is.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.140]   It's one of those things just like the, the MacBook Air where you've got a thin bezel
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.260]   and then it bulges in the middle.
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:31.860]   The ball is still not as thick as an i as the older iMac.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:35.760]   And it's, it's appreciably thinner and it makes the screen look really good because the
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.500]   screen just seems to be this piece of glass floating in its place.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:43.660]   Also that, that fusion drive, you know, that's the drive where it's two drives, SSD, right?
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:49.740]   I think a hundred, 60 gig SSD and then a spinning three terabyte drive noticeably fast.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.100]   I actually have done some benchmark tests on it.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:56.820]   And of course, it's hard to benchmark test because it gets faster.
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:57.980]   So it's a little deceptive.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.200]   What happens is the, is, is mountain, what you're doing and watches what you're doing
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.140]   and puts the drives you access most often.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:11.440]   The files you access most often on the solid state drive is not, it's not, you know, it's
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.540]   constantly changing.
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:17.540]   So I do have a benchmark that I did with the black magic speed test.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.220]   And what I'll do is I'll compare this.
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:24.580]   This is the other world computing mercury SSD that I have on the right that I have in
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.580]   my Mac book here.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.180]   I'm sorry in the, the retinets.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:35.740]   So 504 megabytes a second megabytes, not bits second read, 308 megabytes a second right.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:36.740]   That's a fast SSD.
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:40.780]   But if you go over and you look at now, this is the fusion three terabytes.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:43.740]   It's two, it's very close, 286 four megabytes per second.
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.500]   Here's my question is how long will it do that?
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.460]   If it's a really big file, will it run out?
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.460]   These are five gig files.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:51.900]   I'm using the five gig on the black magic speed test.
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:56.780]   And furthermore, it got better as I kept reading and writing that file.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:59.500]   Of course, it sped up because it moved it to the SSD.
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.220]   So this is without reading and writing it for too long and it got even faster, but
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:07.580]   383 megabytes a second read compared to 504.
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:09.420]   So it's about 20% less.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:15.140]   And 286 megabytes per second right compared to 308, still much faster than a traditional
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.780]   spinning drive really recommended.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:19.580]   I have to say this new iMac.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:20.580]   But it's great.
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.660]   It's looking at these new iMacs that has me not think that we're not going to get another
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:30.700]   Mac Pro because well, once you start accessorizing with Thunderbolt, you know, and adding a lot
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.700]   of the things that you would normally with a Mac Pro, I think that you end up solving
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.460]   90% of the problems that people have.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:40.420]   Now, some people are saying in the chat room that bootcamp is not working on the fusion
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:41.420]   drives.
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:42.420]   Do you know anything like that?
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:44.140]   Windows does not understand a fusion drive.
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:45.140]   Right.
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:51.140]   And so this is in the, certainly the optimizations are built into OS 10.
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:52.140]   Right.
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.260]   Does, I don't know, I haven't tried putting bootcamp on there.
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:55.260]   Will bootcamp not work?
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:59.020]   I think it's, I think from, in point of view, the hardware would still look like a single
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:00.020]   drive.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.020]   Right.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.020]   Unless I'm completely mistaken.
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:04.620]   That's what people were saying on, in the chat room, I haven't tried it.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:05.620]   I haven't tried it.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:12.060]   But yeah, I think that it's, you know, I, I'm not rushing to install Windows 8 on this,
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:15.100]   to be honest, to be perfectly frank.
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.700]   But I guess I should try it.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.460]   Touch screen is worthless, Neil.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:21.460]   That's right.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:22.460]   You need a touch screen.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:27.300]   So, Apple highlighted the issue on both its iMac configuration, fusion drive explanation
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:34.620]   page bootcamp assistant is not supported at this time on three terabyte configurations
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:35.620]   at this time.
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:36.620]   Right.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:42.740]   So you do a software's parallels or a VMware fusion or one box to run Windows on it.
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:44.620]   It's not the end of the world as far as I'm concerned.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620]   No, it's great.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:49.900]   And we got the 21 inch for my, my parents in law and they, for Christmas and they.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.100]   Now that doesn't have the fusion at all.
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.380]   So I don't think you have to worry about that.
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:54.380]   No, it's great.
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:58.340]   Oh, that's interesting that I didn't realize you can't use bootcamp on it.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:04.100]   It's just, I mean, for whatever percentage, you know, needs to get, I'll get that one guy
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:05.100]   by.
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:07.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:11.540]   Well, if you, if you really need to run Windows in native mode on what the new iMac don't
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:12.540]   get the fusion drive.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.540]   Right.
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:14.540]   Right.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:15.540]   Absolutely.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.540]   If that's really the direction you're going to.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:17.820]   But if you're running as a native Mac, it is fast.
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.820]   It's awesome.
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.820]   It is fast.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.860]   And to get three terabytes is at that kind of speed is really great.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.540]   No, I'm, I'm finally, I have a desktop still sitting in my, in my house and I'm finally
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:31.060]   looking at it going, you know, I don't really want to pay for that heating bill.
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:35.380]   It is the heater actually for the room is my, is my, is my Mac.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:37.620]   And so I'm thinking of getting, getting it out of the office.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:41.520]   I've been holding out for the new Mac Pro, but when you parse Tim Cook's words carefully
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.340]   he says that I'll have something for pro users.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.340]   Not necessarily.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:46.380]   Oh, it is a say, I'll have a new Mac Pro in 2013.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:50.820]   No, it says for a way to run you Mac Pro is something like we'll have something for you
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:51.820]   next year.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.820]   It's not as specific as.
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:56.820]   So not give you a snack preview right here.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:59.020]   It's one of these five.
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:02.260]   And, and, you know, someone was asking in the, in the, in the chat room, you know, about
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:06.460]   Mac minis versus what, whether you need a Mac mini or, or an iMac and I think that for
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.620]   most people I would say an iMac is a better solution just because it's all in one.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:10.620]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:14.640]   We have about, we have a lot of both.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.600]   Mac mini is a great because you, you, you separate the Mac mini from the monitor.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:21.000]   So you can have a whole bunch of Mac mini stacked up somewhere and a whole bunch of monitors
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   somewhere else.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]   I mean, that's, that's really the time we get it.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]   But otherwise I'll get it specialized.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.640]   It's a very specialized server more or being able to have, again, have them all in one
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.360]   place and have my monitors in another.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.600]   But I think that for the most part, I think that the 27 and 21 are the best computers that
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.600]   Apple has made.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.200]   What desktop computers?
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.200]   And they're selling really well apparently.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.940]   Evidently, it's hard to get them.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:43.940]   What, really?
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:48.020]   Yeah, the, the, the 21 inch now is now up to two or three weeks rather than seven, ten
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:49.020]   days.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.020]   Oh, I feel lucky.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.020]   So slowing down.
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:53.020]   I ordered this a couple of months ago, but I'm happy I did.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.020]   I wish I had, it's replaced the other Mac.
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.020]   What happened to the old Mac?
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.380]   It's now a Skype machine, I think.
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:01.860]   It's absorbed, it's absorbed into the Borg.
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:02.860]   The door, man.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:04.460]   Renee Richie is at imore.com.
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:05.460]   A great website.
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.460]   You must visit i-m-o-r-e.com.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:09.620]   He joins us every week from Montreal.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.680]   Hope you're staying warm this winter, Renee.
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.840]   It's, it's been up and down, Leo.
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:17.560]   It gets warm long enough to entice us out of our homes and then phrases us solid again.
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.560]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.480]   And thanks to Alex Lindsey.
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.480]   Appreciate your time.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.480]   It's good to be here.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.480]   Good to see you.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.560]   As a quick reminder, number one is I, I've been posting a bunch of stuff about Mac on
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.720]   the, on my G plus page.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.480]   So if you search G plus, you'll find me there.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.560]   And then also we have a G plus community for Mac break.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.560]   Yes.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.560]   So just as a, for Mac break weekly.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.560]   I'm really running that.
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.460]   So I think I'm kind of, I've kind of put it together.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.320]   And so there's, there's eight or 900 people already already in the community, but we'd
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:46.320]   love to have you.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.340]   So if you're listening to the show, go to the G plus communities and search for Mac
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.940]   break weekly.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:53.860]   And it's, it's, I've added a whole bunch of little bits and pieces.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.960]   And we had this great thing where we asked people to start.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.740]   I, I shared my, my home screen from my iPhone and, and, and,
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:00.740]   Well, that's like there was idea.
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:03.380]   There was always a slew of them all of people, people sharing them.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:04.380]   And I just think it's very interesting.
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:05.540]   How do you know what's that?
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:09.680]   So I'm, you know, I have to admit that I'm playing a little bit in the, you know, social
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.560]   experiment of what can we do with that community.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:17.200]   So we're just getting started and, but we hope that more people, more people jump into
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.960]   the, to the G plus community communities are just people to be honest.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:21.260]   Well, we haven't talked about it at all.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.760]   I don't, I think it's the first time we talked about it on the show.
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.880]   So all Mac, all the time, Mac break weekly.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.040]   Alex Lindsey is a moderator.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:29.040]   I think I am as well.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.640]   Yeah, you are.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:33.600]   And I will start spending more time in there actually.
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.780]   We, we wanted to think, we were thinking about, you were thinking about maybe using this for
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:38.180]   stories or, yeah.
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:41.000]   So I, one of the things I was thinking is in the news, you know, you could, you could
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.620]   give us a hand by posting some of the stories that you're talking about next week.
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:46.620]   Right.
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.680]   So put it in the news, maybe, and I'm going to try to start putting more stuff in the
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:51.500]   news as well so that you, you kind of see the things that we're thinking about as far
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:52.500]   as news for the next week.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:57.320]   We could do that on a Mondays, Chad is a put our rundown, our preliminary rundown on
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:01.220]   Monday into people talking and let, and, and get your input.
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:03.220]   We could do that.
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.840]   We could just the doc on Monday night.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:05.840]   So I could do that.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:09.200]   And then one of the things I'm looking at doing is also like tips and tricks and so on and
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.360]   so forth that we might incorporate into the show at some point in time and talk about,
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.840]   you know, some of the things, the apps that we should be thinking about when we're trying
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:22.000]   to think about what these, you know, what, you know, you can give us guides on things
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.800]   that we might want to recommend.
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:26.080]   So it's a great way for you to kind of have a two way communication.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:29.480]   There's a lot of people that are, it's a pretty active group.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.480]   It is great.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:36.420]   And I'm really, I think that the, you know, these communities are going to build up to
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:39.780]   me now this revitalized my interest in Google plus.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:41.900]   I think the communities are a great feature.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:48.020]   And I got to point out that Mac break weekly has, what did you say?
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.140]   900 members that I think eight hundred and seventy.
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:51.660]   That's good.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:53.980]   But this week in Google has more than 3000.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:54.980]   So we got to get to work.
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:55.980]   Yes.
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:56.980]   Get more people in there.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:58.700]   So join have your friends join.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:02.680]   It's not that we're not competitive or anything, but participate.
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:03.680]   When can we deliver it?
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.640]   Did start working Leo started working right after the show last week for Google plus.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:07.640]   Oh, good.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:09.640]   Oh, good.
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:10.640]   That's great.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:11.640]   Thanks, Alex, for being here.
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:12.640]   Will we see you next week?
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.640]   Yes.
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:14.640]   Great.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:20.560]   Mr. Andy Enaco Chicago, Sun times last day as an eight bit character or at least the
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:26.400]   last day that we can not blame Skype or some other provider.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:31.060]   Next week, if there are problems, I can once again start cursing at Skype.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.980]   Just an update for those of you watching live.
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:35.000]   There was a lot of chatter during the show.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.540]   Sarah Lane was in a car accident.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.220]   She was in Doyle Drive heading.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.220]   Thanks.
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.060]   Was she here for TNT?
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:42.060]   She was.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.620]   So she was heading home.
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:47.380]   She said that in her Twitter, there were huge buckets of water gushing from the ceiling.
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:50.220]   She jammed on her brakes and was rear ended and slammed into the wall.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:51.220]   Her car was totaled.
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:54.220]   She's on her way to the emergency room, but she's tweeting.
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:55.340]   So we know she's conscious.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:58.240]   I think she's conscious, unless she's unconsciously tweeting.
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:53:59.240]   Right.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.240]   That's a new feature.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:04.200]   But I said her a note saying you don't have to answer this, but let us know if you need
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.440]   anything and we will certainly keep you up today.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:10.360]   And I know there's so many people who adore Sarah, including myself.
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:14.280]   So we will absolutely keep an eye on Sarah and let you know how she's doing.
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:18.720]   She's well enough to tweet anyway.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:22.040]   Usually if it's a life threatening injury, people don't, I find don't don't know Twitter
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.840]   about it.
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:24.840]   But I might be wrong.
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:25.840]   I'm moving into a new age.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:28.340]   When I have my heart attack, I'm going to tweet it.
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.340]   I have a high.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.440]   I can't move my left hand.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.540]   Stay away for stay ahead of the story.
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.540]   Breaking news.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:36.540]   Chad Johnson.
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:40.080]   And I wanted to mention that we have a new YouTube channel.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.340]   Thank you for reminding me.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:51.880]   You can head on over to youtube.com/macbreak and this is where our new episodes will be uploaded.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:58.920]   So if it used to be, it used to upload to the youtube.com/twit channel that has been
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.640]   repurposed.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:06.640]   So if you would like to, go on over to youtube.com/macbreakweekly and subscribe to that channel
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.080]   and you'll only get Macbreak weekly videos.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.600]   Not by the way, Macbreak, but Macbreak weekly, very important.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:13.600]   There is no Macbreak.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:16.600]   I'm just sure you should run out and get it.
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:23.320]   You can still go to youtube.com/twit and find our promo specials, things like that.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.160]   And what you'll also find on the right hand side of the screen is a list of each show's
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.440]   direct YouTube link.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.760]   That way, if you can't remember it and sometimes it's not obvious, you'll be able to see the
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:35.760]   YouTube channel.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.840]   We did this because this way you can subscribe more granularly to the shows that you want
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:42.080]   to get notifications about.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.040]   So we are going to work on returning an all-in-one feed.
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.160]   We had one on our website which was accidentally disabled.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.320]   We're going to put that back.
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.080]   It may already happen.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.160]   It happened within hours of us talking about it last time.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:01.440]   And then we're also working on a unified YouTube feed for the crazy ones.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.360]   Here's the crazy ones who want every single show.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:20.120]   So if I go to twitter.tv/feeds/node/feed, I will now once again get a all-feed feed,
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.120]   all shows feed.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:22.120]   Good.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:23.280]   Thank you for getting that back.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.680]   We wouldn't want to lose that.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.680]   Yep.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:26.680]   Watch my Google Reader.
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:27.680]   That's good.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:28.680]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.000]   We do the show 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern Time every Tuesday on twitter.tv.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.320]   That's 1900 UTC if you want to watch live.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.760]   We'd love it.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:41.440]   As you can see, we interact with the chat room whether we want to or not.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.200]   They interact with us.
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.160]   But we also have on-demand versions available after the fact.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:53.120]   Both audio and video at twitter.tv/mbw for Mac break weekly.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.480]   And of course, wherever you get iTunes, wherever you get Puckus iTunes and all of that.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.480]   Throw in Zoon.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:01.320]   Just throw in a bone.
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.880]   Throw me a frickin' bone.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.120]   It's actually cheaper to throw in a Zoon.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.120]   All pre-users?
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.120]   Go ahead.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:10.120]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.120]   Get back to work.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.640]   Break time is over!
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:18.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:21.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:24.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
